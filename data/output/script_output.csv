"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,...and harmony has been maintained in Equestria for generations since. Hmm... Elements of Harmony. I know I've heard of those before... but where?
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,"Oh, sorry, girls... I've got a lot of studying to catch up on."
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,I know I've heard of the Elements of Harmony.
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,spike,Ow!
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,Spike! Spi-ike! Spike?
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,"There you are. Quick, find me that old copy of Predictions and Prophecies. What's that for?"
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,spike,"Well, it was a gift for Moon Dancer, but..."
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,"Oh Spike, you know we don't have time for that sort of thing."
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,spike,But we're on a break!
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,"No, no, no... no, no, no! [grunts] Spike!"
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,spike,It's over here!
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,"Ah! Elements, Elements, E, E, E... Aha! Elements of Harmony, see: Mare in the Moon?"
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,spike,Mare in the Moon? But that's just an old ponies' tale.
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,"Mare, mare... aha! The Mare in the Moon, myth from olden pony times. A powerful pony who wanted to rule Equestria, defeated by the Elements of Harmony and imprisoned in the moon. Legend has it that on the longest day of the thousandth year, the stars will aid in her escape, and she will bring about nighttime eternal! [gasp] Spike! Do you know what this means?"
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,spike,No<U+0097> whoa!
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,spike,Ow!
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,"Take a note please, to the Princess."
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,spike,Okie dokie.
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,"My dearest teacher, my continuing studies of pony magic have led me to discover that we are on the precipice of disaster!"
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,spike,Hold on. Preci... preci...
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,Threshold.
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,spike,Threh...
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,"Uh, brink? Ugh, that something really bad is about to happen! For you see, the mythical Mare in the Moon is in fact Nightmare Moon, and she's about to return to Equestria, and bring with her eternal night! Something must be done to make sure this terrible prophecy does not come true. I await your quick response. Your faithful student, Twilight Sparkle."
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,spike,Twi... light Spar... kle. Got it!
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,Great! Send it.
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,spike,Now?
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,Of course!
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,spike,"Uh, I dunno, Twilight, Princess Celestia's a little busy getting ready for the Summer Sun Celebration. And it's like, the day after tomorrow."
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,"That's just it, Spike. The day after tomorrow is the thousandth year of the Summer Sun Celebration! It's imperative that the Princess is told right away!"
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,spike,Impera... impera...
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,Important!
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,spike,Whoa!
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,spike,"Okay, okay! [inhale] There, it's on its way. But I wouldn't hold your breath..."
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,"Oh, I'm not worried, Spike. The Princess trusts me completely. In all the years she's been my mentor she's never once doubted me."
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,See? I knew she would want to take immediate action.
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,spike,"[clears throat] My dearest, most faithful student Twilight. You know that I value your diligence and that I trust you completely."
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,Mm-hm!
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,spike,...but you simply must stop reading those dusty old books!
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,spike,"My dear Twilight, there is more to a young pony's life than studying, so I'm sending you to supervise the preparations for the Summer Sun Celebration in this year's location: Ponyville. And, I have an even more essential task for you to complete: make some friends!"
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,spike,"Look on the bright side, Twilight. The Princess arranged for you to stay in a library. Doesn't that make you happy?"
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,"Yes, yes it does. You know why? Because I'm right! I'll check on the preparations as fast as I can, then get to the library to find some proof of Nightmare Moon's return."
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,spike,"Then... when will you make friends, like the Princess said?"
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,"She said to check on preparations. I am her student, and I'll do my royal duty, but the fate of Equestria does not rest on me making friends."
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,"Thank you, sirs."
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,spike,"Maybe the ponies in Ponyville have interesting things to talk about. Come on, Twilight, just try!"
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,Um... hello?
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,"Well, that was interesting all right."
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,spike,"Summer Sun Celebration official overseer's checklist. Number one, banquet preparations: Sweet Apple Acres."
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,applejack,Yeehaw!
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,[sigh] Let's get this over with... Good afternoon. My name is Twilight Sparkle<U+0097>
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,applejack,"Well, howdy-doo, Miss Twilight, a pleasure makin' your acquaintance. I'm Applejack. We here at Sweet Apple Acres sure do like makin' new friends!"
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,"Friends? Actually, I<U+0097>"
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,applejack,"So, what can I do you for?"
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,"[clears throat] Well, I am in fact here to supervise preparations for the Summer Sun Celebration. And you're in charge of the food?"
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,applejack,We sure as sugar are! Would you care to sample some?
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,As long as it doesn't take too long...
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,applejack,"Soup's on, everypony!"
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,applejack,"Now, why don't I introduce y'all to the Apple family?"
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,"Thanks, but I really need to hurry<U+0097>"
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,applejack,"This here's Apple Fritter. Apple Bumpkin. Red Gala. Red Delicious, Golden Delicious, Caramel Apple, Apple Strudel, Apple Tart, Baked Apples, Apple Brioche, Apple Cinnamon Crisp... [deep breath] Big McIntosh, Apple Bloom and Granny Smith. Up'n'attem, Granny Smith, we got guests."
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,granny smith,"[snort] Wha..? Soup's on? I'm up, here I come, ahm comin'..."
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,applejack,"Why, I'd say you're already part of the family!"
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,"[spit] [nervous laughter] Okay, well, I can see the food situation is handled, so we'll be on our way."
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,apple bloom,Aren't you gonna stay for brunch?
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,"Sorry, but we have an awful lot to do..."
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,...fine.
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,spike,"Food's all taken care of, next is weather."
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,Ugh... I ate too much pie...
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,spike,"Hmm, there's supposed to be a Pegasus pony named Rainbow Dash clearing the clouds."
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,"Well, she's not doing a very good job, is she?"
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,Nng.
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,Nnnn.
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,rainbow dash,[laughter] Lemme help you.
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,Let me guess. You're Rainbow Dash.
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,rainbow dash,"The one and only. Why, you heard of me?"
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,"I heard you were supposed to be keeping the sky clear. [sigh] I'm Twilight Sparkle, and the Princess sent me to check on the weather."
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,rainbow dash,"Yeah, yeah, that'll be a snap. I'll do it in a jiffy. Just as soon as I'm done practicing."
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,Practicing for what?
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,rainbow dash,"The Wonderbolts! They're gonna perform at the Celebration tomorrow, and I'm gonna show 'em my stuff!"
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,The Wonderbolts?
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,rainbow dash,Yep!
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,The most talented flyers in all of Equestria?
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,rainbow dash,That's them!
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,Pfft! Please. They'd never accept a Pegasus who can't even keep the sky clear for one measly day.
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,rainbow dash,"Hey, I could clear this sky in ten seconds flat."
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,Prove it.
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,rainbow dash,"[sounds of exertion] Loop-de-loop around, and wham! What'd I say? Ten. Seconds. Flat. I'd never leave Ponyville hanging. [sheep baaing] [chuckles] You should see the look on your face. Ha! You're a laugh, Twilight Sparkle. I can't wait to hang out some more."
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,Rrgh.
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,spike,Wait! It's kinda pretty once you get used to it!
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,spike,Decorations. Beautiful...
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,"Yes, the d<e9>cor is coming along nicely. This ought'a be quick. I'll be at the library in no time. Beautiful indeed."
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,spike,"Not the d<e9>cor, her!"
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,rarity,"No, no, no, oh! Goodness no."
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,spike,How are my spines? Are they straight?
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,Good afternoon<U+0097>
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,rarity,"Just a moment, please! I'm 'in the zone', as it were. Oh, yes! Sparkle always does the trick, does it not? Why, Rarity, you are a talent. Now, um, how can I help yo<U+0097> [yelp] Oh my stars, darling! Whatever happened to your coiffure?!"
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,"Oh, you mean my mane? Well, it's a long story. I'm just here to check on the decorations, and then I'll be out of your hair!"
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,rarity,Out of my hair? What about your hair?!
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,Wait! Where are we going?! Help!
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,rarity,"No, no, uh-uh. Too green. Too yellow. Too poofy. Not poofy enough. Too frilly. Too... shiny. Now go on, my dear. You were telling me where you're from."
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,[wincing] I've... been sent... from Canterlot... to<U+0097>
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,rarity,Huh?
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,rarity,"Canterlot?! Oh, I am so envious! The glamour, the sophistication! I have always dreamed of living there! I can't wait to hear all about it! We are gonna be the best of friends, you and I... Emeralds?! What was I thinking? Let me get you some rubies!"
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,Quick! Before she decides to dye my coat a new color!
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,spike,Wasn't she wonderful?
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,"Focus, Casanova. What's next on the list?"
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,spike,"[clears throat] Oh, uh, music! It's the last one!"
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,fluttershy,"Oh my. Um, stop please, everyone, umm. Excuse me, sir? I mean no offense, but your rhythm is just a teeny-tiny bit off. Now, follow me, please. A-one, a-two, a-one two three-"
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,Hello!
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,"Oh my, I'm so sorry, I didn't mean to frighten your birds. I'm just here to check up on the music and it's sounding beautiful. [pause] I'm Twilight Sparkle. [pause] What's your name?"
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,fluttershy,[very quietly] Um... I'm Fluttershy.
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,"I'm sorry, what was that?"
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,fluttershy,[even quieter] Um... My name is Fluttershy.
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,Didn't quite catch that.
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,"[pause] Well, um, it looks like your birds are back, so I guess everything's in order. Keep up the good work!"
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,"Oookay. [to Spike] Well, that was easy."
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,fluttershy,[gasp] A baby dragon!
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,fluttershy,"Oh, I've never seen a baby dragon before. He's sooo cute!"
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,spike,"Well, well, well...!"
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,fluttershy,"Oh my, he talks. I didn't know dragons could talk. That's just so incredibly wonderful I, I just don't even know what to say!"
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,"Well, in that case we'd better be going."
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,fluttershy,"Wait, wait! What's his name?"
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,spike,I'm Spike.
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,fluttershy,"Hi Spike, I'm Fluttershy. Wow, a talking dragon! And what do dragons talk about?"
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,spike,"Well, what do you wanna know?"
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,fluttershy,Absolutely everything.
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,spike,Well... I started out as a cute little purple and green egg...
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,spike,"...and that's the story of my whole entire life! Well, up until today. Do you wanna hear about today?"
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,fluttershy,"Oh, yes, please!"
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,spike,Gyah!
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,"I am so sorry, how did we get here so fast? This is where I'm staying while in Ponyville and my poor baby dragon needs his sleep."
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,spike,No I don't<U+0097> whoa!
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,"Aww, wook at dat, he's so sweepy he can't even keep his widdle bawance!"
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,fluttershy,"Poor thing, you simply must get into bed..."
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,"Yes, yes, we'll get right on that. Well, g'night!"
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,spike,Huh. Rude much?
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,"Sorry, Spike, but I have to convince the Princess that Nightmare Moon is coming, and we're running out of time! I just need to be alone so I can study without a bunch of crazy ponies trying to make friends all the time. Now, where's the light?"
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,pinkie pie,Surprise!
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,pinkie pie,"Hi, I'm Pinkie Pie, and I threw this party just for you! Were you surprised? Were ya? Were ya? Huh huh huh?"
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,Very surprised. Libraries are supposed to be quiet.
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,pinkie pie,"Well, that's silly! What kind of welcome party would this be if it were quiet? I mean, duh, bo-ring! Y'see, I saw you when you first got here, remember? You were all ""hello"" and I was all [deep gasp], remember? Y'see I've never saw you before and if I've never saw you before that means you're new, 'cause I know everypony, and I mean everypony in Ponyville!"
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,pinkie pie,"And if you're new, that meant you haven't met anyone yet, and if you haven't met anyone yet, you must not have any friends, and if you don't have any friends then you must be lonely, and that made me so sad, then I had an idea, and that's why I went [deep gasp]! I must throw a great big ginormous super-duper spectacular welcome party and invite everyone in Ponyville! See? And now you have lots and lots of friends!"
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,applejack,"Are you all right, sugarcube?"
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,pinkie pie,"Aww, she's so happy she's crying!"
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,spike,"""Hot sauce""."
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,pinkie pie,Ooh... [with mouth full] What? It's good!
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,spike,"Hey Twilight! Pinkie Pie's starting ""pin the tail on the pony""! Wanna play?"
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,No! All the ponies in this town are crazy! Do you know what time it is?!
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,spike,"It's the eve of the Summer Sun Celebration. Everypony has to stay up, or they'll miss the Princess raise the sun! You really should lighten up, Twilight. It's a party!"
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,"Ugh, here I thought I'd have time to learn about the Elements of Harmony but, silly me, all this ridiculous friend-making has kept me from it! ""Legend has it that on the longest day of the thousandth year, the stars will aid in her escape, and she will bring about everlasting night."" I hope the Princess was right... I hope it really is just an old pony tale..."
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,spike,"C'mon, Twilight, it's time to watch the sunrise!"
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,pinkie pie,"Isn't this exciting? Are you excited, 'cause I'm excited, I've never been so excited<U+0097> well, except for the time that I saw you walking into town and I went [deep gasp] but I mean really, who can top that?"
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,mayor mare,"Fillies and gentlecolts, as mayor of Ponyville, it is my great pleasure to announce the beginning of the Summer Sun Celebration!"
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,mayor mare,"In just a few moments, our town will witness the magic of the sunrise, and celebrate this, the longest day of the year! And now, it is my great honor to introduce to you the ruler of our land, the very pony who gives us the sun and the moon each and every day, the good, the wise, the bringer of harmony to all of Equestria..."
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,fluttershy,Ready?
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,mayor mare,...Princess Celestia!
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,rarity,Huh?
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,This can't be good.
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,mayor mare,"Remain calm, everypony, there must be a reasonable explanation!"
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,pinkie pie,"Ooh, ooh, I love guessing games! Is she hiding?"
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,rarity,She's gone!
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,Oh no... Nightmare Moon!
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,nightmare moon,"Oh, my beloved subjects. It's been so long since I've seen your precious little sun-loving faces."
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,rainbow dash,What did you do with our Princess?!
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,applejack,"[muffled] Whoa there, Nelly..."
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,nightmare moon,"[chuckle] Why, am I not royal enough for you? Don't you know who I am?"
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,nightmare moon,Does my crown no longer count now that I have been imprisoned for a thousand years? Did you not recall the legend? Did you not see the signs?
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,I did. And I know who you are. You're the Mare in the Moon <U+0096> Nightmare Moon!
"Friendship is Magic, part 1",Lauren Faust,nightmare moon,"Well well well, somepony who remembers me. Then you also know why I'm here."
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,"""Elements of Harmony, see 'Mare in the Moon'""?"
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,spike,But that's just an old ponies' tale.
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,She will bring about nighttime eternal.
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,It's imperative that the princess is told right away.
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,I knew she would wanna take immediate action.
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,spike,"My dear Twilight, there is more to a young pony's life than studying. Make some friends!"
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,All the ponies in this town are crazy!
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,I hope the Princess was right.
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,rarity,She's gone!
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,Oh no. Nightmare Moon!
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,mayor mare,Seize her! Only she knows where the Princess is!
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,applejack,Ergh...
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,rainbow dash,Come back here! [pants] Nighttime? Forever? Where's she going?
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,spike,Uh... We gotta stop Nightmare!...
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,"You've been up all night, Spike. You are a baby dragon after all. Elements, elements, elements... Ugh! How can I stop Nightmare Moon without the Elements of Harmony?"
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,rainbow dash,"And just what are the Elements of Harmony? And how did you know about Nightmare Moon, huh? Are you a spy? Whoa!"
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,applejack,"Simmer down, Sally. She ain't no spy. But she sure knows what's going on. Don't you, Twilight?"
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,"I read all about the prediction of Nightmare Moon. Some mysterious objects called the Elements of Harmony are the only things that can stop her, but I don't know what they are, where to find them; I don't even know what they do!"
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,pinkie pie,"""The Elements of Harmony: A Reference Guide."""
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,How did you find that?!
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,pinkie pie,"[sing-song voice] It was under ""E""!"
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,"Oh. There are six Elements of Harmony, but only five are known: Kindness, Laughter, Generosity, Honesty and Loyalty. The sixth is a complete mystery. It is said, the last known location of the five elements was in the ancient castle of the royal pony sisters. It is located in what is now--"
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,pinkie pie,Whee! Let's go!
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,"Not so fast. Look, I appreciate the offer, but I'd really rather do this on my own."
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,applejack,"No can do, sugarcube. We sure ain't lettin' any friend of ours go into that creepy place alone. We're stickin' to you like caramel on a candy apple."
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,pinkie pie,Especially if there's candy apples in there. What? Those things are good.
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,"So, none of you have been in here before?"
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,rarity,"Ugh, heavens no! Just look at it - it's dreadful."
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,applejack,And it ain't natural. Folks say it don't work the same as Equestria.
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,What's that supposed to mean?
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,rainbow dash,Nopony knows. You know why?
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,applejack,"Rainbow, quit it."
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,rainbow dash,'cause everypony who's ever come in has never come out!
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,rainbow dash,Fluttershy! Quick!
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,fluttershy,"Oh my goodness, oh my goodness."
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,applejack,Hold on! I'm a-comin'!
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,Applejack! What do I do?
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,applejack,Let go.
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,Are you crazy?
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,applejack,No I ain't. I promise you'll be safe.
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,That's not true!
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,applejack,"Now listen here. What I'm sayin' to you is the honest truth. Let go, and you'll be safe."
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,Yaaah! Phew-wah!
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,fluttershy,Sorry girls. I'm not used to holding anything more than a bunny or two.
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,rainbow dash,"And once Pinkie and Rarity were saved, whoosh... Me and Fluttershy loop-de-loop around and WHAM! Caught you right in the nick of time."
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,"Yes, Rainbow, I was there, and I'm very grateful, but we gotta- [gasp] A manticore!"
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,We've gotta get past him!
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,rarity,"Take that, you ruffian!"
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,rarity,My hair! Woop--
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,fluttershy,Wait.
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,applejack,"YEE-HAW! Git along, little dogie."
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,fluttershy,Wait.
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,applejack,"Whoa! All yours, partner."
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,rainbow dash,I'm on it.
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,fluttershy,Wait!
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,Rainbow!
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,fluttershy,WAIT!
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,fluttershy,"Shhh... It's okay. Oh, you poor, poor little baby."
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,rainbow dash,Little?
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,fluttershy,Now this might hurt for just a second.
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,fluttershy,"[giggles] Aw you're just a little ol' baby kitty, aren't you? Yes you are, yes you are."
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,How did you know about the thorn?
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,fluttershy,I didn't. Sometimes we all just need to be shown a little kindness.
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,rarity,"No. My eyes need a rest from all this icky muck. Well, I didn't mean that literally."
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,That ancient ruin could be right in front of our faces and we wouldn't even know it.
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,rarity,"I didn't see you there, my apologies."
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,rainbow dash,Right here... guh...
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,applejack,"Oh wait, I think I stepped in somethin'."
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,applejack,It's just mud.
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,applejack,Aah!
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,"Pinkie, what are you doing?! Run!"
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,pinkie pie,"Oh girls, don't you see?"
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,pinkie pie,When I was a little filly and the sun was going down...
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,Tell me she's not...
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,pinkie pie,"The darkness and the shadows, they would always make me frown..."
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,rarity,She is.
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,pinkie pie,I'd hide under my pillow From what I thought I saw But Granny Pie said that wasn't the way To deal with fears at all
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,rainbow dash,Then what is?
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,pinkie pie,"She said, ""Pinkie, you gotta stand up tall Learn to face your fears You'll see that they can't hurt you Just laugh to make them disappear."""
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,pinkie pie,"So, giggle at the ghostly Guffaw at the grossly Crack up at the creepy Whoop it up with the weepy Chortle at the kooky Snortle at the spooky"
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,pinkie pie,How are we gonna cross this?
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,pinkie pie,Huh?
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,"Excuse me, sir. Why are you crying?"
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,rainbow dash,"Oh, give me a break."
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,applejack,That's what all the fuss is about?
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,rarity,"Why, of course it is. How can you be so insensitive? Oh, just look at him. Such lovely luminescent scales."
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,rarity,And your expertly coiffed mane.
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,rarity,Your fabulous manicure.
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,rarity,All ruined without your beautiful mustache.
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,rarity,I simply cannot let such a crime against fabulosity go uncorrected.
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,"Rarity, what are you-"
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,rarity,You look smashing.
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,"Oh, Rarity, your beautiful tail..."
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,rarity,"Oh. It's fine, my dear. Short tails are in this season. Besides, it'll grow back."
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,rainbow dash,So would the mustache.
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,[gasp] We can cross now. Let's go. Ah!
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,"There it is, the ruin that holds The Elements of Harmony. We made it!"
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,applejack,"Twilight, wait for us!"
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,We're almost there. Whoa!
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,rainbow dash,What's with you and falling off cliffs today?
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,pinkie pie,[sighs] Now what?
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,rainbow dash,Duh.
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,pinkie pie,Oh yeah.
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,rainbow dash,Who's there?
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,rainbow dash,I ain't scared of you! Show yourself!
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,rainbow dash,Who?
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,rainbow dash,"Really?! I mean... Oh yeah, me. Hey, uh, you wouldn't mind telling the Wonderbolts that, would ya? 'cause I've been trying to get into that group for like, ever."
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,rainbow dash,Yep.
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,rainbow dash,Yes.
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,rainbow dash,"Yes, [chuckle] it's all true."
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,rainbow dash,WOOHOO! Sign me up. Just let me tie this bridge real quick and then we have a deal.
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,"Rainbow, what's taking so long? Oh no. Rainbow! Don't listen to them."
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,rainbow dash,"You... Thank you! For the offer, I mean, but I'm afraid I have to say no."
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,rainbow dash,See? I'd never leave my friends hangin'.
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,Whoa.
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,applejack,"Come on, Twilight. Isn't this what you've been waitin' for?"
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,"The Elements of Harmony, we've found them. Careful, careful!"
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,pinkie pie,"One, two, three, four... There's only five!"
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,rainbow dash,Where's the sixth?
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,"The book said: when the five are present, a spark will cause the sixth Element to be revealed."
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,applejack,What in the hay is that supposed to mean?
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,"I'm not sure, but I have an idea. Stand back. I don't know what will happen."
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,applejack,"Come on now, y'all. She needs to concentrate."
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,Aah!
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,The Elements!
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,applejack,"Twilight, where are you?"
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,rarity,Look!
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,applejack,Come on!
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,[gasp] Hmph!
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,nightmare moon,"You're kidding. You're kidding, right?"
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,"[groan] Just one spark. Come on, come on. Aah!"
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,nightmare moon,"No, no!"
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,[gasp] But... where's the sixth Element?!
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,"[gasp] You think you can destroy The Elements of Harmony just like that? Well, you're wrong, because the spirits of The Elements of Harmony are right here."
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,nightmare moon,What?
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,"Applejack, who reassured me when I was in doubt, represents the spirit of... honesty! Fluttershy, who tamed the manticore with her compassion, represents the spirit of... kindness! Pinkie Pie, who banished fear by giggling in the face of danger, represents the spirit of... laughter! Rarity, who calmed a sorrowful serpent with a meaningful gift represents the spirit of... generosity! And Rainbow Dash, who could not abandon her friends for her own heart's desire represents the spirit of... loyalty! The spirits of these five ponies got us through every challenge you threw at us."
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,nightmare moon,You still don't have the sixth Element! The spark didn't work!
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,"But it did! A different kind of spark. I felt it the very moment I realized how happy I was to hear you, to see you, how much I cared about you. The spark ignited inside me when I realized that you all... are my friends! You see, Nightmare Moon, when those Elements are ignited by the... the spark, that resides in the heart of us all, it creates the sixth element: the element of... magic!"
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,nightmare moon,Nooo! Nooo!
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,rainbow dash,"Ugh, my head."
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,applejack,Everypony okay?
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,rarity,"Oh, thank goodness."
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,fluttershy,"Why Rarity, it's so lovely."
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,rarity,I know! I'll never part with it again.
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,fluttershy,No. Your necklace. It looks just like your cutie mark.
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,rarity,What? Ooh. So does yours.
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,pinkie pie,Look at mine! Look at mine!
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,rainbow dash,Aw yeah.
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,applejack,"Gee, Twilight! I thought you were just spoutin' a lot of hooey, but I reckon we really do represent the elements of friendship."
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,princess celestia,Indeed you do.
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,[gasps] Princess Celestia.
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,princess celestia,"Twilight Sparkle, my faithful student. I knew you could do it."
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,But... you told me it was all an old pony tale.
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,princess celestia,"I told you that you needed to make some friends, nothing more. I saw the signs of Nightmare Moon's return, and I knew it was you who had the magic inside to defeat her, but you could not unleash it until you let true friendship into your heart. Now if only another will as well. Princess Luna!"
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,princess celestia,"It has been a thousand years since I have seen you like this. Time to put our differences behind us. We were meant to rule together, little sister."
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,princess celestia,Will you accept my friendship?
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,pinkie pie,Whoa!
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,princess luna,"I'm so sorry! I missed you so much, big sister!"
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,princess celestia,"I've missed you, too."
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,pinkie pie,"[blows her nose] [sobs] Hey, you know what this calls for?"
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,pinkie pie,A party!
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,princess celestia,"Why so glum, my faithful student? Are you not happy that your quest is complete and you can return to your studies in Canterlot?"
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,"That's just it. Just when I learned how wonderful it is to have friends, I have to leave them."
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,princess celestia,"Spike, take a note, please. I, Princess Celestia, hereby decree that the unicorn Twilight Sparkle shall take on a new mission for Equestria. She must continue to study the magic of friendship. She must report to me her findings from her new home in Ponyville."
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,"Oh thank you, Princess Celestia! I'll study harder than ever before."
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Lauren Faust,pinkie pie,"Isn't this exciting? Are you excited cause I'm excited I've never been so excited, well, except for the time that I went [deep gasp] but I mean really-"
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,"No problem at all, Applejack. I'm glad the goal is lunchtime. All this hard work is making me hungry."
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,spike,"I know, right?"
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,"Ooh-wee, Spike. You've been lounging on my back all morning while we worked."
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,spike,"Exactly. You two are taking so long, I missed snack-time."
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,"[stomach grumbles] [laughs nervously] Eh, I guess we better get some food."
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,spike,Nope. Worm. A-ha!
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,"Oh Spike, that looks delicious."
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,Spike.
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,It's a letter from Princess Celestia.
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,spike,"[clears throat] Hear ye, hear ye. Her Grand Royal Highness, Princess Celestia of Equestria, is pleased to announce the Grand Galloping Gala to be held in the magnificent capital city of Canterlot, on the 21st day of, eh, yadda yadda yadda, cordially extends an invitation to Twilight Sparkle plus one guest."
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,applejack,Woo-hoo!
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,spike,"[burp] Look, two tickets."
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,"Wow, great! I've never been to the gala. Have you, Spike?"
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,spike,"No, and I plan to keep it that way. I don't want any of that girly frilly frou-frou nonsense."
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,"Aw, come on Spike. A dance would be nice."
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,applejack,"Nice? It's a heap good more than just nice. I'd love to go. Land sakes, if I had an apple stand set up, ponies would be chowin' our tasty vittles 'til the cows came home. Do you have any idea how much business I could drum up for Sweet Apple Acres? Why, with all that money, we could do a heap of fixin' up 'round here. We could replace that saggy old roof, and Big McIntosh could replace that saggy old plow, and Granny Smith could replace that saggy old hip."
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,applejack,"Why, I'd give my left hind leg to go to that gala."
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,"Oh, well in that case, would you like to--"
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,rainbow dash,Whoa! [crash] Ugh. Are we talking about the Grand Galloping Gala?
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,applejack,Rainbow Dash. You told me you were too busy to help me harvest apples. What were you busy doing? Spyin'?
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,rainbow dash,"No, I was busy napping, and I just happened to hear that you have an extra ticket?"
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,"Yeah, but--"
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,rainbow dash,"YES! This is so awesome. The Wonderbolts perform at the Grand Galloping Gala every year. I can see it now. Everyone would be watching the sky. Their eyes riveted on the Wonderbolts, but then in would fly Rainbow Dash!"
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,rainbow dash,I would draw their attention with my Super Speed Strut.
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,rainbow dash,"Then, I would mesmerize 'em with my Fantastic Filly Flash. And for my grand finale, the Buccaneer Blaze! The ponies would go wild!"
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,rainbow dash,"The Wonderbolts would insist that my signature moves be incorporated into their routine, and then welcome me as their newest member."
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,applejack,Hold on just one pony pickin' minute here. [spit] I asked for that ticket first.
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,rainbow dash,So? That doesn't mean you own it.
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,applejack,"Oh, yeah? Well I challenge you to a hoof-wrestle. Winner gets the ticket."
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,"Girls, these are my tickets, I'll decide who gets it, thank you very much. Whoever has the best reason to go should get the ticket, don't you think?"
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,applejack,Drummin' up business for the farm?
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,rainbow dash,A chance to audition for the Wonderbolts?
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,applejack,Money t' fix Granny's hip.
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,rainbow dash,Living the dream.
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,"Oh my, those were all pretty good reasons, aren't they? [stomach rumbles] [chuckles] Listen to that, I am starving. I don't know about you, but I can't make important decisions on an empty stomach, so I'll, uh, think about it over lunch and get back to you two, okay?"
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,spike,"So, who you gonna give the ticket to, Twilight?"
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,"I don't know Spike, but I really can't think straight when I'm hungry, so where should we eat?"
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,pinkie pie,"[crash] Gah! Bats! Bats on my face! Help! Wait, these aren't... tickets to the Grand Galloping Gala?! It's the most amazing incredible tremendous super-fun wonderful terrifically humongous party in all of Equestria! I've always always always wanted to go!"
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,pinkie pie,Oh the Grand Galloping Gala is the best place for me Oh the Grand Galloping Gala is the best place for me Hip hip Hooray! It's the best place for me For Pinkie...
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,pinkie pie,With decorations like streamers and fairy-lights and pinwheels and pi<f1>atas and pin-cushions. With goodies like sugar cubes and sugar canes and sundaes and sun-beams and sarsaparilla. And I get to play my favorite-est of favorite fantabulous games like Pin the Tail on the Pony!
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,pinkie pie,Oh the Grand Galloping Gala is the best place for me Oh the Grand Galloping Gala is the best place for me 'Cause it's the most galarrific superly-terrific gala ever In the whole galaxy Wheee!!
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,pinkie pie,"Oh thank you, Twilight, it's the most wonderful-est gift ever."
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,"Um, actually--"
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,rarity,[gasp] Are these what I think they are?
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,Uh--
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,pinkie pie,"Yes, yes, yes! Twilight's taking me to the Grand Galloping Gala in Canterlot."
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,rarity,"The gala? I design ensembles for the gala every year, but I've never had the opportunity to attend. Oh, the society, the culture, the glamour! It's where I truly belong, and where I'm destined to meet him."
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,pinkie pie,Him! ... Who?
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,rarity,"Him. I would stroll through the gala, and everyone would wonder, ""Who is that mysterious mare?"" They would never guess that I was just a simple pony from little old Ponyville. Why, I would cause such a sensation that I would be invited for an audience with Princess Celestia herself, and the princess would be so taken with the style and elegance that she would introduce me to him, her nephew: the most handsome, eligible unicorn stallion in Canterlot. Our eyes would meet, our hearts would melt. Our courtship would be magnificent. He would ask for my hoof in marriage, and of course I would say, ""Yes!"" We would have a royal wedding, befitting a princess, which is [giggles] what I would become upon marrying him, the stallion of my dreams."
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,rarity,"Twilight, I simply cannot believe you would invite Pinkie Pie so she can... party, and prevent me from meeting my true love. How could you? Hmph."
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,spike,Hey!
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,fluttershy,"[gasp] Angel, these are perfect."
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,"Uh, listen guys, I haven't decided who to give the extra ticket to."
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,fluttershy,"Um, excuse me, Twilight. I would just like to ask, I mean, if it would be all right, if you haven't given it to someone else--"
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,rarity,You? You want to go to the gala?
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,fluttershy,"Oh, no. I mean, yes, or, actually, kind of. You see, it's not so much the Grand Galloping Gala as it is the wondrous private gated garden that surrounds the dance. The flowers are said to be the most beautiful and fragrant in all of Equestria. For the night of the gala, and that night alone, would they all be in bloom... and that's just the flora! Don't get me started on the fauna. There's loons and toucans and bitterns, oh my! Hummingbirds that can really hum, and buzzards that can really buzz. White-blue jays, and red jays, and green jays, pink jays and pink flamingos!"
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,"Gee, Fluttershy, it sounds... beautiful...?"
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,rainbow dash,Wait just a minute.
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,Rainbow Dash! Were you following me?
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,rainbow dash,"No. I mean, yes. I mean, maybe. Look, it doesn't matter. I couldn't risk a goody-four-shoes like you giving that ticket away to just anybody."
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,applejack,Wait just another minute.
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,"Applejack, were you following me too?"
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,applejack,No. I was followin' this one to make sure she didn't try any funny business. Still trying to take mah ticket.
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,rainbow dash,Your ticket?
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,pinkie pie,But Twilight's taking me.
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,QUIET!
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,pinkie pie,"And then I said, ""Oatmeal, are you craz--"" oh."
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,"Girls, there's no use in arguing."
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,rarity,But Twilight-
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,"Eh! This is my decision, and I'm gonna make it on my own, and I certainly can't think straight with all this noise... [stomach rumbles] not to mention hunger. Now go on, shoo."
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,"And don't worry, I'll figure this out... somehow."
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,I CAN'T DECIDE!
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,spike,"Twilight, he just wants to take your order."
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,Oh. I would love a daffodil and daisy sandwich.
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,spike,"Do you have any rubies? No? Okay. I'll have the hay fries, extra crispy."
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,"What do you think, Spike?"
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,spike,"I think we have to try another restaurant. I mean, I like grass just fine, but would it hurt anybody to offer some gemstones?"
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,I mean about the Gala and the ticket and who I should take.
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,spike,Oh. You're still on that?
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,"Spike, listen. How do I choose? And when I do choose, will the other four be mad at me? I mean, I could give up my ticket and give away two, but that would still leave three disappointed ponies. What if I--"
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,Oh thank you. This looks so good. I'm sure everything will be much clearer once I eat.
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,It's not raining... What's going on?
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,rainbow dash,"Hi there, best friend forever I've ever ever had. Enjoying the sunny weather?"
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,"Rainbow Dash, what are you doing?"
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,rainbow dash,"Whaddya mean? I just saw the smartest, most generous pony about to get rained on, so I thought I'd kick a hole in the clouds to keep her dry so she could dine in peace, that's all."
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,"Rainbow, you're not trying to get extra consideration for the extra ticket by doing me extra special favors, are you?"
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,rainbow dash,"Me? No no no, of course not."
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,Uh-huh.
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,rainbow dash,"Seriously, I'd do it for anypony. [gulp] Heh heh, eh."
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,"Rainbow, I am not comfortable accepting unwanted favors, so I'd appreciate it if you close up that rain cloud right now."
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,rarity,"Twilight, it's raining."
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,"No, really?"
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,rarity,Come with me before you catch a cold.
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,"Heh heh, oops, sorry."
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,rarity,"Oh no, it's quite all right. After all, we are... the best of friends, are we not? And you know what the best of friends do?"
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,Uh...
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,rarity,Makeovers!
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,"Ugh, Rarity, ow, this really isn't fixing it. I mean, thank you but, ooh, that's too tight."
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,rarity,"There. Oh, you're simply darling."
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,"Uh, yeah, it is kinda pretty, isn't it?"
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,rarity,"And you. Oh Spike, I have a dandy little outfit for the dashing gent."
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,spike,"D-ah, ow, oh, hey, wow, watch it, whoa!"
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,"[giggles] Oh, Spike."
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,rarity,Now you just need a hat.
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,spike,"Ugh, I told you, I don't want any part of this girly gala gunk. See you back at the library."
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,rarity,"[laughs] Oh, who needs him anyway. This is all about you, and how fabulous you'll look at the Grand Galloping Gala."
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,"Wait, the Grand--"
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,rarity,"[gasp] And oh, my goodness, what a coincidence. I happen to have an ensemble of my own that matches yours to a T. We would be the belles of the ball, you and I. Everyone would be clamoring for our attention. All eyes would be on us, and then everyone would finally know, the most beautiful, most talented, most sophisticated pony in all of Equestria is Rarity the unicorn. Ah, [nervous laughter] and Twilight Sparkle, of course."
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,"I see what's going on. You're just buttering me up so I give you the extra ticket. Well it's not gonna work. You're going to have to wait for my decision just like everyone else. Now if you'll excuse me, I've been trying all day just to get some lunch."
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,applejack,Did somepony say lunch?
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,You've got to be kidding me!
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,applejack,"I got apple pie, apple fritters, apple tarts, apple dumplings, apple crisps, apple crumblers, and apple Brown Betty. Uh, the dessert, not my auntie. What do you say there, best friend?"
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,applejack,Is that a yes?
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,"No. No. I don't know who I'm giving the ticket to, and all these favors aren't making it any easier to decide. In fact, I'm less sure now than I was this morning. Ugh!"
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,applejack,"So, that's a maybe?"
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,"Ugh, I never thought being showered with favors would be so aggravating."
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,"[gasp] Fluttershy, not you too?"
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,fluttershy,"Oh, well, hello Twilight. I hope you don't mind, but we're all doing a little spring cleaning for you."
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,It's summer.
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,fluttershy,"Oh, well, better late than never, right? It was Angel's idea."
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,"You're not doing this for the ticket, are you?"
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,fluttershy,"Oh no, I'm doing this because you're my very best friend. Right, Angel? Oh, yes, we are just doing this for the ticket."
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,"No, no, no! Well, this was all very nice of you and Angel, but I'm not accepting any extra favors until I've made my final decision, so I'm going to have to ask you to leave."
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,pinkie pie,"Twilight is my bestest friend Whoopie, whoopie!"
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,Pinkie...
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,pinkie pie,"She's the cutest, smartest, all around best pony, pony!"
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,Pinkie.
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,pinkie pie,"I bet if I throw a super-duper fun party, party!"
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,Pinkie!
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,pinkie pie,She'll give her extra ticket to the Gala to me!
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,PIIINKIIIE!!
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,pinkie pie,"Yes, Twilight?"
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,At least the other ponies tried to be subtle about the ticket.
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,pinkie pie,"Oh, you didn't know? Twilight has an extra ticket to the Grand Galloping Gala!"
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,spike,What are we gonna do?
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,We're... gonna... run!
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,spike,Ugh... Warn me next time you're gonna do that.
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,"I didn't even know it was gonna happen. Now quick, lock the doors. Yaaaargh! I can't decide, I just can't decide. It's important to all of you and I just can't stand to disappoint any of you, and giving me gifts and doing me favors won't make any difference, because you're all my friends and I wanna make you all happy and I can't, I just can't!"
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,applejack,"Twilight, sugar, I didn't mean to put so much pressure on you, and if it helps, I don't want the ticket anymore. You can give it to somepony else. I won't feel bad, I promise."
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,fluttershy,Me too. I feel just awful that I made you feel so awful.
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,pinkie pie,And me too. It's no fun upsetting your friends.
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,rarity,"Twilight, it was unfair of me to try to force you as I did."
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,rainbow dash,"Yes! That means the ticket is mine. Ha ha, [sing-song voice] I got the ticket, I got the ticket-- you know, I haven't perfected my signature moves for the Wonderbolts anyway. I don't need that ticket either."
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,applejack,We all got so gun-ho about going to the gala that we couldn't see how un-gun-ho we were making you.
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,"Spike, take down a note. Dear Princess Celestia,"
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,"I've learned that one of the joys of friendship is sharing your blessings, but when there's not enough blessings to go around, having more than your friends can make you feel pretty awful. So, though I appreciate the invitation, I will be returning both tickets to the Grand Galloping Gala."
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,"If my friends can't all go, I don't wanna go either."
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,applejack,"Twilight, you don't have to do that."
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,"Nope. I've made up my mind. Spike, you can send the letter now."
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,fluttershy,Now you won't get to go to the gala either.
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,"It's okay, girls. I couldn't possibly enjoy myself without my best friends there with me, so I would rather not go at all."
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,spike,Hgh... hgh... urk... urk...
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,applejack,"Well wallop my withers, Spike. Isn't that just like a boy? Can't handle the least bit of sentiment."
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,applejack,Whoa Nelly!
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,A letter from the princess? That was fast.
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,spike,"""My faithful student Twilight,"
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,twilight sparkle,Now we can all go.
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,rarity,Allow us to treat you to dinner.
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,rainbow dash,What a great way to apologize.
The Ticket Master,Amy Keating Rogers & Lauren Faust,pinkie pie,"And to celebrate. Come on everyone, the cupcakes are on me."
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,Boy howdy! I got my work cut out for me. That there is the biggest bumper crop o' apples I ever laid eyes on.
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,big mcintosh,Eeyup. Too big for you to handle on your own.
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"Come on, big brother! You need to rest up and get yourself better. I haven't met an apple orchard yet that I can't handle. Oops, sorry. I'll take a bite out of this job by day's end."
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,big mcintosh,Biting off more than you can chew is just what I'm afraid of.
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,Are you sayin' my mouth is makin' promises my legs can't keep?
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,big mcintosh,Eeyup.
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"Why of all the... This is your sister Applejack, remember? The loyalest of friends and the most dependable of ponies?"
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,big mcintosh,"But still only one pony, and one pony plus hundreds o' apple trees just doesn't add up to..."
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,Well I better get kickin'. These apples aren't gonna shake themselves outta the trees. Hey! Oh no.
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,STAMPEDE!
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,sweetie drops,Stampede!
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,[laughter] Hey...! [vibrating] This makes my voice sound silly!
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"Pinkie Pie, are you crazy?! Run!"
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,mayor mare,Everypony calm down. There is no need to panic.
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,"But Mayor, whatever shall we do?"
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,Look there!
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,YEEHAW!
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"Move aside, Winona. Put 'em up, girl!"
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,Attagirl. [grunts] Yee haw!
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,Whoaaa. Hooie. Now what was that all about?
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"I completely understand. Just next time, try and steer clear of Ponyville."
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,Yee haw!
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"Yee haw! Ride 'em, cowpony!"
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,mayor mare,Applejack was just... just...
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,Appletastic!
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,mayor mare,Exactly. We must do something to thank Applejack for single-hoofedly saving the town.
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,I know.
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,A party!
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,We all ready?
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,Just one last thing. Now we're ready.
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,Is Applejack all set?
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,"Actually, I haven't seen her all week."
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,Not since the stampede.
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,But she'll be here for sure. Applejack is never late.
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"Welcome, everypony! Today we are here to honor a pony we can always count on to help in matters great and small. A pony whose contributions to--"
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,"Did you see Applejack's slick moves out there? What an athlete. This week she's gonna help me with my new flying trick, and I know it's gonna be so awesome."
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,Exactly. And...
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"This week, I get to run Sugarcube Corner for the first time."
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,What does that have to do with Applejack?
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"Oh. Applejack, one of the best bakers ever, is gonna help me. Applejack makes everything great, so free samples for everypony!"
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"Oh-kay, that's great. Now if I could just make a point without being inter--"
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,fluttershy,Twilight?
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,--rupted.
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,fluttershy,"Twilight, I'm so sorry, but I just wanted to mention that Applejack is also helping me this week with the official bunny census, where we count up all the new baby bunnies that were born this season. She's gonna help gather them using her wonderful herding skills."
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"Anyone else? Anyone? No? Well then, as I was trying to say... Urgh! Never mind."
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,mayor mare,"Ah-ahem. And so, with no further ado, it is my privilege to give the prize, Pony of Ponyville Award, to our beloved guest of honor, a pony of the utmost trustworthiness, reliability, and integrity. Ponyville's most capable and dependable friend: Applejack!"
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,spike,"Cool! Way to go Applejack, that was awesome! I mean-- heh."
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,mayor mare,Ah-ahem.
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,spike,Awkward.
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"I'm here. I'm here. [yawn] [sigh] Sorry I'm late--whoa--I was just... whoa... Did I get your tail? Miss Mayor. Thank you kindly for this here... award thingy. [yawn] It's so bright and shiny and, heh, heh heh, I sure do look funny heh. Ooo-ooo."
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,Woo-ooo.
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,Ooo-ooo.
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"Okay. Well, thank you Applejack for saving us from that scary stampede, and always being there for everypony."
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"[yawn] Yeah. I like helping the ponyfolks and [yawn] and stuff. [snore] Oh, uh, yeah. Uh, Thanks."
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"Was it just me, or did Applejack seem a little--"
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,Tired?
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,fluttershy,Dizzy?
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,"Messy? Well, did you see her mane?"
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,She seemed fine to me. Woo! Woo!
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,Hmm.
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,[grunts] [sigh] Phew. [gasp] O-oah.
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,What on Earth is that pony doing?
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,Whoops.
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,Hey Applejack!
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,Applejack.
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,Applejack. AppleJACK!
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"Oh, howdy, Twilight."
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,What is all this?
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,It's Applebuck season. Whoa.
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,Applewhat season?
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"Neh, It's what the Apple family calls harvestin' time. We gather all the apples from the trees so we can sell 'em."
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,But why are you doing it all alone?
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,'cause Big McIntosh hurt himself.
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,What about all those relatives I've met when I first came to Ponyville? Can't they help?
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"[sigh] They were just here for the Apple family reunion. They actually live all over Equestria and are busy harvestin' their own orchards. So, uh, I'm on my own. Which means, I should really get back to work. Ahem... hint hint? Get back to work?"
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,Fine.
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"Could you step aside, Twilight?"
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"I just did. Applejack, you don't look so good."
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"Eh, don't any of you three worry none, I'm just fine and dandy. Whoa."
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,Do you... want some help?
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"Help? No way, no how."
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,But there's no way you can do it all on your own.
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,Is that a challenge?
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,Uhm... no?
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"Well, I'm gonna prove to you that I can do it! Now if you'll excuse me, I've got apples to buck."
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,There you are.
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"[yawn] I'm a mite sorry, Rainbow. I was busy applebuckin' and I guess ah, I closed my eyes for a second and, when I woke up, I was late. Now, what's this new trick a' yours?"
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,See this contraption?
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,Uh... Yeah.
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,"Well, I'm gonna stand on one end, then you're gonna jump down from that platform, launching me into the air faster than I can take off on my own. Once I'm in the air, I'm gonna do some amazing flips and spins that are sure to impress the Wonderbolts."
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,Isn't that a mite dangerous?
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,"Pfft, Heh, not for a pony who can fly."
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"Well, all right-y then. Oh my."
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,Ready? One... two... THREE!
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,Umm... maybe I wasn't clear. You're supposed to land on the other end.
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,"Applejack, what the hay is going on? I mean, I thought I was working with Ponyville's best athlete!"
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"You are. I'm okay. Really. I-I have an idea. Watch this. [groan] Ta da! Oh... Maybe not. Okay, one more try. I'm sure to get it this time."
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,Ugh!
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,Heh heh... Here I go!
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,"Wait, Applejaaaaack!"
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,You're welcome!
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,Can I help you?
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,I think somepony else needs your help.
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,Applejack?
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,Yep.
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,Ow!
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"Applejack, can we talk? Applejack, can we talk?"
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,Can bees squawk?! I don't think so.
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,No. Can we talk?
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,Twenty stalks? Bean or celery?
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,No! I need to talk to you.
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"You need to walk to the zoo? Well, who's stoppin' you?"
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,I need to talk to you!
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,Oh! Well why didn't you say so? What you wanna talk about?
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,Rainbow Dash dropped in to see me today.
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,That's quite neighborly of her.
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"Yes, except that she crashed onto my balcony after you launched her into the air."
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"Oh, yeah. I wasn't feeling quite myself this morning."
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,Because you're working too hard and you need help.
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,What? Kelp? I don't need kelp. I don't even like seaweed.
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,HELP! You need HELP!
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"Nothin' doin', Twilight. I'm gonna prove to you, t'everypony, that I can do this on my own. Ow! Now if you'll excuse me, I've gotta go help Pinkie Pie."
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,Ugh.
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,mrs. cake,"Mrs. Now Pinkie Pie, are you sure you're up for baking the muffins and running the store this afternoon?"
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"Yes siree bob, Mrs. Cake. Plus, I have Ponyville's prized pony to help me out. Why, she's the best baker ever. Right, Applejack?"
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,mr. cake,Mr. No? You're not the best baker ever?
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"WHAT? Oh no! I mean, don't you fret. I can bake anything from fritters to pies in the blink of an eye."
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,mrs. cake,"Mrs. [sigh] All right. Well, see you later, girls!"
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"Stop with the shakin', it's time to get bakin'."
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,All right-y! I'll get the sugar and the eggs. Can you get me some chocolate chips?
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"Eh, uh, whu, what was that?"
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,Chocolate chips.
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"Chips... got it. Tater chips, a little salty and dry, okie-dokie. What next?"
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,Baking soda.
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,Soda. Perfect. That'll get the tater chips nice and wet. Now what?
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,A cup of flour.
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"A cup o' sour? Well, lemons are sure sour. One cup o' sour, comin' up. Anything else, Pinkie?"
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,One last thing. Wheat germ.
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"Wheat worms? Oh, that must be fancy talk for earthworms."
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,Now that's gonna be delicious.
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,If you say so.
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,Free muffin sample spectacular!
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,Yeah! Muffin spectacles! Get 'em while they're hot.
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,We came as soon as we heard.
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,Oh no! What happened?
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,Applejack.
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,spike,[chomp] Want one?
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"Applejack, we need to talk."
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"Wha, huh? Oh, it's you, Twilight. [yawn] I know what you're gonna say, but the answer is still no."
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"Not to upset your applecart, but you need help."
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,Hardy har. [groan] And no I don't.
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"Here, let me help."
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,Help? No thanks. [groan] A little more... [groan] Little... [grunt] There. I'll prove that this apple can handle these apples. Come on [grunt] apples [grunt] fall off [grunt].
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"AJ, think you're beating a dead... tree."
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,I knew that.
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"Actually, Applejack, I had something else to talk to you about. I just came back from Ponyville Urgent Care and--"
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"You know, I'm a little busy to get lectured right now, Twilight."
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,But if you'd just let me help--
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"Ugh. No, no, NO! How many times do I gotta say it? I don't need no help from nopony!"
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,Ugh. That pony is stubborn as a mule.
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,No offense.
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,fluttershy,Oh Applejack! Thank you so much for offering your herding skills for the annual rabbit roundup.
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,Ugh. Why are we doin' this?
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,fluttershy,"Well, lots of new baby bunnies have been born, so it's my job to get a count of all the new families."
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,Fine. Can we just get on with it?
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,fluttershy,"Certainly, but remember, these are bunnies we're dealing with, not cows. They're a timid bunch and need to be treated gently."
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"I do NOT need any direction on corrallin' critters. Right, Winona?"
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,fluttershy,"Okay, little bunnies! I need you to all gather here in the middle."
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"That's right! Let's go, bunnies. In the center. Hop to it. Swell. Just swell. Put 'em up, Winona!"
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,fluttershy,Applejack! Winona! Stop! You're scaring them.
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"We know what we're doin'. Get along, little bunnies."
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,fluttershy,Oh no.
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,STAMPEDE!
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,I don't get it.
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,fluttershy,"Oh my. Oh... Please stop, little bunnies. Oh no! Please, let's go home. Oh my goodness."
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,All right. Enough is enough.
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,Must [gasp] keep [gasp] buckin'... just [gasp] a few [gasp] more. Must finish harvestin'.
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"All right, Applejack. Your applebucking hasn't just caused you problems, it's over-propelled Pegasus', practically poisoned plenty of ponies, and terrorized bushels of brand new bouncing baby bunnies. I don't care what you say, you. Need. Help."
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"[grunts] Ha! No, I don't. Look, I did it. I harvested the entire Sweet Apple Acres without your help. How d'ya like them apples?"
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,big mcintosh,"Um, how do you like them apples?"
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,Applejack. Applejack.
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,Huh?
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"Oh, good, you're okay. Now Applejack, I completely respect the Apple family ways. You're always there to help anypony in need, so maybe you can put a little of your stubborn pride aside and allow your friends to help you."
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"Okay, Twilight."
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"I am not taking ""no"" for an answer--what?"
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"Yes, Twilight. Yes, please. I could really use your help."
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"Dear Princess Celestia,"
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"My friend Applejack is the best friend a pony could ever have, and she's always there to help anypony. The only trouble is, when she needs help, she finds it hard to accept it, so while friendship is about giving of ourselves to friends, it's also about accepting what our friends have to offer."
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"How about y'all take a little break? I got some fine apple juice waitin' for ya! [sigh] Girls, I can't thank you enough for this help. I was acting a bit stubborn."
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,A bit?
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"Okay. A mite stubborn, and I'm awful sorry. Now, I know the town gave me the Prized Pony award, but the real award is having you five as my friends."
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,Phew! That applebucking sure made me hungry.
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,spike,And I've got the perfect treat.
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"Eeew... Spike, I threw those all away. Where'd you get them?"
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,spike,From the trash.
Applebuck Season,Amy Keating Rogers,spike,Just a little nibble? Come on.
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,pinkie pie,"Hoof-biting action overload! She was like a stunt superstar, flying higher and higher, and then Rainbow Dash swooped down--swoosh--and right before she hit the ground--shoom-she pulled up--vrrrmmm!"
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,Uh-huh.
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,pinkie pie,And then she looped around and around like whoo whoo whoo whoo whoo whoo whoo!
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,Uh-huh. Phew.
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,pinkie pie,Rainbow Dash!
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,[grunt] Pinkie Pie? Not again.
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,pinkie pie,Rainbow Dash.
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,"Not now, Pinkie Pie."
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,pinkie pie,"But, but Rainbow Dash<U+0096>"
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,I'm in the middle of something.
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,pinkie pie,But<U+0096>
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,pinkie pie,I was gonna tell you to look out for that mountain.
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,pinkie pie,"[humming] Hi, I'm looking for Rainbow Dash. Have you seen her? Hi there, have you seen Rainbow Dash? Okay, thanks anyway. Twilight, have you seen Rainbow Dash anywhere?"
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,Isn't she right up there?
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,pinkie pie,Rainbow Dash.
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,Phew. That was close.
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,pinkie pie,Hi!
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,Aah!
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,pinkie pie,Hi again.
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,Aah!
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,pinkie pie,"Pfeh. I need a favor, Rainbow Dash."
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,"Waaa--oh, forget it."
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,pinkie pie,I totally promise it'll be totally fun.
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,[sighs] Okay.
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,pinkie pie,"Over to the right. No no, a little to the left. Oh wait, back to the right. Now a little leftish while staying rightly. Stop. Hmm. Maybe a few inches to the south. Now a couple centimeters north. Okay. One more smidgimeter to the--"
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,Pinkie Pie!
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,pinkie pie,"Uh, I mean, perfect. Now wait for my signal."
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,pinkie pie,"[laughing] Oh Rainbow Dash, we startled Spike into getting the hiccups."
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,spike,"[chuckles] Good one, Pinkie [hiccup] Pie. [hiccup] You're always pulling a fast one [hiccup] on me. [hiccup] Nnaa--"
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,pinkie pie,"Oh no, you're not hurt are you?"
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,spike,"Ne--[hiccup]--eh, don't be [hiccup] silly, dragons are [hiccup] fire-proof."
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,pinkie pie,"Oh, okay, good."
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,spike,I wish the same thing [hiccup] were true with scrolls.
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,I can think of one thing.
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,"I didn't take you for a prankster, Pinkie Pie."
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,"You know Pinkie Pie, you're not as annoying as I thought."
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,You wanna hang out?
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,A simple nod would do.
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,pinkie pie,Mmm-hmm.
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,Is she even home?
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,pinkie pie,I don't know. This is gonna be gold.
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,There she is.
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,pinkie pie,Aaa-choo!
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,Hmm?
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,applejack,[gasp] Land sakes!
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,pinkie pie,Is someone over there? Who're we gonna squirt? Who're we gonna squirt?
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,[chuckles] Fluttershy.
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,pinkie pie,"WHAT? [spits] Nononononono, we can't prank Fluttershy, I mean, she's so sensitive. It'll hurt her feelings, even our most harmless prank."
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,"Yeah, you're right. [raspberry] Huh. We need another victim who's made of tougher stuff. So, who's it gonna be?"
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,pinkie pie,"Oh, [chuckles] I've got someone in mind. [chuckles] The toughest around."
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,"Oh, awesome. Who? Who? Do I know them?"
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,pinkie pie,"[giggles] Oh, yes. [giggles] You're very close."
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,"[chuckles] Good one, Pinkie Pie."
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,Ridiculous.
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,pinkie pie,[blows party hooter] Rise and shine Rainbow Dash! It's a brand new day and we got a lot of pranking to-- Ooh.
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,"Mornin', Pinks. Gilda, this is my gal pal, Pinkie Pie."
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,gilda,Hey. What's up?
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,"Pinkie, this is my griffon friend, Gilda."
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,pinkie pie,What's a griffon?
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,"She's half-eagle, half-lion."
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,gilda,"And all awesome. Raa. Heh-haa. Yeah, that's right."
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,"Gilda's my best friend from my days at Junior Speedster flight camp. Hey, remember the chant?"
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,gilda,"Sha, they made us recite it every morning, I'll never get that lame thing out of my head."
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,Sooo...
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,gilda,"Ugh. Only for you, Dash."
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,pinkie pie,"[laughs] Oh that was awesome, and it gave me a great idea for a prank. Gilda, you game?"
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,gilda,"Huh. Well, I groove on a good prank as much as the next griffon. But Dash, you promised me we'd get a flying session in this morning."
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,"Yeah, uh, well, Pinkie Pie, you don't mind, do you? Gilda just got here. We'll catch up with you later."
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,gilda,"Whoa, that was sweet. Just like old times."
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,"Yeah, only faster. So now what?"
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,pinkie pie,Hey there.
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,pinkie pie,It's later. And I caught up.
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,"Pinkie Pie, you are so random."
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,gilda,"Hey Dash, think you got enough gas left to beat me to that cloud?"
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,A race? You are so on.
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,gilda,"One, two, three, go."
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,pinkie pie,Hey!
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,I win.
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,gilda,"As if. I won, dude."
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,No way.
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,gilda,Yes way.
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,"Oh, come on, I was way ahead of you."
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,gilda,"Uh, I don't think so."
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,"Oh Geez, dream on."
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,gilda,Remember back in camp? I<U+0096>
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,There is no way you beat me.
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,gilda,Whatever.
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,pinkie pie,"Wow guys, that was really close, but I think Rainbow Dash beat you by a teeny weeny itty bitty hair, or a teeny weeny itty bitty feather."
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,"Hah, see? Good thing Pinkie Pie's here to keep you honest, G."
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,gilda,"Okay... Dash, last one to that cloud up there is a gnarly dragon egg. Go! [To Pinkie Pie] I think the high altitude is making you dizzy."
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,pinkie pie,"Wait, guys! Oh wow, you guys almost got away from me that time."
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,gilda,"So, Dash, got any new moves in your tricktionary, or are you 100% old school?"
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,"New moves? Heh, sit back G, this is gonna take a while."
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,gilda,"Hey Pinkie, c'mere."
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,pinkie pie,Yeah?
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,gilda,"Don't you know how to take get lost for an answer? Dash doesn't need to hang with a dweeb like you now that I'm around. You're dorkin' up the skies, Stinkie Pie, so make like a bee and BUZZ OFF."
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,pinkie pie,[gasp] Whaaa-aaa<U+0096>
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,"Try matching that. Hey, where's Pinkie Pie and her crazy contraption?"
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,gilda,"Eh, she left. Something about being as busy as a bee."
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,pinkie pie,Hmph!
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,"So Pinkie Pie, are you sure that this friend of Rainbow Dash is really so mean?"
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,pinkie pie,"Um, yeah. She keeps stealing Rainbow Dash away, she pops my balloons, and she told me to buzz off. I've never met a griffon this mean. Well, actually, I've never met a griffon at all, but I bet if I had, she wouldn't have been as mean and grumpy as Gilda."
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,"You know what I think, Pinkie Pie."
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,pinkie pie,Hmm?
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,"Well, I think... you're jealous."
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,pinkie pie,Jealous?
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,spike,"Green with envy. Well, in your case, pink with envy."
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,"Well, yes. Jealous. Listen Pinkie, I don't want to upset you, but just because Rainbow Dash has another friend doesn't make Gilda a grump. I mean, perhaps it's you, Pinkie, who needs to improve her attitude."
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,"[laughing] That was sweet. Ugh, I gotta take care of a few weather jobs around here. Shouldn't take long. Just, uh, hang out in town and I'll come find ya."
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,gilda,"That's cool, I guess. I'm gonna go chow down."
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,Later.
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,granny smith,"[sniffs] Aaah! A rattler, a rattler! Run for the hills! Everybody forsake yourselves!"
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,gilda,"This stuff ain't fresh, dude."
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,pinkie pie,"Aw, poor Granny Smith, she didn't know it was a joke. How mean. No, no, I can't misjudge her. It was kind of a funny prank, I guess."
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,pinkie pie,"[gasp] I did misjudge her. She's not only a meanie mean-pants, she's also a thief. Nonononono, she might give it back. It's just a joke."
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,fluttershy,"All right little ones, this way, this way. Mama duck, you're free and clear."
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,gilda,Hey.
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,fluttershy,Please excuse me.
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,gilda,I'm walkin' here.
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,fluttershy,"Oh, um, I'm sorry. I-I-I was just trying to..."
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,gilda,"[mocking] I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Why don't you just watch where you're going, doofus?"
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,fluttershy,B-b-b-but I... I...
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,gilda,"Ugh, please, all these lame ponies are driving me buggy. I gotta bail."
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,pinkie pie,"She's a grump, and a thief, and a bully. The meanest kind of mean meanie-pants there is. I can take it, but no one treats Fluttershy like that. No. One. This calls for extreme measures, Pinkie Pie style."
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,pinkie pie,"Welcome, welcome. Welcome!"
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,applejack,Who's this Gilda I've heard nothing about?
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,rarity,"I hear she's an old friend of Rainbow Dash. A griffon, so rare."
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,"You've met Gilda, right? What's she like?"
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,fluttershy,"Oh, um, well, I'll tell you later, Twilight."
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,pinkie pie,Welcome. Welcome.
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,fluttershy,"Um, Pinkie Pie, about this party for Gilda. Umm... Do you really think it's a good idea? I mean<U+0096>"
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,pinkie pie,Don't worry your pretty little head about mean old Gilda. Your auntie Pinkie Pie's got it all taken care of.
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,fluttershy,I'm a year older than you.
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,pinkie pie,"Gilda! I'm so honored to throw you one of my signature Pinkie Pie parties, and I really, truly, sincerely, hope you feel welcome here amongst all us pony folk."
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,"Oh Pinkie Pie, the old hoof-shake buzzer. You are a scream."
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,gilda,"Yeah [chuckles nervously] uh, good one, Pinkie Pie."
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,"Come on G, I'll introduce you to some of my other friends."
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,gilda,Right behind you Dash. I know what you're up to.
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,pinkie pie,Great.
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,gilda,Rrrh. I know what you're planning.
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,pinkie pie,"[giggles] Well, I hope so. This wasn't supposed to be a surprise party."
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,gilda,"I mean, I've got my eye on you."
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,pinkie pie,"And I got my eye on you. Everyone, I'd like you all to meet Gilda, a long-time, dear friend of Rainbow Dash. Let's honor her and welcome her to Ponyville."
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,pinkie pie,Please help yourself.
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,gilda,Vanilla lemon drops. Don't mind if I do. HOT!
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,"G, the punch."
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,gilda,[gasp] [gulp] Huh?
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,pinkie pie,"Well, whaddya know, pepper in the vanilla lemon drops, and the punch served in a dribble glass."
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,gilda,"[gulp] [gasp] Yeah, hilarious."
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,"Hey G, look, presents."
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,applejack,"Spittin' snakes. Hah, somepony pulled that prank on me last month."
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,gilda,Ha ha. I bet I know who that was.
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,pinkie pie,You do?
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,pinkie pie,Cake time everypony.
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,spike,"Hey, can I blow out the candles?"
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,"Why don't we let Gilda blow out the candles, Spike? She is the guest of honor after all."
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,spike,Ugh.
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,spike,"[laughs] Re-lighting birthday candles, I love that prank. What a classic."
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,pinkie pie,"Now, I wonder who could've done that."
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,gilda,"Yeah, I wonder."
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,spike,"Mmm, who cares. This cake is amazing."
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,Spike.
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,spike,"What? It's great, try some."
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,"Hey G, you're not upset about some silly candles, are you?"
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,gilda,"No way, Dash. Like I said, I'm down with a good prank."
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,"Come on then, let's have some cake."
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,gilda,"Hey, I'm watching you. Like a hawk."
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,pinkie pie,Why? Can't you watch me like a griffon?
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,applejack,"Hey y'all, it's pin the tail on the pony. Let's play."
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,rarity,"Oh, my favorite game. Can I go first? Can I have the purple tail?"
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,gilda,"Well, I am the guest of honor, and I'll have the purple tail."
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,pinkie pie,"Yeah, Gilda should definitely go first. Let's get you blindfolded."
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,gilda,Hey what-- ugh-- what are you doing? Rrrah.
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,pinkie pie,We're spinning you around and around and then you can pin the tail on the pony. Now just walk straight ahead and pin the tail.
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,gilda,"[mockingly] Now just walk straight ahead and pin the tail. Hmph, yeah, right. This is another prank, isn't it? I'm going this way."
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,pinkie pie,Wait. The poster is this--
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,pinkie pie,"Uh, Gilda? You pinned the tail on the wrong end."
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,gilda,"[roar] This is your idea of a good time? I've never met a lamer bunch of dweebs in all my life. And Pinkie Pie, you! You are queen lame-o with your weak little party pranks. Did you really think you could make me lose my cool? Well, Dash and I have ten times as much cool as the rest of you put together. Come on Dash, we're bailing on this pathetic scene. Come on Rainbow Dash. I said, we're leaving."
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,"You know Gilda, I was the one who set up all those weak pranks at this party."
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,gilda,[gasp] What?
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,pinkie pie,Ooh.
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,So I guess I'm queen lame-o.
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,gilda,"Come on, Dash, you're joshing me."
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,"They weren't all meant for you specifically, it was just dumb luck that you set them all off."
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,pinkie pie,"I shoulda known, that dribble cup had Rainbow Dash written all over it."
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,gilda,"No way. It was Pinkie Pie. She set up this party to trip me up, to make a fool of me."
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,pinkie pie,Me? I threw this party to improve your attitude. I thought a good party might turn that frown upside down.
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,"And you sure didn't need any help making a fool of yourself. You know, this is not how I thought my old friends would treat my new friends. If being cool is all you care about, maybe you should go find some new cool friends someplace else."
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,Not cool.
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,spike,"Wow, talk about a party pooper."
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,"Wow, what was that about?"
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,"I'm sorry everypony, for bringing Gilda here. I didn't know how rude she was. And Pinkie Pie, I'm really sorry she ruined that awesome party you put on for her."
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,pinkie pie,"Hey, if you want to hang out with party poopers, that's your business."
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,I'd rather hang out with you. No hard feelings?
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,pinkie pie,No hard feelings.
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,Hey Pinkie. Sorry I accused you of misjudging Gilda. Looks like I'm the one who misjudged you.
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,pinkie pie,"It's okay Twilight, even you can't be a super smart smarty smart-pants all the time. Come on everypony, there's still a whole lotta party to finish."
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,"Dearest Princess Celestia,"
Griffon the Brush Off,Cindy Morrow,princess celestia,"Dear Twilight Sparkle,"
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,spike,"Come on, Twilight. You can do it!"
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,twilight sparkle,"Okay, here goes."
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,twilight sparkle,"Sorry, Romeo. As attractive and enticing as you look, it's just for practice, and it's gotta go."
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,spike,"Wait! Aw, rats!"
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,spike,"Twenty-five, Twilight. Twenty-five different kinds of tricks and counting. I thought unicorns were only supposed to have a little magic that matches their special talents!"
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,twilight sparkle,"True, for ponies whose talents are for things like cooking or singing or math. But what if a unicorn's special talent is magic?"
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,spike,"Like you, Twilight, and you know a ton of magic."
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,twilight sparkle,"Oh, Spike, stop. I'm sure there are lots of ponies right here in Ponyville that know just as much magic as me."
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,spike,"Are you kiddin'? I don't think there's another unicorn in all of Equestria with your kind of ability, Twilight."
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,snails,Gangway! Comin' through!
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,spike,"Augh! Snips, Snails! What's goin' on?"
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,snails,"Wha, haven't you heard?"
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,spike,Whoa!
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,snails,There's a new unicorn in town!
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,snips,Yeah! They say that she's got more magical powers than any other unicorn ever!
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,twilight sparkle,Really?
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,spike,"Aw, no way, that honor goes to Twilight here."
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,twilight sparkle,Where is this unicorn?
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,snails,"Ho, she's in the town square. Come on!"
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,snips,Yeah! [laughter] Come on! Whooo!
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,trixie,"Come one, come all! Come and witness the amazing magic of the Great and Powerful Trixie!"
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,trixie,Watch in awe as the Great and Powerful Trixie performs the most spectacular feats of magic ever witnessed by pony eyes!
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,rarity,"My, my, my! What boasting!"
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,spike,"Come on, nopony's as magical as Twi<U+0097> Twi<U+0097> Twi<U+0097> Oh! [clears throat] Hey, Rarity, I, uh<U+0097> Mustache!"
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,twilight sparkle,"There's nothing wrong with being talented, is there?"
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,applejack,"Nothin' at all, 'cep'n when someone goes around showin' it off like a school filly with fancy new ribbons."
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,rarity,Just because one has the ability to perform lots of magic does not make one better than the rest of us.
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,rainbow dash,"Especially when ya got me around being better than the rest of us. [laughter] Eh, I mean, yeah, uh, magic shmagic. Boo!"
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,trixie,"Well, well, well, it seems we have some neighsayers in the audience. Who is so ignorant as to challenge the magical ability of the Great and Powerful Trixie? Do they not know that they're in the presence of the most magical unicorn in all of Equestria?"
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,rarity,[raspberry] Just who does she think she is?
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,spike,Yeah! Since we all know that Twilight here is<U+0097>
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,twilight sparkle,Spike! Shhh!
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,spike,What? What's wrong?
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,twilight sparkle,You see the way they reacted to Trixie? I don't want anyone thinking I'm a show-off.
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,rainbow dash,"So, ""Great and Powerful Trixie"". What makes you think you're so awesome, anyway?"
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,trixie,"Heh, why, only the Great and Powerful Trixie has magic strong enough to vanquish the dreaded ursa major!"
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,snips,What?
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,snails,No way!
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,trixie,"When all hope was lost, the ponies of Hoofington had no one to turn to, but the Great and Powerful Trixie stepped in, and with her awesome magic, vanquished the ursa major and sent it back to its cave deep within the Everfree Forest!"
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,snips,That settles it.
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,snails,"Trixie truly is the most talented, the most magical, the most awesome unicorn in Ponyville."
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,snips,"No, in all of Equestria!"
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,spike,"How do you know? You didn't see it! And besides, Twi<U+0097> [zip!] Mmph! M-mmph!"
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,trixie,"[laughter] It's true, my enthusiastic little admirers. Trixie is most certainly the best in Ponyville."
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,trixie,"Don't believe the Great and Powerful Trixie? [chuckles] Well then, I hereby challenge you, Ponyvillians. Anything you can do, I can do better. Any takers? Anyone? Hmm? Or is Trixie destined to be the greatest equine who has ever lived!?"
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,twilight sparkle,"There's no way I'm going to use my magic now, Spike. Especially since<U+0097>"
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,trixie,"Hmm, how about you?"
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,trixie,"Well, how about it? Hm? Is there anything you can do that the Great and Powerful Trixie can't?"
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,twilight sparkle,I<U+0097> I<U+0097>
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,trixie,"Well, little hayseed?"
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,applejack,That's it! I can't stand for no more of this!
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,spike,"You show her, AJ!"
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,applejack,Can your magical powers do this?
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,applejack,"Top that, missy."
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,trixie,Oh ye of little talent. Watch and be amazed at the magic of Trixie!
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,applejack,Whoa! Uh!
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,trixie,"Once again, the Great and Powerful Trixie prevails."
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,rainbow dash,There's no need to go struttin' around and showin' off like that.
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,trixie,Oh?
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,rainbow dash,That's my job!
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,rainbow dash,"They don't call me ""Rainbow"" and ""Dash"" for nothin'!"
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,trixie,"When Trixie is through, the only thing they'll call you is loser."
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,rainbow dash,Whoa! Whoa! Whoa-a-a-a! [gulp] I think I'm [gulp] gonna be sick.
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,trixie,Seems like anypony with a dash of good sense would think twice before tussling with the Great Trixie.
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,rainbow dash,Ow!
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,spike,What we need is another unicorn to challenge her. Someone with some magic of her own.
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,rainbow dash,Yeah! A unicorn to show this unicorn who's boss.
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,applejack,A real unicorn to unicorn tussle.
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,twilight sparkle,Uh...
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,rarity,"Enough. Enough, all of you. I take your hint, but Rarity is above such nonsense. Rainbow Dash and Applejack may behave like ruffians, but Rarity conducts herself with beauty and grace."
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,trixie,"Ooo, what's the matter? Afraid you'll get a hair out of place in that rat's nest you call a mane?"
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,rarity,"Oh, it. Is. On! You may think you're tough with all of your so-called powers, but there's more to magic than your brutish ways. A unicorn needs to be more than just muscle. A unicorn needs to have style."
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,rarity,A unicorn is not a unicorn without grace and beauty.
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,spike,"Rarity won't let Trixie get the best of her! She's strong, she's beautiful, she's<U+0097>"
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,rarity,Quick! I need a mirror! Get me a mirror! What did she do to my hair? I know she did something terrible to my hair!
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,twilight sparkle,Nothing.
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,rainbow dash,It's fine.
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,applejack,It's gorgeous.
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,spike,It's green. What?
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,spike,"Well Twilight, guess it's up to you. Come on, show her what you're made of."
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,twilight sparkle,What do you mean? I'm nothing special.
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,spike,"Yes, you are! You're better than her!"
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,twilight sparkle,I'm not better than anyone.
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,trixie,"Hah! You think you're better than the Great and Powerful Trixie? You think you have more magical talent? Well, come on, show Trixie what you've got. Show us all."
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,twilight sparkle,"Who, me? I'm just your run-of-the-mill citizen of Ponyville. No powerful magic here. I, uh... I think I hear my laundry calling. Sorry, gotta go."
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,spike,Twilight?
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,trixie,"Ha! Once again, the Great and Powerful Trixie has proven herself to be the most amazing unicorn in all of Equestria. Huh, was there ever any doubt?"
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,snips,"Here's your smoothie you asked for, with extra hay, just how you like it."
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,snails,"Mmm, hay."
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,trixie,[sips] Yes?
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,snips,"Ooo, tell us another story, Great and Powerful Trixie."
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,snails,"Yeah, tell us about how you vanquished the ursa major."
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,trixie,Guh! Trixie is far too exhausted from performing feats beyond imagination. Begone with you until morning.
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,snails,"Oh, of course, Great and Powerful Trixie."
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,snips,Anything you say. We are at your beck and call.
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,trixie,Ah.
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,spike,What are you two doin'?
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,snips,Just bringin' the Gee an' Pee Tee a<U+0097>
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,spike,The what?
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,snips,The Great and Powerful Trixie.
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,spike,Sheesh.
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,snips,Just bringin' her a smoothie.
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,spike,"How can you fall for her lameness? She's just a show-off. Unlike Twilight, who<U+0097>"
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,snips,The Great and Powerful Trixie vanquished an ursa major. Can your Twilight claim that?
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,spike,Oh really? Were you guys actually there?
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,snips,"Well, eh, uh... no, but<U+0097>"
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,spike,But nothin'. The proof is in the pudding.
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,snails,[laughs] I like pudding.
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,spike,"Look, unless an ursa major comes waltzing up the street for Trixie to vanquish, I am not gonna believe a word she says, and neither should you!"
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,snips,"Hm, an ursa walkin' up the street, hey? Snails! You thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?"
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,snails,Why is it they call it a flea market when they don't really sell fleas?
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,snips,"Yeah, uh... oh, come on!"
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,spike,"Twilight, would you put down that book and just listen to me?"
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,twilight sparkle,"Didn't you see how they hated Trixie's bragging, Spike? If I go out there and show off my magic, I run the risk of losing them as friends."
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,spike,"It's not the same thing, Twilight. You'll be using your magic to stand up for your friends!"
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,twilight sparkle,"No, Spike, it's exactly the same."
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,spike,"Come on, Twilight, any one of these tricks, even the teeniest, would be enough to show up Trixie."
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,twilight sparkle,I don't want to be seen as a bragger like Trixie.
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,spike,But you're the best!
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,twilight sparkle,"Uh. Please, Spike, I said no!"
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,spike,"[sighs] If that's the way you want to be, then fine."
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,snips,"Oh, how we gonna find an ursa major when I can't even see my own hoof in front of my face?"
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,snips,"Oh, heh. That's better."
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,snails,Yaaaah!
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,snips,Yaaaah!
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,spike,"Hey, guys, where ya goin'?"
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,snips,Can't talk now.
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,snails,Got a major problem!
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,snips,"Yeah, ursa major, to be exact."
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,spike,Huh?
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,spike,Twilight!
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,trixie,Trixie thought she said the Great and Powerful Trixie did not want to be disturbed!
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,snips,[nervous laughter] We<U+0097> We have a<U+0097> a tiny problem.
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,snails,"Actually, it's a big one."
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,trixie,What is so important that you cannot wait until morning to disturb Trixie?
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,spike,Twilight! You've gotta come! Quick!
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,twilight sparkle,"I already told you, Spike, I don't wanna show up Trixie!"
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,spike,"No, you don't understand, it's<U+0097>"
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,twilight sparkle,"Uh, is that what I think it is?"
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,spike,Majorly.
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,snips,"Great and Powerful Trixie, you've got to vanquish the ursa."
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,snails,"Yeah, vanquish so we can watch."
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,snips,It took a lot of trouble to get that thing here.
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,trixie,"Wait, you brought this here? [gasp] Are you out of your little pony minds?"
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,snips,"But, you're the Great and Powerful Trixie."
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,snails,"Yeah, remember? You defeated an ursa major."
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,trixie,"Uh, okay. [gulp] Stand back."
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,trixie,Heh. Piece of cake.
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,snips,"Aw, come on, Trixie."
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,snails,"Stop goofin' around and vanquish it, eh?"
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,snails,"Well, that was a dud."
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,snips,"Yeah, pfft, come on! Where's all the cool explosions and smoke and stuff like earlier? You know."
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,trixie,Uh-oh.
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,twilight sparkle,What's going on?
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,snips,We brought an ursa to town.
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,twilight sparkle,You what!?!
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,snails,"Don't worry, the Great and Powerful Trixie will vanquish it."
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,trixie,I can't.
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,trixie,"Oh, I can't, I never have. No one can vanquish an ursa major. I just made the whole story up to make me look better."
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,spike,Nice use of number sixteen.
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,spike,That's new.
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,rainbow dash,Unbelievable!
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,spike,That was amazing!
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,applejack,"Heavens to Betsy! We knew you had ability, but not that much!"
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,twilight sparkle,"I'm sorry. Please, please don't hate me."
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,rarity,"Why, whatever do you mean, darling?"
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,twilight sparkle,"Well, I know how much you all hated Trixie's showing off with her magic tricks, and I just thought--"
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,rainbow dash,"Whoa, whoa, whoa. Magic's got nothing to do with it. Trixie's just a loudmouth."
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,rarity,Most unpleasant.
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,applejack,All hat and no cattle.
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,twilight sparkle,"So, you don't mind my magic tricks?"
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,applejack,"Your magic is a part of who you are, sugarcube, and we like who you are. We're proud to have such a powerful, talented unicorn as our friend."
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,rainbow dash,"And after whuppin' that ursa's hindquarters, we're even prouder."
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,twilight sparkle,You are?
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,rainbow dash,Uh-huh.
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,applejack,Mm-hmm.
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,rarity,Mm-hmm.
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,spike,"Wow, Twilight, how'd you know what to do with that ursa major?"
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,twilight sparkle,That's what I was doing when you came looking for me. I was so intrigued by Trixie's bragging that I was compelled to do a little reading up on them.
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,spike,So it is possible to vanquish an ursa major all by yourself?
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,twilight sparkle,"That wasn't an ursa major. It was a baby, an ursa minor."
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,trixie,That was just a baby?
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,twilight sparkle,And it wasn't rampaging. It was just cranky because someone woke it up.
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,spike,"Well, if that was an ursa minor, then what's an ursa major like?"
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,twilight sparkle,You don't wanna know.
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,trixie,"Huh. You may have vanquished an ursa minor, but you will never have the amazing, show-stopping ability of the Great and Powerful Trixie!"
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,rainbow dash,"Why, that little..."
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,twilight sparkle,"Just let her go. Maybe someday she'll learn her lesson. Now, about you two."
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,snips,"Ah [nervous laughter]. Uh, we're sorry that we woke up the ursa minor."
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,snails,We just wanted to see some awesome magic.
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,snips,Yeah! And the way you vanquished that ursa minor was awesome!
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,snails,We deserve whatever punishment you give us.
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,twilight sparkle,"For starters, you can clean up this mess. And... What do you think, Spike? Should I give them number twenty five?"
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,spike,"Oh, twenty five! Yes! And I think I deserve it, too."
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,twilight sparkle,I think you're right.
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,twilight sparkle,"Dear Princess Celestia,"
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,twilight sparkle,"I have learned a very valuable lesson about friendship: I was so afraid of being thought of as a show-off that I was hiding a part of who I am. My friends helped me realize that it's okay to be proud of your talents, and there are times when it's appropriate to show them off... Especially when you're standing up for your friends."
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,spike,"So, you finally admit that you're the most talented unicorn in all of Ponyville?"
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,twilight sparkle,"Well, yeah, but it's nothing to brag about. So, uh, how did it go with Rarity?"
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,spike,"Eh, she didn't go for the mustache."
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,twilight sparkle,"You know, Spike, that mustache has nothing to do with who you really are. Maybe you should just try being yourself."
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,spike,Or... Maybe the mustache wasn't enough. Maybe if I had a mustache and a beard?
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,twilight sparkle,"Uh, not this again!"
Boast Busters,Chris Savino,spike,"Okay, imagine me with a nice, long, Fu Manchu type beard. Or maybe a goatee. Oh, no, a soul patch right on my chin!"
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,"Oh, goodness. Are you okay?"
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,Are you coughing because there's a carrot stuck in your throat?
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,Because you need some water?
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,[gasp] Because of that giant cloud of scary black smoke? I'll take that as a... yes.
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,"Don't be such a scaredy-pony. It's just me, future Equestria ball-bouncing record holder. Three forty six, three forty seven..."
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,This calls for a celebration!
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,"Oh, no, Pinkie Pie, this is no time for celebration. This is a time for panic, for--"
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,Ooo! I'm going to need balloons! One for every pony in Ponyville!
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,"There's-- there's smoke. And-- and where there's smoke, there's fire. And--"
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,"Let's see, that's one, two, three, four..."
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,Three hundred fifty four...
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,"Five, six..."
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,"Three hundred fifty five, no, wait..."
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,Seven.
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,Pinkie Pie! Now I have to start over.
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,"We're all going to have to start over, in a new village. 'Cause ours is gonna be--"
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,"Hey, Rainbow Dash, wait up!"
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,"Oh, please, this is an emergency. I-I need everypony to--"
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Listen up! Smoke is spreading over all of Equestria.
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,That's what I've been trying to--
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"But don't worry, I've just received a letter from Princess Celestia informing me that it is not coming from a fire."
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,"Oh, thank goodness."
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,It's coming from a dragon.
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,A... d-dragon?
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,applejack,What in the name of all things cinnamon swirled is a full-grown dragon doing here in Equestria?
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Sleeping.
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"According to Princess Celestia, he's taking a nap. His snoring is what's causing all this smoke."
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,He should really see a doctor. That doesn't sound healthy at all.
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"Well, at least he's not snoring fire. What are we meant to do about it?"
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,I'll tell you what we're meant to do. Give him the boot. Take that. And that!
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"We need to encourage him to take a nap somewhere else. Princess Celestia has given us this mission, and we must not fail. If we do, Equestria will be covered in smoke for the next one hundred years."
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,Hmph. Talk about getting your beauty sleep.
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"All right everypony, I need you to gather supplies quickly. We've got a long journey ahead of us. Let's meet back here in less than an hour."
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,"Okay, girls, you heard her. The fate of Equestria is in our hooves. Do we have what it takes?"
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,"Um, actually..."
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,Raaah!
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,applejack,Yaaa!
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,"[laughter] Oh, I mean, grrr!"
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,Ewww! Much better. Onward!
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,applejack,Let's go!
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"All right girls, listen up. I'm mapping out the fastest route, but we've all got to keep a good pace if we expect to make it up the mountain by nightfall."
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,M-m-mountain?
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,The dragon is in that cave at the very top.
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,applejack,Looks pretty cold up there.
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,"You bet it is. The higher you go, the chillier it gets."
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,Good thing I brought my scarf.
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,Ooo! Pretty!
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,"Heh, oh yeah. That'll keep you nice and cozy."
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,"[gulp] Um, excuse me, Twilight? I know you're busy, but..."
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"Uh-huh. Well, we could go this way."
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,But if I could just have a second...
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"Uh-huh. No, we want to avoid that."
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,"So, um, I was thinking that, um, maybe I should just stay here in Ponyville."
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Uh-huh.
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,Oh! Good. I'll stay here and--
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Wait! You have to come! Your way with wild animals will surely come in handy.
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,I don't think I--
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"Oh, and don't worry about your little friends in the meadow. Spike's got it covered while you're gone."
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,spike,You can count on me! Oooh! Hey! Hey! Wait!
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,I don't really think he's up to the task. Maybe... But... But... no!
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,"Are you sure you want Fluttershy to come along? I mean, that pony's afraid of her own shadow. She's just going to slow us down."
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"Oh, she's just a little nervous. Once we get going, I'm sure she'll be fine."
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"All right girls, move out!"
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,Whoa. What was that?
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,That is what it sounds like when a dragon snores.
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,It-- it's so... high!
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,"Well, it is a mountain. I'm going to fly up there and check it out! Wah!"
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,applejack,"Hold on, now. I think we should all go up together. Safety in numbers and all."
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,"Oh, all right."
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"I hear the only thing that sparkles more than a dragon's scales are the jewels they use to build their nests. Ooo, if I play my cards right, I might be able to convince him to part with a few!"
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"Girls! This is no laughing matter! Fluttershy, you're the expert on wild creatures. What do you think the dragon will be like? Fluttershy?"
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,Hey! What are you waiting for? An invitation?
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,"Ooo, I think I have one in my bag!"
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,I-it's so... so... steep.
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,"Well, it is a cliff. You could just, oh, I don't know, fly up here?"
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,"Come on, Fluttershy, you can do it. Flap those wings!"
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,Ugh.
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"Uh, we don't have time for this. What are you doing?"
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,applejack,I'll need this if I'm going to take her around the mountain another way.
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,[groan] Around the mountain? That's going to take them forever.
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,applejack,"Don't worry, Twi. We'll be there lickety-split."
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,Whoo-hoo! I win again!
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,Ugh. That's thirty-five games in a row. Best of seventy-one?
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,Told you it was going to take them forever.
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"Your turn, Fluttershy."
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,But... it's so... wide.
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"Come on, Fluttershy, we should be much farther along by now."
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,applejack,You could just leap on over.
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,I--
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,I don't know.
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,"There's nothing to be afraid of. It's just a hop, skip and a jump. See?"
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,"It's not very far Just move your little rump You can make it if you try with a hop, skip and jump"
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,We don't have time for this.
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,"A hop, skip and jump, Just move your little rump, A hop, skip and jump, A hop, skip and jump, A hop, skip and jump, A hop skip and jump, A hop skip and jump!"
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,O-okay. Here I go. A hop.
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,applejack,That's it.
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,You've got it.
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,Almost there.
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,Skip.
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Just don't look down.
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,Ugh.
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,I guess I forgot to jump.
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"[whispers] Let's keep it down. According to my map, we're entering an avalanche zone. The smallest peep could cause a huge rock slide."
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,An... an ava... ava...
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Shhh!
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,AVALA--!
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Oh no! Help! Ooh!
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,applejack,Oh my! [stops coughing] Everypony okay?
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Thanks to you I am.
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,Eugh. Blech.
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,Whoo-hoo! Let's do it again!
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"Uh! This is why a girl always packs extra accessories. Oh, please tell me I brought the tiara that goes with this."
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,"Uh, think we got bigger problems than making sure our hair bows match our horseshoes."
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,[sigh] Sorry.
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,applejack,"Aw, no big whoop, sugarcube."
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"Yeah, we'll just have to [sigh] climb over."
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,applejack,Wha! Wha...
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,My apologies.
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,Not your fault.
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,[sigh] Still think it was a good idea to bring Fluttershy along?
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"We're about to find out. We're here. Rainbow Dash, you'll use your wings to clear the smoke."
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,Mm-hmm.
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"Rarity and Pinkie Pie, you'll create a diversion to distract the dragon if things get a little hairy in there."
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"Applejack, you're ready with the apples in case he decides to attack. But it shouldn't come to that, because Fluttershy will do what she needs to do to wake him up, and between the two of us, we should be able to get him to understand why he needs to go. Is everypony ready?"
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"Okay then, we're goin' in. So, what is the best way to wake up a sleeping dragon without upsetting him? Fluttershy? Oh, come on! Come on! [grunt] We have to do this! [grunt] Now! Every [grunts] second longer that dragon [grunts] sleeps is another [grunts] acre of Equestria that is covered in [grunts] smoke. Ooh!"
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,I-- I-- I can't go in the cave.
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,"Oh, great. She's scared of caves now, too."
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,"I'm not scared of caves, I'm scared of [mumble]."
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,applejack,"What's that, sugarcube?"
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,I'm scared of [mumble].
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,What?
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,I'm scared of dragons!
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,But Fluttershy. You have a wonderful talent dealing with all kinds of animals.
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,"Yes, because they're not dragons."
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,Oh come on! We've seen you walk right up to a horrible manticore like it was nothing.
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,"Yes, because he wasn't a dragon."
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,Spike is a dragon. You're not scared of him.
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,"Yes, because he's not a huge, gigantic, terrifying, enormous, teeth-gnashing, sharp-scale having, horn-wearing, smoke-snoring, could eat a pony in one bite, totally all grown-up dragon!"
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"But, if you're so afraid of dragons, why didn't you say something before we came all the way up here?"
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,I was afraid to.
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,Ugh.
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,applejack,All of us are scared of that dragon.
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,I'm not!
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,applejack,"Almost all of us are scared of that dragon, but we've got a job to do. So, get in there with Twilight and show her what you're made of."
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,I-- I-- I just... can't.
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"Oh, Fluttershy."
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,I'm goin' in. He... probably just doesn't realize what he's doing... right?
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Mr. Dragon.
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Excuse me.
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Mr. Dragon.
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"Oh, good, you're awake. Please allow me to introduce myself. My name is Twilight--"
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"Augh! Puh! Sparkle, and my friends and I are residents here in Equestria. Ponyville, to be exact. We've come here to ask that you find another spot to take your nap. It's just that you seem to be doing an awful lot of snoring, and every time you do you send out a terrible cloud of smoke. [coughs] Equestria simply can't survive a hundred years in a dark haze. You understand, don't you?"
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,So much for [coughs] persuading him.
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,applejack,Now what?
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"[coughs] Obviously, this situation just calls for a little ""pony charm"". Allow me, girls. I'm so sorry to interrupt. [clears throat] But I couldn't possibly head back home without mentioning what handsome scales you have. And those scales have to be hidden away in some silly cave for a hundred years?"
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"Personally, I think you should skip the snoozing and be out there, showing them off. Hmm. Obviously, I would be more than happy to keep an eye on your jewels while you're gone."
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,I was this close to getting that diamond.
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,You mean... getting rid of that dragon?
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"Oh, yeah... sure."
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,applejack,What in tarnation...?
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"Darling, you look ridiculous."
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,Exactly! Sharing a laugh is a sure-fire way to get someone on your side! Hi!
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,"Apparently he doesn't like laughing, heh. Or sharing."
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,"All right, that's it. We tried persuasion, charm, whatever it is Pinkie Pie does."
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,It's time to stop wasting time! I'm going in!
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"Rainbow, no!"
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,Heh. Sorry.
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,Who-o-o-o-o-a!
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,"How dare you... How dare you! Listen here, mister. Just because you're big doesn't mean you get to be a bully! You may have huge teeth, and sharp scales, and snore smoke, and breathe fire. But you do not-- I repeat-- You do not! Hurt! My! Friends! You got that?"
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,Well?
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,"And I am very sorry about that. But you're bigger than she is, and you should know better. You should also know better than to take a nap where your snoring can become a health hazard to other creatures."
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,"Don't you 'but I' me, mister. Now what do you have to say for yourself? I said, what do you have to say for yourself?"
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,"There, there. No need to cry. You're not a bad dragon, you just made a bad decision. Now go pack your things. You just need to find a new place to sleep. That's all."
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,You did it! I knew you could do it.
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,spike,[pant] I said come back here! Ooh! How does Fluttershy put up with you furry little things?
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"Spike, take a letter."
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,spike,[sigh] With pleasure.
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"Dear Princess Celestia,"
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"I am happy to report that the dragon has departed our fair country, and that it was my good friend, Fluttershy, who convinced him to go. This adventure has taught me to never lose faith in your friends. They can be an amazing source of strength, and can help you overcome even your greatest fears."
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,applejack,Twilight! You gotta come see this! She's just five away from a new pony record!
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,"Three hundred forty-seven, three hundred forty-eight..."
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,Dragon!
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,[pants] Why are you laughing? That awful dragon is back!
Dragonshy,Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,"Pinkie Pie, you scared me! I mean, uh, you... broke my concentration."
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,rarity,Hmm. Hah! Perfect.
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,applejack,"[spit] Just take the broken limbs down, Rarity. Don't y'all care about nothin' other than prettifyin'?"
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,rarity,"Somepony has to. You were making an absolute mess of the town square, Applejack."
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,applejack,"Yeah, well, the storm's gonna make an even bigger mess if we don't prune all these loose branches so they don't tumble down on anypony."
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,rarity,I simply cannot imagine why the Pegasus ponies would schedule a dreadful downpour this evening and ruin what could have been a glorious sunny day.
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,applejack,"[sigh] Think more practical-like, will ya? They accidentally skipped a scheduled sprinkle last week, so we need a doozy of a downpour to make up for it, is all."
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,rarity,Oh no! My wonderfully styled mane shall be ruined!
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,applejack,Ya shoulda hurried up and finished the job already.
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,rarity,Oh! Ah! Oh! Ph! It's coming down too fast! Ah! Oh! Oh! Ah! Help me!
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,applejack,"Uh, there. Hunker down to yer heart's content whilst I finish things."
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,rarity,"[pant] Oh, no, no, no!"
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,applejack,What now?
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,rarity,I prefer not to get my hooves muddy.
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,applejack,"Guh. There is just no pleasin' ya, is there? Everything's got to be just so."
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,rarity,"[scoff] Well, and how does muddying my hooves serve any useful purpose?"
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,applejack,Y'all wouldn't know useful if it came up and bit'cha.
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,rarity,[laugh] That doesn't even make any sense.
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,applejack,Does so.
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,rarity,Does not.
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,applejack,Does so.
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,rarity,Does not.
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,applejack,Does so.
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,rarity,Does not.
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,applejack,Does so infinity. Hah.
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,rarity,Does not infinity plus one. Heh. What say we go our separate ways before one of us says something she will regret?
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,applejack,I reckon y'all are gonna say something you'll regret first.
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,rarity,"On the contrary, I believe it shall most certainly be you who says something you will regret first."
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,applejack,I'm not sayin' anythin'.
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,rarity,Nor am I.
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,applejack,"Y'all just be on yer way, then."
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,rarity,After you!
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,rarity,Perhaps we should stick together for now and find some shelter.
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,applejack,"Uh-huh, perhaps we should. And fast."
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,applejack,"Heh. Nice and dry under here, sorta."
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,rarity,Oh! Unacceptable.
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,twilight sparkle,Applejack! Rarity! Applejack! Rarity!
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,twilight sparkle,"Come inside girls, quick."
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,applejack,"Whoa, nelly. Is inside a tree really the best place to be in a lightning storm?"
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,twilight sparkle,It is if you have a magical lightning rod protecting your home like I do. Come on in!
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,rarity,Hah! We are most grateful for your invitation.
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,applejack,Thank ya kindly for yer hospitality.
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,rarity,"Uh, do be a polite house guest and go wash up please, won't you?"
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,applejack,"[grumble] If I gotta spend one more second with that fussbudget Rarity today, I can't be held responsible for what I'm gonna do."
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,twilight sparkle,"Some storm, huh? The Pegasus ponies sure have outdone themselves this time. I hope you and Applejack don't have any trouble getting home."
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,rarity,It may indeed be a problem.
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,twilight sparkle,"Well, you're welcome to stay if need be. Spike is away in Canterlot on royal business. I'm home all alone tonight. [gasp] You and Applejack should totally sleep over! We'll have a slumber party! I've always wanted one of those."
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,rarity,"Oh! Uh, goodness. Uh, I do believe I have another engagement scheduled for this evening that completely slipped my mind until just now. [nervous laugh] Ah, silly me, I can't possibly stay here all night -- with Applejack. [reading] Slumber 101: All You've Ever Wanted to Know About Slumber Parties But Were Afraid to Ask."
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,twilight sparkle,"My own personal copy. It's a fantastic reference guide. You should see the table of contents. I've been waiting for a chance to use it, and today is the day! This is gonna be so great!"
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,applejack,"[gasp] What in tarnation... Now wait just a goll-darn minute. Ya make me wash the mud off my hooves, but it's okay for y'all to have mud all over yer faces?"
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,rarity,Silly! This is called a mud mask. It's to refresh and rejuvenate your complexion.
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,twilight sparkle,"We're giving each other makeovers! Eee-hee! We have to do it, it says so in the book."
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,applejack,"Slumber 101: Everything You... Oh hey, heh, would'ja look at the time. I gotta skidaddle on home quick. I'm powerful late for, uh, fer somethin'. Uh, g'night. [cry] Or maybe I'll sit here for a spell."
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,twilight sparkle,Hurray slumber party!
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,applejack,Blahch. What in the world is this for?
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,rarity,"[sigh] To reduce the puffiness around one's eyes, of course."
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,twilight sparkle,"Hee-hee! Isn't this exciting? We'll do everything by the book, and that will make my slumber party officially fun."
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,rarity,"Did you hear that, Applejack? You certainly would not want to do anything that would ruin Twilight's very first slumber party, would you?"
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,applejack,"Of course not, 'n you wouldn't either, I reckon?"
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,rarity,So do we have an agreement?
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,rarity,"Oh! Gross! You know, there's messy and there's just plain rude."
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,applejack,"You know, there's fussy, 'n there's just plain gettin' on my nerves."
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,rarity,"Fortunately, I can get along with anypony, no matter how difficult she may be."
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,applejack,"Oh yeah? Well, I'm the ""get-alongin-est"" pony you're ever gonna meet."
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,rarity,That's not even a word.
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,twilight sparkle,This is going to be the bestest slumber party ever! Yay!
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,rarity,"So, how are you getting along over there, Applejack?"
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,applejack,"Just fine, Rarity."
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,twilight sparkle,"This is so awesome! [giggle] Makeovers, check. Ooh, it says here we have to tell ghost stories. Who wants to go first?"
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,applejack,Me! I'd like to tell y'all the terrifying tale of the prissy ghost who drove everypony crazy with her unnecessary neatness. Oo-oo! I'm sure y'all are familiar with that one?
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,rarity,"Never heard of it, but I have a much better one. It's the horrifying story of the messy, inconsiderate ghost who irritated everypony within a hundred miles! Oo-oo!"
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,applejack,That's not a real story. You made it up.
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,rarity,"It is a ghost story, they're all made up."
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,twilight sparkle,"I've got one! This story is called The Legend of The Headless Horse. It was a dark and stormy night, just like this one. And three ponies were having a slumber party, just like this one..."
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,twilight sparkle,"...and just when the last pony thought she was safe, there, standing right behind her, just inches away was--The Headless Horse!"
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,twilight sparkle,"Ghost story, check. Now, who wants s'mores?"
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,twilight sparkle,Ooo!
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,rarity,[sigh] You could at least say excuse me.
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,applejack,"Aw, I was just about to, but you interrupted me. Pardon."
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,twilight sparkle,"S'mores, check. Now the next item of fun we have to do is Truth or Dare."
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,rarity,I dare Applejack to do something carefully and neatly for a change.
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,applejack,"Oh yeah? Well I dare Rarity ta lighten up and stop obsessin' over every last little detail, for a change."
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,rarity,I think the truth of the matter is that somepony could stand to pay a little more attention to details.
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,applejack,And I think the truth is somepony oughta quit with her fussin' so the rest of us can get things done.
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,twilight sparkle,"Um, I don't think this is how the game's supposed to work. You have to give an honest answer to any question or do whatever anypony dares you to do."
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,applejack,"I dares you to step outside and let your precious, tidy mane get ruined again."
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,twilight sparkle,You have to. It's the rule.
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,applejack,Hah!
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,rarity,"Okay. I dare Applejack to play dress-up in a frou-frou, glittery, lacey outfit."
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,applejack,[gasp] Happy?
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,twilight sparkle,"Um, do I ever get a turn?"
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,applejack,I dare ya to enter the next rodeo when it comes to town.
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,rarity,I dare you not to enter the next rodeo that comes to town.
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,applejack,I dare ya to not comb your mane a hundred times before bed.
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,rarity,And I dare you to comb yours just once.
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,twilight sparkle,"I, uh, I think we should check off Truth or Dare and move on. Let's see what our next fun-fun-fun thing is, shall we? Hm, what does this mean? Pillow fight?"
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,twilight sparkle,"Oh, I get it! Pillow, fight! Fun! Ugh. Ah. Uh, girls? Maybe we should take it down a notch?"
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,applejack,I will if she will.
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,rarity,[gasp] She started it.
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,twilight sparkle,[spit] Maybe we should just call it a night and get some sleep?
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,rarity,Keep your muddy hooves on your side of the bed.
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,applejack,My hooves ain't muddy.
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,rarity,They were. There might still be a little on them.
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,applejack,There ain't. See?
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,rarity,Eww!
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,applejack,Now who's bein' inconsiderate?
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,rarity,I have to make the bed again so the blanket will be right. Get up.
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,applejack,Hey!
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,rarity,"Ah ah ah! You'll ruin it. You have to do it like this. Mm, uh, ooh, u-u-u-uh, uh, ah."
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,applejack,"Yeah, that's not gonna happen. Geronimo!"
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,rarity,Hey!
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,applejack,Ah.
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,rarity,You did that on purpose.
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,applejack,"Um, yeah?"
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,rarity,Get up so I can fix it again.
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,rarity,M-mmm!
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,applejack,I ain't budgin'.
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,rarity,You will if you want any blankets.
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,applejack,Give it back!
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,rarity,I will not!
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,applejack,"Yes, you will!"
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,rarity,Won't!
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,applejack,Will!
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,rarity,Won't!
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,applejack,Will!
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,rarity,Won't!
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,applejack,Will!
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,twilight sparkle,"Enough! It says right here that the number one thing you're supposed to do at a slumber party is have fun, and thanks to you two I can't check that off!"
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,applejack,I've been tryin' my darndest to get along.
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,rarity,"No, it is I who have been trying my best."
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,applejack,"No, it was me."
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,rarity,"No, it was I."
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,applejack,Me!
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,rarity,I!
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,twilight sparkle,"I hope you're happy, both of you. You've ruined my very first slumber party. The makeover, the s'mores, Truth or Dare, the pillow fight... I mean, is there anything else that could possibly go wrong?"
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,twilight sparkle,Sorry I asked.
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,applejack,"Ya see? That's why we needed to take down all those loose branches in town, not spiffy 'em up."
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,rarity,But I--
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,applejack,"Outta my way, missy! Time's a-wastin'."
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,rarity,Wait! Stop! Don't!
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,applejack,"No waitin'! No stoppin'! Doin'! And that, my friends, is what we call gettin' 'er done."
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,rarity,[cries] I tried to tell you it would come crashing down in here.
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,applejack,"Well, ya shoulda tried harder. [sigh] I'm mighty sorry, Twilight."
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,twilight sparkle,"It's... Well, it's not okay. There's a giant tree branch in the middle of my bedroom, and the book doesn't say anything about having a giant tree branch at your slumber party. Or at least I haven't found that entry yet. Ooh... ah!"
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,applejack,What in tarnation are y'all doin' over there?
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,rarity,"Cleaning up this mess somepony made. Who was that again? Oh, right, that's you."
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,applejack,We gotta do somethin'!
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,twilight sparkle,Baking... BFFs... Brothers... There's nothing in here about branches.
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,applejack,"[grunts] Rarity, for pony's sake, stop sweatin' the small stuff and help me get rid of this thing! I said hussle over here and help me! Look, I'm sorry, all right?"
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,rarity,What was that?
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,applejack,"I said I'm sorry! I shoulda listened to you when you noticed where this here branch would end up. Yer annoyin' attention to detail would'a saved us from this whole mess. But right now, ya need to stop bein' so dang fussy pickin' up all the little things and help me move the one big thing in here that actually matters! Please!"
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,rarity,"Uh. Uh, but I'll get all icky."
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,applejack,"Consarnit! What the... eh... you... I mean, yes, ickiness is often a side effect of hard work. But y'all need to get over it, on account I just can't fix this mess I made myself. I need your help."
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,rarity,Oh. Let's do this.
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,twilight sparkle,"Well, they do have a section about backyard slumber parties. Is that what we're doing right now? Does this count as camping?"
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,rarity,"U-ugh. Oh, I look awful."
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,applejack,Better?
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,rarity,"Hmph, thanks."
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,twilight sparkle,"Oh, pretty! Where did these come from? They're not in the book either."
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,applejack,Is it bigger than a barn?
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,twilight sparkle,[laugh] Nope.
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,rarity,Is it smaller than a saddle?
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,twilight sparkle,[laugh] No! Only three of your twenty questions left!
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,applejack,"[sigh] We're never gonna guess what you're thinkin' of, it could be anythin'."
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,rarity,Are we getting warmer?
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,twilight sparkle,Why? Is it too cold in here for you? I can turn up the heat.
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,applejack,She means are we gettin' any closer with our guesses?
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,twilight sparkle,"Oh! No. And that technically counted as a question, so only two more left!"
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,applejack,Is it... a six-legged pony with a purple polka-dotted mane and shootin' stars comin' out of his eyes?
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,rarity,"Who flies through the air all over the world to hide magic, sparkly eggs?"
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,twilight sparkle,That's it!
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,twilight sparkle,"No. [chuckle] It's that. But it was just so nice to see you two finally getting along, I wanted you to be able to win together."
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,twilight sparkle,See? We could have been having fun like this all along.
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,applejack,If only somepony hadn't been so persnickety.
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,rarity,"Well, maybe she wouldn't have been if somepony else hadn't been so sloppy."
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,applejack,Sorry for being such a pain in the patootie.
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,rarity,"Oh, no, I'm sure I was much worse."
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,applejack,"That's kind of ya to say, but I'm the one who's sorry."
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,rarity,"Oh, I'm much more sorry than you are."
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,applejack,Ugh. Are not.
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,rarity,Are too.
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,applejack,Are not!
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,rarity,Are too.
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,applejack,Are not.
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,rarity,Are too.
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,twilight sparkle,I declare my first slumber party a success!
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,twilight sparkle,"Have fun, check."
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,rarity,"Now take two steps to your left. Uh, no, my left."
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,rarity,[laughter] Sorry.
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,twilight sparkle,"Dear Princess Celestia,"
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,twilight sparkle,"It's hard to believe that two ponies who seem to have so little in common could ever get along. But I found out that if you embrace each other's differences, you just might be surprised to discover a way to be friends after all."
Look Before You Sleep,Charlotte Fullerton,twilight sparkle,"So, who's up for another slumber party tomorrow night? Ugh. How about a week from Thursday? Oh, how about two weeks from Saturday? A month from now?"
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"Wow, what a gorgeous day!"
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,spike,Rainbow Dash must have gotten up early for once and cleared all the clouds away.
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,I bet all of Ponyville is going to be out enjoying the sunshine. What? Where is everypony?
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,spike,Is it some sort of pony holiday?
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,Not that I know of.
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,Not more than usual.
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,spike,Is it... zombies?!
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,Uh... not very likely.
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,spike,Not likely... but possible?
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,Psst! Twilight! Spike! Come here! Come! Here! Hurry! Before she gets you!
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,spike,Who?! The zombie pony?
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,Z-Zombie pony?!
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"Spike! There are no zombie ponies. Pinkie, what are you doing here alone in the dark?"
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,I'm not alone in the dark.
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"[gasp] Okay then, what are you all doing here in the dark?"
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,We're hidin' from her!
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,apple bloom,Did you see her Twilight? Did you see... Zecora?
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,Apple Bloom! I told you never to say that name.
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"Well, I saw her glance this way..."
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,Glance evilly this way.
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,... And then a bunch of you flip out for no good reason.
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"No good reason? You call protectin' yer kin no good reason? Why, as soon as my sister saw Zecora ridin' into town, she started shakin' in her lil' horseshoes."
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,apple bloom,[shakily] Did not!
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,So I swept her up and brought her here.
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,apple bloom,I walked here myself!
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,For safe keepin'.
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,apple bloom,"Applejack, I'm not a baby! I can take care of myself!"
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,Not from that creepy Zecora.
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,fluttershy,She's mysterious.
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,Sinister.
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,And spoooooky!
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,Will you cut that out?
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,Just look at those stripes! So garish!
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,She's a zebra.
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"A zebra, and her stripes aren't a fashion choice Rarity, they're what she was born with."
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"Born where? I've never seen a pony like that in these parts, 'cept... her!"
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"Well, she's probably not from here, and she's not a pony. My books say that zebras come from a faraway land. But I've never seen her in Ponyville. Where does she live?"
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"That's just it, she lives in... the Everfree Forest!"
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,Spike!
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,spike,"Uh, sorry."
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,The Everfree Forest just ain't natural. The plants grow...
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,fluttershy,Animals care for themselves...
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,And the clouds move...
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,And that wicked enchantress Zecora lives there doing her evil... stuff! She's so evil I even wrote a song about her!
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,Here we go...
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,She's an evil enchantress She does evil dances And if you look deep in her eyes She'll put you in trances Then what will she do? She'll mix up an evil brew Then she'll gobble you up In a big tasty stew Soooo... Watch out!
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,Wow. Catchy.
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,It's a work in progress.
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,This is all just a lot of gossip and rumors. Now tell me; what exactly have you actually seen Zecora do?
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,"Well... Once a month, she comes into Ponyville."
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,[dramatically] Oooooh.
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,"Then, she lurks by the stores."
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"[dramatically] Oh, my."
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,fluttershy,"And then, she digs at the ground."
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"[dramatically] Good gracious! [normal tone] Okay, I'm sorry. But how is any of this bad? Maybe she comes to town to visit?"
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,apple bloom,Yeah! Maybe she's just tryin' to be neighborly.
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"And maybe she's not lurking by the stores, maybe she's going to them, lurk free, to do some shopping?"
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,apple bloom,Yeah! Everypony likes to shop. You know what I think?
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,Apple Bloom! Hush and let the big ponies talk.
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,apple bloom,[under breath] I am a big pony!
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,W-what about digging at the ground? You've got to admit that's weird.
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,fluttershy,What if she's digging for innocent creatures?
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"I am sure there is an explanation for everything Zecora does. And if anypony here were actually brave enough to approach her, she would find out the truth."
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,You ponies are being ridiculous!
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"Well, I heard that Zecora eats hay."
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"Pinkie, I eat hay; you eat hay!"
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"Yeah, but I heard it's the evil way she eats hay."
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,Hey! Where's Apple Bloom?
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,fluttershy,The door's open.
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,She went outside!
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,And Zecora's still out there.
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,[sigh] That silly lil' filly! I told her to stay put!
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"Spike, you stay here in case Apple Bloom comes back."
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,spike,Will do!
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,Apple Bloom?
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,You get back here right now!
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,zecora,"Beware! Beware, you pony folk! Those leaves of blue are not a joke!"
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"Y-you keep your creepy mumbo-jumbo to yourself, ya hear?"
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,[sighs] Oh brother.
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,zecora,Beware! Beware!
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,"Yeah, back at ya, Zecora! You and your lame curse are the ones who better beware!"
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,And you! Why couldn't you just listen to yer big sister?
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,apple bloom,I...I...
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,Who knows what kind of nasty curse Zecora could have just put on you?
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"You guys, there's no such thing as curses!"
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,"Well, that's interesting to hear coming from Miss Magic Pants herself."
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"My magic, real magic, comes from within. It's a skill you're born with. Curses are artificial, fake magic. It's conjured with potions and incantations; all smoke and mirrors meant to scare. But curses have no real power, they're just an old pony tale."
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"Just you wait, Twilight. You're gonna learn that some pony tales really are true."
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"She's an evil enchantress, she does evil dances!"
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,zecora,Beware! Beware!
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"If you look deep in her eyes, she will put you in trances!"
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,"Yeah, was that supposed to scare us?!"
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,"Wicked, wicked zebra!"
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,fluttershy,... it's a curse.
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,Then what will she do?
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"Just you wait, Twilight; some pony tales really are true."
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,Then she'll gobble you up in a big tasty stew! Soooo... Watch out!
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"Ugh... what a dream... Curses, schmurses. Whoa! [chuckle] Maybe Zecora cursed my hair. [Laughs nervously and then gasps] Or she cursed my horn!"
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,No no no no no! None of these books have a cure! Ugh! There has to be a real reason for this! An illness? An allergy?!
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,spike,A curse!
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,I said a real reason. Something that points to something real.
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,spike,How about this one?
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"""Supernaturals""? Spike, the word supernatural refers to things like ghosts and spirits and zombies, which are as make-believe as curses. This book is just a bunch of hooey!"
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,spike,"But what if you're wrong, Twilight? What if this really is a-"
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,Ah pfurse!
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,spike,A purse? How could it be a purse?
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,Pinkie? What happened?
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,Pee pah Zthecora! Sthe put a cursthe on me!
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,spike,"Hey, say it, don't spray it, Pinkie!"
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,[thud] Ow! [thud] Oh! She's [thud] trying to say-ow!- Zecora [thud]-oh!-[crash] she slapped us all with a-ow- curse!
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"[high pitched voice] I hate to say I told ya so, Twilight, but I told ya so!"
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"It's a curse, I tells ya!"
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,But Fluttershy... seems just fine!
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,"Yes, there doesn't seem to be a thing wrong with her."
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"Fluttershy? Are you okay? Is there something wrong with you? Would you care to tell us? So... you're not going to tell us? Yes you're not, or yes you will?"
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"Good gravy, girl! What's wrong with you?!"
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,fluttershy,[deep male voice] I don't want to talk about it.
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,spike,"This is hilarious! [laughs] Look at all of you! We got: Hairity, Rainbow Crash, Spitty Pie, Apple Teeny, Flutterguy, and... uh... I got nothin'... Twilight Sparkle. I mean seriously, I can't even work with that."
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"[Sarcastic laughter] This is no joke, Spike. Now start looking for more books so I can find a cure!"
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,[groans] I think we'll find a cure to this curse at Zecora's place!
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,It's not a curse!
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,I agree with Dash! We'll go to Zecora's and force her to remove this hex!
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,It's not a hex either!
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,apple bloom,"This is all my fault. If I hadn't followed Zecora in the first place, none of this would have happened. I just gotta fix this."
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,Now where does she think she's goin' this time?
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,"I don't care what you say, Twilight. It's time to pony up and confront Zecora. Come on, girls. Are you with me?"
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,Ah am-pft!
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,And I as well.
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,fluttershy,"Uh, I don't know. Seems awfully dangerous."
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,"How about you, Applejack? Applejack?"
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,Pf-she's gone-pft!
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,Aah! Or somepony stepped on her!
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,... or sat on her?
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,Rarity's hair!
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,"Oh! OH! Pinkie, what are you doing? Ah, really. Aah! You ever hear of personal space?"
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,Nopthe.
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,Apple Bloom is gone too!
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,I bet they went after Zecora.
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"Well we better go find them. Come on girls, let's go."
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,"[grunt] Oh dear. Oh, this is so unseemly. Auuuaah!"
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,"Hey, a little help here?"
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,fluttershy,Oopsie! Sorry.
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,[crash] OW!
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,fluttershy,Uh... Spike? Are you coming?
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,spike,Nope! Uh... gotta stay here and look for a cure. [gasp] Twilight Flopple!
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"Stop right there! Turn around right now, missy!"
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,apple bloom,No.
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,No?! You can't ignore a direct order from your big sister!
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,apple bloom,"Hehehe. Sorry, Applejack, but I'm the big sister now."
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"Apple Bloom, you come back here right this instant! I'm gonna tell Big McIntosh on you! Aw, pony feathers."
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,C'mon girls. We've got to get to Zecora's. Hurry!
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,Ooh... Ahaha. Easier said than done.
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,Rainbow! Thank Celestia! There's no time to lose! I need to get to Zecora's pronto! Giddy-up pony!
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,Ex-CUSE me?
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,YEEE-HAW!
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,What the...
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"No, Rainbow Dash. Other way!"
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,Oh. I look horrible!
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,Plis place plooks horrible!
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,"Oh my. That place really does look horrible. Nice decorations, if you like creepy!"
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,Sthe sthtole my sthong! Shthe shtole mm mm!
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,She stole your song?
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,Oh Pinkie. Doesn't sound anything like your song.
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,You saw those terrible things. Now do you believe us Twilight?
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"Scary looking masks, confusing incantations, and a great big bubbling cauldron? [sigh] Everything is pointing to Zecora being... bad. Or... what if Zecora is just making soup?"
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,zecora,"Mmm! The perfect temperature for ponies, I presume. Now, where is that little Apple Bloom?"
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,Or... what if she's making Apple Bloom soup?!
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,What if she's making Apple Bloom soup?!
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"I'm comin' for ya, Apple Bloom!"
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,Aaah!
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"Whoa there. Easy, Rainbow Crash."
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,What have you done with Apple Bloom?
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,Ahh!
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,zecora,Ponies! What is this you...
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,zecora,No! You know not what you do! You've gone and spilled my precious brew!
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"We're onto you Zecora. I didn't want to believe that you cursed us, but the evidence is overwhelming!"
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,You made me look ridiculous.
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,fluttershy,You made me sound ridiculous!
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,[incoherent] You made me speak ridiculous!
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,You ruined my horn!
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,zecora,"How dare you! You destroy my home, destroy my work, then rudely accuse me of being a jerk?"
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,"You put this curse on us, now you're gonna uncurse us."
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,zecora,It is unwise to venture down this road. Your actions will make my anger explode!
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,Where is Apple Bloom!?
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,apple bloom,Zecora! I think I found all the things ya asked for. What in Ponyville is goin' on here?
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,[gasp] Apple Bloom! You're okay!
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,apple bloom,Why wouldn't I be?
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,Because Zecora is an evil enchantress who cursed us and was gonna cook you up into soup!
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,apple bloom,Oh Twilight. Did those silly fillies finally get in yer head? You know there's no such thing as a curse.
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"Apple Bloom, sweetie. You can't just stand there and tell me this isn't a curse."
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,apple bloom,This isn't a curse.
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,zecora,"If you will remember back, the words I spoke were quite exact. [flashback]: Beware, beware you pony folk. Those leaves of blue are not a joke."
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,apple bloom,It was a warnin'. About that blue plant. It's called Poison Joke.
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,zecora,That plant is much like poison oak. But its results are like a joke.
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,What in the hay does that mean?
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,zecora,It means this plant does not breed wrath. Instead this plant just wants a laugh.
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,Will somepony please talk normal?
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"I think what she's saying is that when we ran in to save Apple Bloom, we ran into the poison joke. All our problems are just little jokes it played on us."
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,Little jokes?! Very funny.
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,"Okay, fine. But what about the cauldron?"
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,fluttershy,And the chanting?
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,And the creepy d<e9>cor?
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,zecora,"Treasures of the native land where I am from. This one speaks 'hello', and this 'welcome'."
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,"Not welcoming at all, if you ask me."
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,zecora,The words I chanted were from olden times. Something you call a nursery rhyme.
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,But the cauldron... The Apple Bloom soup?
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,apple bloom,"Lookie here Twilight. That pot of water wasn't for me, it was for all these herbal ingredients. The cure for poison joke is a simple old-natural remedy. You just gotta take a bubble bath!"
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,But I tried to find a cure in all my books and couldn't find anything. What book has this natural remedy?
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,zecora,"Here is the book, you see? Sad that you lack it in your library."
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"Actually, I do have this book, but I didn't look inside because the title was so... Weird. Supernaturals: Natural Remedies and Cure-alls That Are Simply Super. I...I... I'm so sorry, Zecora. I had the answer the whole time, if only I had bothered to look inside."
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,zecora,"[chuckle] Maybe next time you will take a second look, and not judge the cover of the book."
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,apple bloom,Hahaha.
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,Zecora? Would you be kind enough to mix up another batch of the herbal bath?
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,zecora,Mix it up I certainly will. Yet I am missing an herb from Ponyville.
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,apple bloom,"But whenever Zecora comes to town, all the shops are mysteriously closed."
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"Oh, well... I think we can help you with that."
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"Daisy, we need to talk."
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"Dear Princess Celestia,"
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"My friends and I all learned an important lesson this week: Never judge a book by its cover. Someone may look unusual, or funny, or scary. But you have to look past that and learn who they are inside. Real friends don't care what your ""cover"" is; it's the ""contents"" of a pony that count. And a good friend, like a good book, is something that will last forever."
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,apple bloom,"Applejack! Hey, where's Applejack?!"
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"[normal voice] I'm right here, little sis. I ain't tiny no more!"
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,Oh! I have never felt so lovely in all my life!
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"Oh, my gosh! I never realized how horrible it is not to be able to talk. I mean, I love talking so much, and when I couldn't talk anymore, my tongue was all 'ehhhh'! It was the worst! Don't you agree, Fluttershy?"
Bridle Gossip,Amy Keating Rogers,fluttershy,[normal voice] ... Yes.
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,"La, la la, la la, la la, la la. Thank you little squirrel, but remember: these flowers are for Princess Celestia. Only the prettiest ones will do. La, la la, la la, la la, la la."
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,Gah!
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,"Hello, little guy. I've never seen anything like you before."
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,"Oh, are you hungry? Here you go. [gasp] I guess you were hungry."
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,You're the cutest thing ever! I can't wait to show you to my friends.
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Oh! Hurry up, Spike! This place isn't gonna clean itself."
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,spike,It also didn't mess itself up.
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,Princess Celestia will be here tomorrow!
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,spike,I thought this was just an unofficial casual visit.
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"There's nothing casual about a visit from royalty. I want this place to be spotless, and you've barely made a dent in the clutter."
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,spike,"Maybe you should, ugh, start reading them one at a time-- whoa ho! Aw."
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,Everything's got to be perfect. No time for fooling around.
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,spike,"You know, this would be an awful lot easier if there weren't two of us here getting under each other's feet."
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Great idea. You clean, I'll go see how everyone else's preparations are coming."
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,What happened to the rest of her name?
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"You can't hang a banner that says ""Welcome Princess Celest"". Take it down and try again."
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,That looks perfect. Keep up the good work.
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Hello, Mr. and Mrs. Cake. How's the banquet coming?"
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,mrs. cake,Mrs. Uh...it would be coming a little better if...
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,Pinkie! What are you doing? Those sweets are supposed to be for the princess.
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,"I know. That's why I'm tasting them. Somepony needs to make sure that everything is tasty enough to touch the royal tongue, and I, Pinkie Pie, declare that these treats are fit for a king, or a queen, or a princess."
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,"Twilight, Pinkie, you won't believe... oh, I'm sorry. Uh, am I interrupting?"
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,"No, not at all. Come on in and make yourself at home. [slurp] What's going on, Fluttershy?"
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,"You won't believe what I found at the edge of the Everfree Forest. Come on out, little guy. It's okay."
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,[gasp] Three?
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,They're amazing. What are they?
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,I'm not sure. I'm also not sure where these other two came from.
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"I'll take one off your hooves. I've never seen anything so... adorable. Besides, it'll be nice to have a companion for Spike so he won't bother me so much while I'm studying."
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,"Pinkie, do you want the other one?"
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,Ugh! A parasprite? Are you kidding?
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,Ugh?
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,A para-what?
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,How could you not like...
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,Ugh. Now I gotta go find a trombone.
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,A what?
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Ahhh, typical Pinkie."
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,rarity,"Stand still, Rainbow Dash."
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,"Ugh, I caaan't, I need to flyyy! This is waaay too boring for me."
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,rarity,Do you want to look nice for Princess Celestia or not?
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Wow. Rarity, those outfits are gorgeous."
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,rarity,"Mmhmm. Thank you, Twilight. Nice to know someone appreciates my talents."
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,"Ugh, sooo boooring."
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,rarity,Huh?
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,"What's that sound, Twilight?"
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,"Wow, what are they?"
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"The better question is, where did they come from? I only had one a minute ago."
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,"Uh, I'll take one."
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,rarity,"Me too, oh, they're perfect."
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,Does anypony know where I can find an accordion?
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,Girls! Hello! This is important. Durgh! Thanks a lot.
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"[sigh] The decorations, the banquet, I really hope everything comes together in time for tomorrow."
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Oh, [yawn] what's there to worry about?"
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,Spike! Wake up! What happened?
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,spike,Huh? Whaaa! What's going on?
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,Where did they come from?
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,spike,"I don't know. The little guy got hungry in the night, so I gave him a snack, but... I have no idea where these others came from. Oh no! They're messing up all my hard work!"
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,The princess will be here in a few hours.
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,spike,Ugh.
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Spike, help me round up these little guys."
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,spike,"Ugh, what does it look like I'm doin'? Ooow, waaah! D'oh. I know, I know, ""stop fooling around""."
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,Huh? Huh?! [screech] [grunt] [groan] Get off me! [groan] [grunt] Waaa!
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,rarity,"Not only are you adorable, but you're also quite useful."
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,rarity,Oh! Are you okay? Aaah! [gasp] Eewww. Aaah! Gross gross gross! No creature that behaves so revoltingly is allowed in my boutique!
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,"Look Rarity, Applejack loaned me a harmonica. [plays harmonica] Isn't that great?"
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,[gasp] And not a moment too soon.
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,rarity,"Ugh, Pinkie, I'm a little busy right now."
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,"And I'm not? You know how many more instruments I've gotta find? A lot, that's how many. Now if we split the list between us, we might just make it in time."
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,rarity,"Please, Pinkie, I don't have time for some silly scavenger hunt. I've got a real problem."
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,"You've got a real problem, all right. And a banjo is the only answer!"
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,rarity,[gasp] I see we're having the same problem.
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,Ditto!
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Fluttershy knows everything about animals, I'm sure she can tell us how to stop them from multiplying."
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,...or not.
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Ugh, do something Fluttershy, can't you control them?"
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,"I've tried everything I know: I've tried begging, and pleading, and beseeching, and asking politely and..."
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,Guh.
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"If we can't get them under control before the princess arrives, it'll be a total disaster."
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,rarity,"Ew! If you ask me, it's already a total disaster."
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,applejack,"Here's all those apples you wanted, Fluttershy, but I still can't figure why y'need so many. Hey!"
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,What do we do?
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,[gasp] I got it! Nopony can herd like Applejack.
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,Yeah! We can drive 'em back into the forest.
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,applejack,"[scoffs] I'll rastle 'em up, but I need everypony's help to do it. Twilight, you and Rarity wait over there. I'll herd the little critters straight at ya like a funnel. Rainbow Dash, you and Fluttershy stay on top of 'em, don't let 'em fly away."
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,Aye aye.
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,applejack,Yeeeeeee-haw!
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,applejack,"Alright y'all, here goes nothin'. Look out Rarity, that one's fixin' to get away. Keep a lead on 'em, Rainbow Dash! Hold on girls, we're almost there."
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,Pinkie!
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,"Twilight, we don't have much time."
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,You're telling me. The princess could arrive at any moment.
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,Exactly. That's why I need you gals to drop what you're doing and help me find some maracas.
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Maracas? Pinkie, we've got much bigger problems than missing maracas."
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,"[gasp] You're right! Getting a tuba has to be our number one goal. Follow me. I said, follow me!"
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,"Pinkie Pie, you are so random."
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,And you are all so stubborn!
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,applejack,Forget her ladies. Focus. Head 'em up and move 'em out.
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,Ouch.
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"We did it. Nice work, Applejack."
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,applejack,Couldn't a'done it without y'all.
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,Now let's get back and clean up the mess they made before the princess arrives.
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Okay, everyone knows what to do, right? We gotta work extra hard to make up for lost time."
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,Where did they come from?
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,"Well, I may have kept just one. Heh. I couldn't help myself. They're just so cute."
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,We don't have time to keep rounding up these things. What do we do now?
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,Time to take out the adorable trash. YAAAAAA!
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"[grunt] Way to go, Rainbow Dash!"
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,applejack,Looks like our problems are solved.
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,They will be with these cymbals. [crash] Hey! Give me those back!
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,Whoa. Yaa! Yow! Whoa! Wow! I can't hold it! She's breaking up.
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Pinkie Pie, what have you done?"
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,"I've lost a brand new pair of cymbals, that's what I've done."
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,Will you forget about your silly instruments for one second? You're ruining our efforts to save Ponyville.
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,"Me? Ruin? I'm not the ruiner, I'm the ruin-ee! Or is it ruiness? Ruinette?"
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,applejack,"Come on girls, there's no reasoning with that one. She's a few apples short of a bushel."
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,Hey! I'm trying to tell you all that the ruining is on the other hoof. If you'd just slow down and listen to me!
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,What do we do? They're eating all the food in town.
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,applejack,[gasp] My apples!
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,We've gotta do something. [gasps] I got it! I'll cast a spell to make them stop eating all the food.
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,"Heh. Hey, it worked. They're not eating the food anymore."
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,rarity,Oh no... if they get inside my store... Everypony for herself!
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,I'll save you!
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,applejack,No woodland creature's gonna eat the Apple Family's crop.
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,applejack,"Brace yourself, y'all, here they come. [gasp] Didn't see that one comin'."
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,spike,Help!
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,spike,Help...
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,zecora,Ugh. Have you gone mad?
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Zecora, these little guys are devouring Ponyville, and the princess is on her way. Can you help us, please?"
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,zecora,"Oh, monster of so little size. Is that a parasprite before my eyes?"
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,I don't know! Is it?
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,zecora,"Tales of crops and harvests consumed. If these creatures are in Ponyville, you're doomed."
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"[grunts] Oh no, here she comes."
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Okay, here's the plan. Rainbow Dash, you distract them."
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,YAAAA!
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Good. Everyone else, we need to build an exact copy of Ponyville right over there. We've got less than a minute. Zecora was right, we're doomed. Oh no, the princess's procession is here. It's all over!"
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,Pinkie? We're in the middle of a crisis here. This is no time for your... nonsense?
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,Look.
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,princess celestia,"Twilight Sparkle, my prized pupil."
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Hello, princess."
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,princess celestia,"So lovely to see you again, as well as your friends."
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,So... how was the trip? Hit much traffic?
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,princess celestia,"Ah, what is this? Oh ho ho, these creatures are adorable."
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,They're not that adorable.
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,princess celestia,I'm terribly honored that you and the good citizens of Ponyville have organized a parade in honor of my visit.
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Parade? Oh. Yes, the parade."
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,princess celestia,"Unfortunately, that visit is going to have to wait for another time. I'm afraid an emergency has come up in Fillydelphia. Apparently there's been some sort of infestation."
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,An... infestation?
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,princess celestia,"Yes, a swarm of incredibly bothersome creatures has invaded the poor town. I'm sorry Twilight, to have to put you all through so much trouble."
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,Trouble? What trouble?
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,princess celestia,"Before I have to go, would you care to give me your latest report on the magic of friendship in person?"
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,My... report?
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,princess celestia,Haven't you learned anything about friendship?
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Actually, I have. I've learned that sometimes the solution to your problems can come from where you least expect it. It's a good idea to stop and listen to your friends' opinions and perspectives..."
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,Even when they don't always seem to make sense.
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,princess celestia,"I'm so proud of you, Twilight Sparkle, and I'm very impressed with your friends as well. It sounds like you're all learning so much from each other."
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Thank you, princess."
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,"Hey, what happened to the princess?"
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,Emergency in Fillydelphia.
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,Some sort of infestation.
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,"Oh no! Have they got parasprites too? Well, have tuba, will travel."
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,I think the princess can handle it.
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,applejack,"So you knew what those critters were all along, huh Pinkie Pie?"
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,"Well, duh! Why do you think I was so frantic to get my hooves on all these instruments? I tried to tell you."
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"We know, Pinkie Pie, and we're sorry we didn't listen."
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"You're a great friend, even if we don't always understand you."
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,"Thanks guys, you're all great friends too, even when I don't understand me."
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"You saved my reputation with Princess Celestia, and more importantly, you saved Ponyville."
Swarm of the Century,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,...Or not.
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,"[gasp] Spike, wake up. Wake up, wake up, it's Winter Wrap Up day!"
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,spike,Huh? Mommy?
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,Winter Wrap Up!
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,spike,You're not mommy.
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,"Spike, the first day of spring is tomorrow, so everypony in Ponyville needs to clean up winter. Now help me get ready."
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,spike,Clean up winter? Who cleans up winter? Don't they just use magic to change the seasons like they do in Canterlot?
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,spike,It's ridiculous. No magic... Fuh.
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,"Okay, let's see: scarf, check; saddle, check; boots, check; Spike refusing to get up and going back to sleep, check. It's a good thing I'm so organized, I'm ready. Bright and early. Oh... maybe a little too early."
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,"Those must be the team vests Rarity designed. Blue for the weather team, green for the plant team, and tan for the animal team. I wonder which team vest I'll be wearing."
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,spike,"I'll take a blue vest, same color as my blankie, which I think I hear calling my name. ""Spike! Spike! Come to bed!"" Ugh, it's too early."
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,mayor mare,"Thank you, everypony, for being here bright and early. We need every single pony's help to wrap up winter, and bring in spring."
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,mayor mare,"Now, all of you have your vests, and have been assigned to your teams, so let's do even better than last year, and have the quickest Winter Wrap Up ever!"
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,"Oh, this is so exciting."
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,mayor mare,"All right everypony, find your team leader, and let's get galloping!"
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,"Oh gosh, where should I go? I'm not sure where I fit in. What exactly does everypony do?"
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,Three months of winter coolness And awesome holidays
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,pinkie pie,We've kept our hoovsies warm at home Time off from work to play
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,applejack,But the food we've stored is runnin' out And we can't grow in this cold
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,rarity,And even though I love my boots This fashion's getting old
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,"The time has come to welcome spring And all things warm and green But it's also time to say goodbye It's winter we must clean How can I help? I'm new, you see What does everypony do? How do I fit in without magic? I haven't got a clue!"
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,applejack,'Cause tomorrow spring<U+0096>
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,<U+0096>is here!
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,Bringing home the southern birds A Pegasus' job begins And clearing all the gloomy skies To let the sunshine in We move the clouds And we melt the white snow
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,rarity,Little critters hibernate Under the snow and ice
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,fluttershy,We wake up all their sleepy heads So quietly and nice
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,rarity,We help them gather up their food Fix their homes below
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,fluttershy,We welcome back the southern birds
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,applejack,"No easy task to clear the ground Plant our tiny seeds With proper care and sunshine Everyone it feeds Apples, carrots, celery stalks Colorful flowers too We must work so very hard"
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,pinkie pie,'Cause tomorrow spring is here
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,"Now that I know what they all do I have to find my place And help with all of my heart Tough task ahead I face How will I do without my magic Help the Earth pony way I wanna belong so I must Do my best today, Do my best today!"
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,'Cause tomorrow spring is here 'Cause tomorrow spring is here 'Cause tomorrow spring is here!
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,Everypony belongs to a team. What should I do? Where should I go?
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,"All right team, you're clear for takeoff."
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,Rainbow Dash!
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,"Oh, hey Twilight, what's up?"
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,What are you doing?
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,Sending off one of my flight crews to retrieve the birds that have flown south for the winter.
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,"Oh, can I help? How about if I help clear out the clouds?"
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,Um...
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,Right. No wings.
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,"Sorry, Twilight."
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,"[gasp] Great, now what do we do?"
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,"Come on Spike, this is serious business. Winter needs to be wrapped up, and I'm determined to do my part. Somehow."
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,"Rarity, please tell me there's something, anything I can help you with."
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,rarity,"Well, how would you like to help create Ponyville's finest birds' nests?"
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,Birds' nests?
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,rarity,"Why yes. When the weather team guides the birds back north for the spring, they'll need a place to live and lay their eggs."
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,"Wow, Rarity, that one's really beautiful."
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,rarity,"Oh why, thank you most sincerely. Would you like to try your hoof at a nest?"
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,Would I? Yes! Where do I begin?
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,rarity,"Okay. Now... uh, take some of that straw and hay over there, and a little bit of branch. Now, weave them through there, yes. Uh, take some ribbon, yes, oh uh, n... not there, oooh, yes, uh, tuck it in over there, uh but be careful not to... I don't know I guess that would do... oh dear."
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,There! It looks just like... yours. Oh my.
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,spike,That nest needs to be condemned.
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,rarity,"Oh, Spa-ha-hike, it's not so bad, ah, maybe birds can use it as a..."
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,spike,An outhouse?
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,Hw...
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,spike,I think we lost her.
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,rarity,"Ah, and we need to weave the string..."
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,pinkie pie,"Hellooooooo, Twilight! Wheeeeeeee!"
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,"Wow, Pinkie Pie, you're quite the skater. Probably the best skater I've ever seen."
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,pinkie pie,"Thanks Twilight, I've been doing this since I was an itty-bitty little-wittle Twinkie-Pinkie. Just comes natural. Which is probably why they designated me the lake scorer. I cut lines in the lakes with my skates. That way, when the rest of the weather team comes here to break the ice, it'll be easy as pie."
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,"How clever. When the thick ice begins to melt, it'll break along the lines. Well, you sure have a lot of work ahead of you, there's quite a few lakes in Ponyville."
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,pinkie pie,"Ha, tell me about it. Hey, Twilight, wanna help me out?"
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,Would I?
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,pinkie pie,"Come on, put on those skates over there. I bet you'll be a natural too."
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,Okay.
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,Uh... maybe on second thought.
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,spike,What are you talking about? You said you wanted to be helpful.
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,pinkie pie,Yippie!
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,spike,Now get out there.
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,"Oh no, whoa, wow..."
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,pinkie pie,"Twilight, steer! Steer!"
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,Yaaaaa!
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,pinkie pie,Oh boy...
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,spike,Pwuh.
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,pinkie pie,"Twilight, you did a great job your first time around. I'm sure my first time was just as wobbly and bobbly and crasheriffic as yours."
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,Really?
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,pinkie pie,No.
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,pinkie pie,But did I make you feel better?
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,"Mm-hmm, yeah, I guess."
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,pinkie pie,"I think you'll be super awesome at something that keeps your hooves on the ground. I know, Fluttershy could probably use your help with the critters."
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,"Well... I'm pretty good with little animals. Yeah, I'll go help her."
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,pinkie pie,"Uh... it's, ah, that a-way."
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,Yaaaaaa!
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,fluttershy,"Wake up, little sleepy heads. Hope you had some wonderful dreams and restful hibernation, but it's time to get up now, spring is coming."
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,"Awww, how cute."
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,fluttershy,"Aren't they? This is my favorite task the whole season, when I get to see all my little animal friends again."
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,spike,"Uh, what's ""hibernation""?"
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,fluttershy,It's like a long sleep.
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,spike,Long sleep?
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,fluttershy,"Yes. [bell rings] Wake up, little porcupines. Animals often hibernate through the winter to save their energy and eat less food."
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,spike,"I definitely like the idea of hibernation, uh, except for the ""eat less food"" part."
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,fluttershy,"Oh, would you just look at all these warrens and dens? I'm worried that I won't be able to wake up every animal before spring comes."
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,"Well, I'll help, Fluttershy."
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,fluttershy,"You will? Oh, that would be wonderful."
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,"Okay, let's start there."
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,"Hello? Wake up little friends, wherever you are. Spring is coming. [bell rings] I wonder which cute little furry creatures I've awoken."
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,Waaa! Snakes! Snakes! [scream] Ugh! [grunt] [scream] Ugh!
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,fluttershy,"Good morning, friends."
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,[sigh] All this Winter Wrap Up stuff is a lot harder than it looks.
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,spike,"[nasally] Right, because there's no magic. Why don't you just use magic, Twilight, and get it done the right way?"
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,"No, Spike, I have to do it the traditional way. Ponyville has never needed magic to wrap up winter."
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,spike,"[nasally] Well, they never had you here before, either. Think how much quicker they could wrap up winter with your magic."
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,applejack,"Keep pushin', Caramel. That's it, Bumpkin. I know it's hard work, but you guys are doin' great. Yee-haw!"
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,"Hey, Applejack. How's everything going?"
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,applejack,"Oh, just dandy. A little slow startin', but peachy all the same. There's a lot of ground to clear, ya hear? We can't even start the plantin' and the waterin' until we git all these heap a' snow hightailed outta here."
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,"Well, I'd like to help."
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,applejack,"Well, I... I dunno Twilight."
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,Just give me a chance.
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,applejack,"Well, I never turn down a hard worker, but..."
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,spike,Think of how much quicker they could wrap up winter with your magic.
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,I could use a come-to-life spell. Hwww... Here goes...
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,applejack,Hmm. She's awful strong for such a little pony.
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,spike,"That's my girl, following my advice."
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,applejack,And what in tarnation does that mean?
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,[gasp] Uh-oh. Slow down. Slow down!
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,applejack,"What's going on? Wha'd'ya do? You used magic, didn't you?"
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,applejack,"Nuts, Twilight, you used magic."
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,spike,The nerve. Can you believe her?
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,applejack,"That's not how we do it 'round here, Twilight, and especially not on MY FARM!"
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,spike,"Come on, Twilight. Come on out."
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,I'm a winter mess up.
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,spike,"Well you're good at a lot of things, just not nest-making, ice-skating, animal-waking, snow-clearing."
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,[whine] Thanks a lot for making me feel so much better.
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,spike,"That's what I'm here for, sister."
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,applejack,"Rainbow Dash, y'all on the weather team need to melt the rest of the snow here on the ground and the trees, pronto."
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,Got it.
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,fluttershy,Wait. My poor little animals' homes will get flooded if the snow melts too fast.
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,Got it.
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,applejack,"I'm tellin' you, Rainbow, you gotta melt that snow now."
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,fluttershy,"No, you simply must wait."
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,Okay.
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,applejack,Go.
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,fluttershy,Stop.
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,applejack,Go.
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,fluttershy,Stop.
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,applejack,GO!
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,fluttershy,STOP!
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,Ugh! Make up your minds!
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,mayor mare,"Oh! What in Equestria are all you arguing about? This sort of silliness is why we were late for spring last year, and the year before that, and the year before that."
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,Did she say late?
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,mayor mare,"I was hoping my amazingly inspirational speech would urge everyone to do better than last year, but now it looks like we're going to be later than ever. I mean just look at this catastrophe. The ice scorers made the ice chunks too big to melt. The nest designer is horrendously behind, we need several hundred, and she's only made one."
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,mayor mare,"And don't get me started on all the clouds in the sky, the icicles on the trees... This isn't good, not at all!"
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,applejack,And it's gonna be all to pieces disastrous if we can't get our seeds all planted.
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,"Chillax Applejack, we're bustin' our chops as fast as we can."
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,fluttershy,"No, not fast, we have to wake animals slowly."
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,big mcintosh,"Uh, AJ?"
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,applejack,"Oh good gravy, Caramel lost the grass seeds again, didn't he?"
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,big mcintosh,Eeyup.
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,Oh that featherbrain. Didn't she learn her lesson last year when she went west?
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,mayor mare,Stop this at once. We don't have time to argue. It's almost sundown. Spring is going to be late again. Another year of scandal and shame. If only we could be more organized.
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,"Spike! Get my checklist and clipboard, STAT!"
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,spike,"Eh, yes, ma'am."
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,"Stop, everypony!"
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,Stop!
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,"Sorry. I know you all want to complete your jobs on time, but arguing is no way to go about it. What you need is organization, and I'm just the pony for the job."
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,mayor mare,I can't believe it. Spring is here! On time! And we have you to thank for it. If it weren't for your organizing skills we would still be arguing.
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,big mcintosh,Eeyup.
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,It was a team effort.
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,mayor mare,"And since you helped every team, we have an official vest for you. We give you the title, ""All-Team Organizer""."
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,"Gosh, I don't even know what to say. Thank you, everypony."
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,mayor mare,And hereby I declare that winter is... wrapped up on time.
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,applejack,Spike's sure gonna be in for a hog-sized surprised when that last piece a' ice melts.
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,"Dear Princess Celestia,"
Winter Wrap Up,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,"Winter Wrap Up was one of the most special things I've ever been a part of here in Ponyville. It helped me to learn we all have hidden talents, and if we're patient and diligent, we're sure to find them, and as always, with good friendship and teamwork, ponies can accomplish anything. How's that, Spike? Spike?"
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,cheerilee,Let's quiet down please. We have a very important lesson to get to. [class quiets down] Thank you. Today we are going to be talking about cutie marks.
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,cheerilee,"You can all see my cutie mark, can't you? Like all ponies, I wasn't born with a cutie mark. My flank was blank."
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,cheerilee,"Then one day, when I was about your age, I woke up to find that a cutie mark had appeared."
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,cheerilee,"Yes I know, but honestly, that's how everypony was wearing their mane back then. I had decided to become a teacher, and the flowers symbolized my hope that I could help my future students bloom if I nurture them with knowledge. The smiles represented the cheer I hope to bring to my little ponies while they were learning. Now, can anyone tell me when a pony gets his or her cutie mark?"
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,cheerilee,"That's right, Twist. A cutie mark appears on a pony's flank when he or she finds that certain something that makes them different from every other pony. Discovering what makes you unique isn't something [Diamond Tiara: Pssst!] that happens overnight, and no amount of hoping, wishing, [Diamond Tiara: Pssst!] or begging, would make a cutie mark appear before its time."
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,diamond tiara,Pssst!
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,What?!
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,cheerilee,Apple Bloom! Are you passing a note?
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,"Uh, I... Um..."
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,cheerilee,What could be so important that it couldn't wait until after class? [gasp] It's blank.
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,Mm-mm.
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,No...
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,diamond tiara,"I don't know why we had to sit through a lecture about getting a cutie mark. I mean, waiting for your cutie mark is sooo last week. You got yours, I just got mine. We all have them already. [gasp] I mean, almost all of us have them already. Don't worry, you two, you're still totally invited to my cute-cea<f1>era this weekend."
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,silver spoon,It's going to be amazing.
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,diamond tiara,It's a party celebrating me and my fantastic cutie mark. How could it not be?
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,Gimme a break.
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,silver spoon,See you this weekend...
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,It's not fair! It's just not fair!
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,applejack,Don't get your mane in a tangle. You'll get your cutie mark. Everypony gets one eventually.
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,"But I don't want one eventually! I want one right now! I can't go to Diamond Tiara's cute-cea<f1>era without one, I just can't!"
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,applejack,"'Course you can. Y'know, I was the last pony in my class to get my cutie mark, and I couldn't be prouder of it. I knew my future was to run Sweet Apple Acres, and these bright shiny apples sealed the deal. [gasp] Come to think of it, Granny Smith was the last one in her class, too. Huh, same as Big McIntosh."
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,"I really don't see how that's supposed to make me feel better. It probably means that being the last one in your class to get a cutie mark runs in the family. ...runs in the family. Runs in the family! Runs in the family! You've got apples for your cutie mark, Granny Smith has an apple pie, Big McIntosh has an apple half, my unique talent must has som'n to do with apples! Apples apples apples! [crash] Oops... apples."
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,applejack,"Get your delicious, nutritious apples here!"
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,Create fine art for your home with 'em. You have to be crazy not to get a bushel of your very own.
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,applejack,"Heh... she's so creative, heh."
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,"You, sir, care t' buy some apples?"
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,Why not?
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,Are you sure?
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,"You're pretty sure, but you're not absolutely positively completely super-duper sure, are you?"
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,All right!
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,applejack,You forgot your change!
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,"Woo-hoo! That's how you sell s'm apples and get a cutie mark! So, what does my cutie mark look like? A shoppin' bag full of apples? A satisfied customer eating an apple? Hmm... maybe I gotta increase my sales figures first. You touch it, you buy it! We take cash or credit."
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,applejack,"I'm sorry, ma'am. Ma'am! Aww... Now Apple Bloom, you can't just..."
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,That'll be four bits.
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,sweetie drops,I didn't put those in my bag.
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,"Likely story. Four bits, lady!"
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,applejack,"Apple Bloom! I am really really sorry about that. She's new. Here, take these. No charge. And these. And these."
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,applejack,"Y'all come back now, y'hear?"
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,What?
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,applejack,"Sorry, little sis, but your apple-sellin' days are over."
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,What? But how else am I gonna get my cutie mark?
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,applejack,Home. Now.
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,Hm!
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,applejack,"Ugh. Listen, sugarcube, I know it's hard to wait for your very own cutie mark, but, you just can't force it. Besides, you're not that grown-up just yet. Ain't there other fillies in your class without one?"
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,Well... Twist doesn't have hers yet.
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,applejack,Do you think you'd feel better if you went to the party with her?
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,Mmm-hmm.
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,applejack,Well there you go. Bet you and Twist would have a great time together. Now run along and find your friend.
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,You're sure you don't want me to stick around 'til the end of th' market?
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,applejack,Yeah. I'm sure.
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,"So I was thinkin'... maybe we could go to Diamond Tiara's cute-cea<f1>era together. I don't have a cutie mark, you don't have a cutie mark."
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,"Yeah, pretty... sweet."
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,diamond tiara,Of course she will.
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,"Whoa, looks like somepony's got a dark cloud hanging over her head. Let me do something about that. What's the matter, kid?"
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,[inhales] There's a cute-cea<f1>era this afternoon and everypony in my class will be there and they'll all have their cutie marks and I wanna get my cutie mark but I'm no good at sellin' apples but I really wanna go to the party but how can I go to the party if I don't have my cutie mark which my big sister says I'm gonna get eventually but... I WANT IT NOW!
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,Applejack says these things take time. I have to just wait for it to happen.
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,Why wait for something to happen when you can make it happen?
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,But Applejack says th...
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,"Hey, who are you gonna listen to, Applejack, or the pony who was first in her class to get a cutie mark? I always liked flying an' all, but I was going nowhere in a hurry. It wasn't until my very first race that I discovered a serious need for speed, and KAZAM, this sweet baby appeared as fast as lightning."
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,"That's right, stretch out those legs. Gotta be nice and loose. The key here is to try as many things as possible as quickly as possible. One of them is bound to lead to your cutie mark. Are you ready?"
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,I'm ready!
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,I said: Are! You! Ready!
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,I'M READY!
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,Ah!
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,Whoa!
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,Hi-ya! Ee...
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,Whoaaa! Whoa...
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,Tried that one... tried that one... tried that one...
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,silver spoon,"Your new outfit is, like, perfect for the party."
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,diamond tiara,I know. It totally shows off my cutie mark.
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,silver spoon,I love being special.
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,diamond tiara,Can you imagine how embarrassing it must be to be... not special?
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,silver spoon,"I don't even want to, like, think about it."
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,Tried that one... tried that one...
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,I'm doomed. Doomed! I'll never find sumth'n I'm good at.
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,You look like you'd be good at eating cupcakes.
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,Eatin' cupcakes?
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,Eating cupcakes?
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,Eating cupcaaakes!
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,"I really appreciate all your help, Rainbow Dash. You're a really great coach and I really learned a lot from you and I'm sure I can learn a lot more but... I've got some cupcakes to eat! See you at the cute-cea<f1>era! Hold on, Pinkie Pie, I'm comin'."
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,"I can't believe I didn't think of this. A cupcake-eating cutie mark, it's sooo obvious. Now, where are those cupcakes? I'm ready t' chow down!"
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,I don't have any cupcakes.
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,Oh.
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,[gasp] But you look like you'd be good at helping me make some.
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,"I guess, uh, making-cupcakes cutie mark could work too."
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,"All you have to do is take a cup of flour! Add it to the mix! Now just take a little something sweet, not sour! A bit of salt, just a pinch!"
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,"[cough] Hot, hot, hot!"
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,"Oooh, those look much better than the last batch. [chomp] Mmm..."
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,"Ugh! I guess I'm not cut out to be a baker either. [sigh] I just have to face it, I'm gonna have a blank flank forever."
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,What about that?
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,"What about what? Is there something on my flank? Is there, is there, is there? [gasp] A cutie mark! It's a... a measuring cup? No. A mixin' bowl? No... Are those cupcakes? A tower of cupcakes maybe."
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,"[blow] Flour. It's flour! Yay! I guessed it. What game you wanna play next? Please say bingo, please say bingo."
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"Whoa, what's been going on in here?"
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,"We've been making cupcakes, wanna try them?"
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"Nnnno thank you... not that they don't look, heh, delicious."
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,"Twilight, you have to help me!"
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,What's the matter?
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,"[inhales] Tiara's cute-cea<f1>era's today and everypony in my class will be there and they'll all have their cutie marks and I want to get my cutie mark but I'm no good at selling apples or hang-gliding or making cupcakes, but I wanna go to the party but how can I go to the party if I don't have my cutie mark, which Pinkie Pie says I can't just make appear, but I need it to appear, right now!"
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Uhhh... I don't follow. How can I help you?
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,You can use your magic to make my cutie mark appear.
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"Oh no, Apple Bloom. A cutie mark is something a pony has to discover for herself."
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,"Please Twilight, jus' trah."
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"I'm sorry, but-"
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,"Oh please, please, please please please!"
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"All right, all right!"
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,Oh thank you thank you thank you. [pwing] Yes! I knew you could do... it.
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"I'm sorry, sweetie, but I told you-"
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,"Try again, try again!"
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Told you that not even magic can make a cutie mark appear before its time.
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,"It's hopeless, hopeless! I just won't go to the party, I can't go. Everyone will just laugh at me and make fun of me and call me names. It will be the worst night of my life."
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,I'm sure it won't be as bad as all that.
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,"Forget it, there's no way I'm going to that [gulp] party."
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,How could I have forgotten the time? How could I have forgotten Pinkie Pie was hosting the party? How could I have forgotten it was at Sugarcube Corner?
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,"Don't forget your party hat, Forgetty Forgetterson!"
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,I have to get out of here before anypony sees me.
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,diamond tiara,"Hey! It's my cute-cea<f1>era, I'm supposed to get the first bite at cake."
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,"Okay, Apple Bloom, almost there."
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,applejack,"Apple Bloom, you made it. After I heard about Twist, I was afraid you wouldn't show up. I sure am glad you came to your senses about this whole cutie mark thing. These things happen when these things are supposed to happen. Trying to rush 'em just drives you crazy. I'll let you be, looks like your friends want to talk to you."
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,diamond tiara,"Well well well, look who's here."
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,silver spoon,Nice outfit.
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,"Just sumt'n I, uh, pulled together last minute."
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,diamond tiara,"It really shows off your cutie mark. Oh wait, that's right, you don't have one."
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,"Uh, I have a cutie mark."
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,silver spoon,"Eh, what? Since when?"
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,Since... Um... Earlier today.
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,diamond tiara,Oh really? Let's see it.
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,"I shouldn't. I couldn't. My cutie mark is so unbelievably amazing, I'm afraid that if I show it off, everyone will start paying attention to me instead of you. Outshined at your own cute-cea<f1>era. Can you imagine how embarrassing that would be?"
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,diamond tiara,"Uh, forget it, I didn't really want to see it anyway."
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,Oh no.
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,silver spoon,"Wow, that is an amazing cutie mark."
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,diamond tiara,Nice try...
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,scootaloo,[offscreen] You got a problem with blank flanks?
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,scootaloo,"I said, you got a problem with blank flanks?"
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,silver spoon,"The problem is, I mean, she's like, totally not special."
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,sweetie belle,"No, it means she's full of potential."
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,scootaloo,"It means she could be great at anything. The possibilities are, [mocking] like, endless."
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,sweetie belle,"She could be a great scientist, or an amazing artist, or a famous writer. She could even be mayor of Ponyville someday."
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,scootaloo,And she's not stuck being stuck-up like you two.
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,diamond tiara,"Hey, this is my party, why are you two on her side?"
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,scootaloo,Because...
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,[gasp] You don't have your cutie marks either? I thought I was the only one.
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,scootaloo,We thought we were the only two.
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,I for one think you are three very lucky fillies.
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,diamond tiara,Lucky? How can they be lucky?
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"They still get to experience the thrill of discovering who they are, and what they're meant to be."
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,applejack,"And they got all the time in the world to figure it out, not just an afternoon."
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,diamond tiara,"Hey, what's everypony doing? This is my party, everypony is supposed to be paying attention to me."
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,silver spoon,"Whatever. We still think you're losers, right, Diamond Tiara? Bump, bump, sugar... lump..."
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,diamond tiara,"Not now, Silver Spoon."
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,scootaloo,Name's Scootaloo.
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,sweetie belle,And I'm Sweetie Belle.
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,Apple Bloom.
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,"So I was thinking, now that we're friends... I mean, we are friends, right?"
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,scootaloo,"How could we not be? We're totally alike. We don't have cutie marks, Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon drive us crazy--"
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,sweetie belle,Totally crazy.
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,"Well, now that we're friends, what if the three of us work together to find out who we are and what we're supposed to be?"
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,sweetie belle,Ooh! Ooh! We could form our own secret society.
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,scootaloo,I'm liking this idea.
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,A secret society. Yeah. We need a name for it though.
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,scootaloo,The Cutie Mark Three?
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,sweetie belle,The Cutastically Fantastics?
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,How about... The Cutie Mark Crusaders?
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,scootaloo,It's perfect!
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,sweetie belle,This is gonna be so great!
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,We're gonna be unstoppable!
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,scootaloo,What do you say we celebrate with some of these delicious cupcakes?
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,Not the cupcakes. Trust me.
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,sweetie belle,Let's see if there are any cookies.
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,Yeah! Come on.
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"Dearest Princess Celestia,"
Call of the Cutie,Meghan McCarthy,princess celestia,...can actually be the thing that helps you make your closest friends and realize how special you are. Hmm...
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,[grunt] Whoo-hoo!
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,Hoo-wee! Not a bad pitch for a pony who works with her head in the clouds.
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,"Oh yeah? Think you can do better, cowgirl?"
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"I know I can. [grunt] Oh, for Pete's sake!"
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,Heh! Looks like this Pegasus can pitch better than the workhorse. The object of the game is to get the closest to the stake.
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"All right, all right. You got another throw there, pony girl."
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"[sarcastically] Wow, Rainbow, heh. You couldn't hit a barn door with that kind of a throw!"
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,"Yeah, yeah. I still have the closest throw, Applesmack. Just try and beat it."
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,[grunt] Yee-haw! It's a ringer. That's how you do it down here on the farm.
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,I lost.
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"Ah, don't feel bad, Rainbow. It's all in good fun."
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,I hate losing.
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"Besides, you're a mighty good athlete. I'm just better. Heh heh heh."
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,"All right, Applejack, you think you're the top athlete in all of Ponyville?"
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"Well, I was gonna say in all of Equestria, but that might be gildin' the lily."
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,...and I think I'm the top athlete. So let's prove it.
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,Prove what?
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,"I challenge you to an Iron Pony competition. A series of athletic contests to decide who's the best, once and for all."
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"You know what, Rainbow? You're on."
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"So you two are doing what, now?"
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,An Iron<U+0097>
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,Iron Pony competition.
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"See, we've set up a bunch of events to decide which one of us is<U+0097>"
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,And I'm here to...?
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,[grunt] I don't know. Why is she here?
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,To be our judge and keep score.
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,spike,"Hello everypony, and welcome to the first annual Iron Pony competition!"
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"Uh, Spike, who are you talking to?"
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,spike,"Um... Uh, them! Let the games begin!"
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,Ready. Set. Go!
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,[gasp] Dagnabbit.
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"Time, Spike?"
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,spike,17 seconds.
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,You're kiddin'! That breaks my record from last year's rodeo.
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,spike,But you got a five second penalty for nudging the barrel.
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"[sigh] Nuts and chews! Still, that's 22 seconds. Not too shabby. Hey, don't be nervous. Remember, it's all in good fun. Now git on up there."
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,Ready. Set. Go!
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"Woo! That was some fancy hoofwork there, Rainbow!"
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,"Thanks, but I [pant] couldn't have been as fast as you."
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"What was the time on that, Spike?"
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,spike,18 seconds!
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"18 seconds. Rainbow, are you sure you're not secretly a rodeo pony?"
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,Rainbow Dash wins the barrel lead!
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,"Oh, I can't believe I won."
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"Yeah, well, don't you go gettin' used to it."
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,Years of applebuckin'.
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,Ugh.
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,granny smith,Waa-hoo!
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,apple bloom,Whoo-hoo!
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,big mcintosh,Eeyup!
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,spike,Why me?
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,Go!
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,spike,Whoa! Whoa! Whoa-hoa! Whoa! Whoaaa! Ouch.
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,Ready for another pony ride?
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,spike,No.
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,Go!
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,spike,Guh guh guh guh guh guh guh guh guh guh guh guhwhoaaaaaa!
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,Rainbow Dash wins the bronco-buck.
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,spike,And I lose.
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,spike,Whoa! [grunt] How do I get roped into these things?
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,[grunt] Does this count?
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,[grunt] Wah!
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,Yeah.
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,spike,"Fillies and gentlecolts, at the halfway point, our competitors are tied at five and five."
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,Who are you talking to?
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,spike,Them!
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"95, 96, 97, 98, 99... a hundred!"
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,Yes!
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"Be a good sport, Applejack."
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"All right, you two. This is the final event. Give it all you've got."
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,spike,Looks like the workhorse might come out ahead in this one.
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,[mumbling] That's not fair. You can't use your wings to help you win.
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,Huh?
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,[mumbling] You're cheatin'!
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,I can't understand you with that rope in your mouth.
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,Whoo-hoo! I win by a landslide... or mudslide in your case. [chuckles] I am the Iron Pony!
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,Only 'cause you cheated.
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,What?
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,You used your wingpower to help you win over half those contests.
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,Sounds like sour apples to me.
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,Are you sayin' you didn't use your wings?
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,Well... no. But you never said I couldn't use my wings.
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,I didn't think I needed to tell you to play fair.
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,I still would have won even without my wings.
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,Hah! Prove it.
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,Gladly. How?
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,Tomorrow is the annual Runnin' of the Leaves. I challenge you to race me in it.
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,Heh! Easy shmeasy.
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"Hold on! There is one condition: the point is to run, so no wings allowed."
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,No wings? No problem.
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,spike,"Twilight, hurry up, we're gonna be late for the race."
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,Why are you so excited about the race? It's only for ponies.
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,spike,"Yeah, but I'm hoping I can be the announcer again. Just listen: Fillies and gentlecolts, welcome to the annual Running of the--"
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"Welcome to the annual Running of the Leaves! This is Pinkie Pie, your official p-eye-in-the-sky announcer."
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"Sorry, Spike. I guess that job's already taken."
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"As everypony knows, the Running is a very important tradition, for without it, the autumn leaves of Equestria would never fall. So get ready, ponies. The Running of the Leaves will begin in five minutes."
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,"Pardon me, excuse me. Make way for the Iron Pony."
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"The Iron Phony, you mean."
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,"So, Applejack, you ready to win second place?"
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"I'm ready to run a good, clean race."
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,"Yeah, yeah..."
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,You are not allowed to use your wings.
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,I could win this race with both wings tied behind my back.
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"[grunts] Trussed up like a turkey. Well, a turkey who can't fly, that is."
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,Very funny.
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,'Least now we know we're racin' fair and square.
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,Racers! Please take your positions!
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,spike,Um... Pinkie Pie?
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,spike,"Uh, yeah. I know you're doing the announcing today and stuff and... I'm sure you're gonna do a great job and all, but... I was just wondering..."
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,What?
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,spike,Aw... Forget it.
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,Spike! Would you like to be my co-reporter? We could comment on the action together.
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,spike,We could?
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,Climb on up.
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,Twilight? What in tarnation are you doin' up here?
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,I'm racing.
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,"[laughs] Good one, Twilight."
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,I'm not joking.
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,"What? You're not an athlete, you're a... well... you're an egghead."
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"I am not an egghead, I am well-read."
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,[softly] Egghead.
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,[snickers] But have you ever run a race?
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"Well, no, but I do know a lot about running."
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,And you know this from...
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,Books. I've read several on the subject.
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,"What'd you read, ""The Egghead's Guide to Running""? Did you stretch out your eye muscles to warm up? [laugh] Get it? Eye muscles."
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"Scoff if you must, Rainbow. But the Running of the Leaves is a Ponyville tradition, and since I'm here to learn, I've decided I should experience it myself."
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,Yeah. See you at the finish line... Tomorrow.
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"All right, ponies, are you ready?"
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,spike,Get set.
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,And they're off!
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"Welcome to the official coverage of the Running of the Leaves! You know, Spike, despite its name, the leaves don't do any of the actual running. No, that's left to my little ponies."
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,spike,"Why, yes, Pinkie, it's the running of the ponies that causes the leaves to fall."
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"Ugh. Those lazy, lazy leaves. But this year, the run is about more than the weather. It's about the race to the finish and the two runners who want to win it: Applejack and Rainbow Dash."
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,spike,"You know, Pinkie, these two ponies have a bit of a grudge match they're trying to settle. Trying to prove who's the most athletic."
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"Yes, and ""grudge"" rhymes with ""fudge""."
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,spike,"Yes, it... does. What?"
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,And I like fudge. But if I eat too much fudge I get a pudge and then I can't budge.
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,spike,So... no fudge?
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"Oh, no thanks. I had a big breakfast. Let's check in with our two competitive ponies, Applejack and Rainbow Dash. Having come fast out of the gate, Applejack and Rainbow Dash are evenly matched running neck and neck. But what's this? Applejack is making a move, she's now ahead by a nose. But Rainbow Dash won't let Applejack have it and takes the lead. She's ahead by half a nose. Or maybe three quarters of a nose. No, about sixty-three point seven percent of a nose... roughly speaking. Applejack sees this move and pushes forth with her strong workhorse legs slinking ahead by three hundred and fifty noses!"
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"Not so easy without wings, is it?"
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,"Come on, Rainbow. Show 'em a little dash."
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,spike,"Ho-hold your horses, Pinkie! Rainbow Dash is catching up the frontrunner Applejack!"
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,What an upset. I thought Applejack had this in the bag.
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,"You didn't think I was gonna let you off that easily, did you?"
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,Whoa! I don't believe it.
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"I know, it's beautiful, isn't it?"
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"Not the scenery, Twilight. Rainbow Dash just tripped me."
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,She did not.
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,She did too!
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"She did not, and if you slowed down and looked where you're going, like me, you'd see that you tripped over a rock."
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"What? Oh, hayseed! Now I got a lot of ground to make up to catch Rainbow."
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,Just be careful!
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,See you at the finish line!
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,spike,"I don't believe it. After a huge setback, Applejack is back at the front of the pack."
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"She's the head of the pack, all right. The pick of the litter! The cat's pajamas! Oh wait, why would Applejack take some poor kitty's PJs? That's not very sporting of her."
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,spike,Oookay... Let's get back to the race.
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,"Not so fast, Applejack! This race isn't over yet!"
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,It is for you. Heh.
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,"Whoa! Guh, I don't believe it, Applejack tripped me."
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,Don't you ponies ever look where you're going? You tripped on a stump. See?
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,"Oh, I see. A big cheater is what I see."
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"Rainbow, Applejack would never cheat. It was just an accident."
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,"Sure it was. I mean, yeah, I'm sure it was."
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"Remember, Rainbow, this is just a game."
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,"Yes, but the rules have changed, and two can play at that game."
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"Welcome back, Ponyvillians, it's me, Pinkie Pie."
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,spike,And Spike. Looks like Rainbow is doing her best to catch up.
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"I'm not sure how ketchup is going to help her in this contest. Now, in a hot dog eating contest it can make them doggies nice and slippery, but personally, I prefer mustard. How about you, Spike?"
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,spike,Uh... I... like... pickles?
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,Aaand it looks like Applejack has found herself in quite a pickle as Rainbow overtakes her.
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,"Look, ma, no wings."
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,spike,"As the racers enter Equestria's Whitetail Wood, Rainbow Dash is back in the lead."
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"Ugh. Hey, Rainbow!"
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"[gasp] Why, that little cheater did that on purpose. It's on."
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,"Nice one, Rainbow."
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,Later!
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,[gasp] Aaa!
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"Oh my, Whitetail Wood is just lovely. Hey, Rainbow, shouldn't you be up ahead?"
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,[chuckling] I'm sure I'll win now.
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,Except that the other racers just passed you.
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,Oh horse apples... See ya!
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"Applejack, what are you doing up here?"
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,spike,There aren't even any trees.
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"Er, no, but the sign's pointed this way... Rainbow. Mind giving me a lift?"
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,What the hay?! You said no flying!
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"No, I said no wings."
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"I must say, Spike, that this has been the most interesting Running of the Leaves in Equestria history!"
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,spike,With the most interesting announcing.
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,But it isn't the running that's been fascinating. It's the lack of running!
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,[grunt] Aaa!
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,Whoa!
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,Whoa!
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"Forgive me, girls. I know I'm not an athlete, but shouldn't the Running of the Leaves actually involve running?"
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,"You know, I think Twilight's right."
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,You do?
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,"Yeah! If you wanna beat me, you better... RUUUN!"
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"Once again, Rainbow Dash and Applejack are neck and neck, jockeying for position. Applejack inches ahead, now it's Rainbow, it's Applejack, it's Rainbow Dash, it's Applejack--"
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,spike,"Oh no, she di'int!"
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"Oh yes, she di'id!"
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,Cut it out!
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,"No, you cut it out!"
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,You started it.
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,And now I'm gonna finish it.
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"Oh no, you won't."
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,"Oh yes, I will. [grunt] That's it! All bets are off!"
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"Oh no, you don't."
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"It's Applejack, it's Rainbow Dash, it's Applejack, it's Rainbow Dash--"
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,I won!
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"No, I won!"
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,I won!
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,spike,You tied!
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,For first?
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,For last!
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,Last?!
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,Then who won?
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"Oh no, but I did get fifth place, which is rather good considering I've never run a race before."
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,What? How's that even possible?
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,"You ran so slow, and looked at the scenery."
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"Exactly. I paced myself, just like my book said. Then at the end, when all the other ponies were worn out, I sprinted to the finish."
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,I don't believe it. Twilight beat us.
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"Well, with all your horsing around, it was quite easy."
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"You're right, Twilight. Our behavior was just terrible."
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,We weren't very good sports.
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,princess celestia,Sounds to me that an important lesson was learned.
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,W-What are you doin' here?
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,princess celestia,"Fall is one of my favorite seasons, so I came to celebrate the Running of the Leaves."
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"I'm sorry you had to see us being such poor sports, Princess."
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,princess celestia,"That's all right, Applejack. Anypony can get swept up in the excitement of competition."
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,It's important to remember that the friendship is always more important than the competition.
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,princess celestia,"Exactly, Twilight. Now, unfortunately, because the two of you were busy tricking each other instead of shaking down leaves, many of the lovely trees of Equestria are still covered."
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"Why, Princess, I bet we can knock those leaves down for you lickety-split. Whaddya say, friend? Wanna go for another run?"
Fall Weather Friends,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,I'd love to stretch my legs.
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,rarity,"Oh, Opalescence. Can't you just picture it? Moi, stepping out in a stunning new gown at the Grand Galloping Gala in Canterlot!"
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,rarity,"Why, yes! I did make it myself. Thank you so much for asking."
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,rarity,"Oh, Opal, of course you can help me. Thank you. What's that? You want to help me more? Oh, aren't you the sweetest thing? Careful now. Don't move. This shouldn't take long at all."
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,applejack,"Howdy, Rarity!"
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,twilight sparkle,Shh... Can't you see Rarity is trying to concentrate?
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,applejack,What do you think she's makin'?
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,twilight sparkle,Looks like a dress.
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,applejack,"Well, that makes sense. Since this is a dressmaker's shop and all."
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,rarity,Is there something I can help you with?
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,twilight sparkle,"Oh, so very sorry to trouble you, Rarity, but I need a quick favor. Could you please fix the button for me? It's my dress for the Grand Galloping Gala."
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,rarity,"Oh, no, no, no! You can't wear this... old thing. You need a glamorous new outfit for the Gala and I'll make it for you. No problem at all. It will be my pleasure!"
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,twilight sparkle,"Oh, that's really sweet of you to offer, Rarity, but I can't let you do that. It would be so much work. This dress is fine."
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,rarity,Twilight Sparkle. I insist on making you a new dress.
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,twilight sparkle,But...
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,rarity,Not another word! I won't take no for an answer.
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,twilight sparkle,"Well, in that case... Thank you for your generosity, Rarity. Knowing your handiwork, I'm sure it will be absolutely beautiful."
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,rarity,"Let me guess, Applejack. You don't want a new gown either."
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,applejack,Gown? Shoot. I was just gonna wear my old work duds.
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,rarity,"You can't possibly be serious, Applejack! You absolutely must wear formal attire."
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,applejack,Hm... Nah.
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,rarity,What if I just spruce up your... duds for you a little bit?
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,applejack,"Okay, sure. Why not? Since you're up for it and all. Just don't make them too... frou-frou-y."
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,rarity,Deal!
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,rainbow dash,Look out below!
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,rainbow dash,Sorry. New trick. Didn't quite work.
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,rarity,"Hmm... [gasp] Idea! I'll make you an outfit for the Gala too, Rainbow Dash."
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,rainbow dash,Outfit for the what now?
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,rarity,"I'll make one for you and you and all of you. Oh! And of course Pinkie and Fluttershy too. Oh, and when I'm done, we can hold our very own fashion show!"
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,twilight sparkle,What a great idea! If you're sure you can handle it.
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,rarity,"Oh, it'll be a little bit of work, but it will be a wonderful boost for my business. Plus, fun!"
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,rainbow dash,"Oh, I love fun things!"
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,rarity,Then it's settled. We'll have a fashion show starring us.
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,applejack,"So all you have to do is make a different, stunning, original, amazing outfit for one, two, three, four, five... plus yourself, six ponies? And lickety split?"
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,rarity,"Oh, Applejack. You make it sound as if it's going to be hard."
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,rarity,"Thread by thread, stitching it together Twilight's dress, cutting out the pattern snip by snip Making sure the fabric folds nicely It's the perfect color and so hip Always gotta keep in mind my pacing Making sure the clothes' correctly facing I'm stitching Twilight's dress"
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,rarity,"That's it. Keep them closed. Don't look. Okay, you can look now!"
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,rarity,"These are your new outfits. What do you think of your old duds now, Applejack? Pretty swanky, are they not? And Twilight! I made this dress for you and I designed each outfit theme to perfectly reflect each pony's unique personality. Oh, it took me forever to get the colors right on this one, Rainbow Dash, but I did it. Oh, and it turned out beautiful, don't you think? And I know you are going to love yours, Fluttershy. It just sings spring! And Pinkie Pie, look! Pink! Your favorite! Aren't they all amazing?"
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,twilight sparkle,Wow... They're...
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,rainbow dash,"Yeah, they're..."
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,applejack,They sure are... somethin'.
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,twilight sparkle,Yes! Something.
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,pinkie pie,I love something! Something is my favorite!
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,fluttershy,It's... nice.
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,rarity,But what's the matter? Don't you like them?
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,twilight sparkle,They're very nice...
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,applejack,And we're plumb grateful 'cause you worked so hard on them.
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,rainbow dash,Mine's just not as cool as I was imagining. She asked.
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,twilight sparkle,I guess what we're all saying is that they're just not what we had in mind.
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,rarity,"That's okay. Not a problem. There's plenty more where that came from. They were only a first pass. You're my friends and I want you to be 110% satisfied. Not to worry, I'll redo them."
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,fluttershy,"Oh, Rarity. You don't have to do that. They're fine."
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,rarity,I want them to be better than just fine. I want you to think they're absolutely perfect.
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,applejack,"Are you sure? I mean, we wouldn't wanna impose."
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,rarity,"Oh, it's no imposition. Really, I insist."
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,twilight sparkle,"Well, in that case... Thank you again, Rarity."
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,rarity,What have I gotten myself into?
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,fluttershy,"Hello? You wanted to see me, Rarity?"
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,rarity,Fluttershy! Your new-new gown's ready. I completely revised it and I know you're going to love it. What do you think?
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,fluttershy,I... love it.
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,rarity,"Oh, you're just saying that."
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,fluttershy,"No, no. I do. It's... nice."
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,rarity,"""Nice""?"
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,fluttershy,Nice.
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,rarity,"If you don't like it, you should just tell me."
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,fluttershy,"Oh, but I do like it."
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,rarity,Like it or love it?
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,fluttershy,Um... both?
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,rarity,Which is it?
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,fluttershy,"Please stop asking me this, I..."
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,rarity,"Well, just tell me what you really think."
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,fluttershy,"No, that's okay..."
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,rarity,Tell me.
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,fluttershy,No... it's fine...
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,rarity,Tell me!
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,fluttershy,I... like it...
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,rarity,"Tell me, tell me, tell-me-tell-me-tell-me!"
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,fluttershy,"All right! Since you really wanna know... [inhales] The armscye's tight, the middy collar doesn't go with the shawl lapel, the hems are clearly machine-stitched, the pleats are uneven, the fabric looks like toile, you used a backstitch here when it clearly called for a topstitch or maybe a traditional blanket stitch, and the overdesign is reminiscent of pr<ea>t-<e0>-porter and not true French haute couture. [pauses] But, uh... you know... um, whatever you want to do is fine."
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,twilight sparkle,"Now, the stars on my belt need to be technically accurate. Orion has three stars on his belt, not four."
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,rarity,"Stitch by stitch, stitching it together Deadline looms, don't you know the client's always right? Even if my fabric choice was perfect Gotta get them all done by tonight Pinkie Pie, that color's too obtrusive Wait until you see it in the light I'm sewing them together!"
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,pinkie pie,"Don't you think my gown would be more ""me"" with some lollipops?"
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,rarity,"Well, I think..."
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,pinkie pie,Balloons?
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,rarity,Well...
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,pinkie pie,Do it!
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,rarity,"Hour by hour, one more change I'm sewing them together, take great pains Fluttershy, you're putting me in a bind Rainbow Dash, what is on your mind? Oh my gosh, there's simply not much time Don't forget, Applejack's duds must shine"
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,twilight sparkle,"That constellation is Canis Major, not Minor."
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,fluttershy,"French haute couture, please."
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,rarity,Ugh...
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,applejack,What if it rains? Galoshes!
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,pinkie pie,"More balloons! Oh no, that's too many balloons. More candy! Oh, less candy. Oh wait, I know. Streamers!"
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,rarity,Streamers?
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,pinkie pie,Whose dress is this?
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,rarity,Streamers it is.
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,rainbow dash,What?
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,rarity,Aren't you going to tell me to change something too?
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,rainbow dash,"No, I just want my dress to be cool."
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,rarity,Do you not like the color?
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,rainbow dash,"The color's fine, just make it look cooler."
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,rarity,Do you not like the shape?
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,rainbow dash,"The shape's fine, just make the whole thing... you know, cooler. It needs to be about 20% cooler."
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,pinkie pie,All we ever want is indecision
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,rainbow dash,All we really like is what we know
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,twilight sparkle,Gotta balance style with adherence
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,fluttershy,Making sure we make a good appearance
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,applejack,Even if you simply have to fudge it
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,rarity,"Got to overcome intimidation Remember, it's all in the presentation!"
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,rarity,"Oh, Opal. These are the ugliest dresses I've ever made."
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,rarity,Okay. I did exactly what each of you asked for. Now don't hold back. Let me know what you really think.
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,twilight sparkle,Oh my!
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,fluttershy,It's... perfect!
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,rainbow dash,It's cool!
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,applejack,"Why, they're the best duds I ever did see."
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,twilight sparkle,"Thank you, Rarity."
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,pinkie pie,Are you as happy with them as we are? Huh? Huh? Huh?
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,rarity,"Well, I'm... happy that all of you are happy. I'm just relieved to finally be done."
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,spike,You are never gonna believe this! You've heard of Hoity Toity?
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,twilight sparkle,The bigwig fashion hotshot in Canterlot?
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,spike,"Uh-huh. He heard about your fashion show. Well, maybe I happened to mention it to him... He's coming here all the way from Canterlot to see your work, Rarity!"
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,applejack,"Whoa, Nelly! You could sell a ton o' dresses to this guy. Your business will be boomin'!"
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,twilight sparkle,Wow!
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,rainbow dash,That's so cool!
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,pinkie pie,I don't believe it!
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,rarity,Hoity Toity? He's coming here? To see THESE dresses?
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,spike,Yep! Get ready for all of your dreams to come true.
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,rarity,"Oh. [gasp] There he is! [deep breaths] Okay. Relax, Rarity. Your friends like their outfits and so will he. [squeals] What's wrong with the lights?! Oh, yes. That means the show's starting. Good."
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,spike,"Since the beginning of time, the elite of Equestria have longed for pony fashions that truly expressed the essence of their very souls. Patiently waiting decades -- no, centuries -- for the perfect pony gown. Today, at long last, Equestria, your wait is over! Let's hear it for the breathtaking designs of Ponyville's own Rarity!"
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,applejack,Why's everypony lookin' at us like that?
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,twilight sparkle,Oh dear.
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,rainbow dash,You think we overdid it?
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,applejack,"Nah. [pause] Okay, maybe a little."
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,hoity toity,"Oh, those amateurish designs look like a piled-on mishmash of everything but a kitchen sink! It's a travesty is what it is. Those outfits are the ugliest things I've ever seen, oh for shame. Who is responsible for subjecting our eyes to these horrors? Not to mention wasting my valuable time."
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,spike,"Come on out and take a bow, Rarity. You worked really hard for this. Yes! All right, woo-hoo! Go, Rarity!"
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,pinkie pie,Rarity? You okay in there? You haven't come out for days.
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,twilight sparkle,"You're not a laughing stock, Rarity..."
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,rainbow dash,She kind of is.
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,twilight sparkle,Shhh! Come on out and talk to us.
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,rarity,"[sobbing] Leave me alone! I vant to be alone! I want to wallow in... whatever it is that ponies are supposed to wallow in! Do ponies wallow in pity? Oh, listen to me, I don't even know what I'm supposed to wallow in! I'm so pathetic!"
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,twilight sparkle,Now what do we do?
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,fluttershy,Uh... panic?
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,rainbow dash,That's your answer for everything!
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,applejack,"Well, we can't just leave Rarity like this."
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,pinkie pie,She'll become a crazy cat lady!
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,twilight sparkle,She only has one cat.
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,pinkie pie,Give her time.
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,rarity,"Exile... I guess technically I'd have to move away to live in exile. Where would I go? And what would I pack? Oh, it's going to take me forever to do all of that packing. What are you supposed to pack when you go to exile? Are you supposed to pack warm?"
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,rarity,Huh? Opal?
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,rarity,"Opal, how did you get up there? Hang on, you poor dear! Mama's coming!"
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,rarity,Rainbow Dash?! How dare you strand my poor Opal in a tree?
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,rainbow dash,"Well, how else were we gonna get you out here to show you this?"
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,pinkie pie,We all finished your dress for you.
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,applejack,Thanks to Fluttershy's freaky knowledge of sewing.
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,fluttershy,Do you like it?
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,rarity,Like it? Like it?!
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,fluttershy,Uh-uh. She doesn't like it.
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,rarity,"No, I don't like it."
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,rarity,I love it!
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,rarity,You ponies did an amazing job. It's exactly the way I imagined it.
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,fluttershy,We just followed your brilliant design.
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,twilight sparkle,Like we should have let you do for our outfits. Those first dresses you designed were perfect.
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,pinkie pie,We're so super sorry.
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,rainbow dash,You worked really hard to make our dresses exactly the way we wanted them. We all saw how well that turned out.
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,rarity,"Oh, I forgive you."
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,applejack,"Well, that's mighty big of you."
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,rarity,But my whole career is still ruined!
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,applejack,"Oh, right. That."
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,twilight sparkle,Maybe not.
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,hoity toity,"All right, I haven't got all day."
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,hoity toity,Take two.
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,hoity toity,"Hello... Oh, this can't be the same designer."
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,hoity toity,"Simply magnificent! And I suddenly have a fierce craving for some Dutch apple pie, candied apples on a stick, apple turnovers, apple cobbler..."
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,hoity toity,Brilliant!
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,hoity toity,"Oh, spectacular!"
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,hoity toity,"Now this is a fashion show! All of these dresses are absolutely amazing. Who is responsible? Step forward, show yourself!"
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,hoity toity,Brava! Brava! Magnifico! Encore!
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,rarity,"Oh, thank you. Thank you! Oh, thank you so much!"
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,twilight sparkle,"Dear Princess Celestia,"
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,hoity toity,"Rarity, my congratulations to you on a most impressive fashion debut. Would you do me the great honor of allowing me to feature your couture in my Best of the Best Boutique in Canterlot?"
Suited For Success,Charlotte Fullerton,hoity toity,"Now, I'll need you to make a dozen of each dress for me by next Tuesday."
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,Tuh! Nuh! Uh! Nyuh!
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"Eyes over here, Spike!"
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,spike,"Uh, sorry."
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"For this to work, it's crucial we keep our concentration totally on the-"
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,Ooh!
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,spike,Nyuh!
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,Spike! This magic needs our full attention to make it happen. There's no other way!
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,spike,I can't help it. Look!
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"Ugh, never mind her. She's just being Pinkie Pie."
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,spike,Super-extra Pinkie Pie today.
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,Hmm... Twitchy twitcha twitcha twitch.
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"Pinkie Pie? What in the wide, wide world of Equestria are you up to?"
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,Oh! It's my tail! It's my tail! It's a-twitch a-twitchin'! And you know what that means!
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"Actually, Pinkie, I haven't the slightest idea."
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,The twitchin' means my Pinkie Sense is telling me that stuff's gonna start falling! You two better duck for cover.
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"Oh, Pinkie, it's not gonna rain. Why, there's barely even a cloud in the-ugh!"
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,"He just said ""nice catch"" in Frog."
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,fluttershy,"Oh, I'm so, so sorry. You okay, Twilight Sparkle? I just couldn't stand to see the pond getting so over-populated, what with the frogs all hopping into each other and all, so I decided to fly as many as I can on over to Froggy Bottom Bogg."
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,Of course you did.
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,fluttershy,[muffled] Bye-bye!
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,Um... Twilight? You gotta little somethin' on your face there.
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"Oh, really? Did your Pinkie Sense tell you that, too?"
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,Nah! I could just see it. La-la-la-la-la...
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"C'mon, Spike, let's continue our practice session where there's a little less commotion."
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,spike,"Wow! That was amazing! Pinkie Pie predicted something would fall, and it did!"
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"Oh, come on. She said that something would fall, and a frog just happened to fall right around the same time. A coincidence, nothing else to it."
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,My tail! My tail! Twitch-a-twitch! Twitch-a-twitch! Somethin' else is gonna fall!
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"Oh, Pinkie, please. Nothing else is gonna fa-aaah!"
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,spike,"Oh no, Twilight fell! Is it... safe to go help her?"
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,"It's okay, my tail stopped twitching. La-la-la-la-la, la-la-la..."
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,spike,Ha ha! That was amazing!
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"Oh, please."
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,applejack,"Uh, Twilight? Why are you hanging out in a ditch?"
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,spike,"Because, Pinkie Pie predicted it!"
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"Honestly, Spike, she did not. Two coincidences in a row like this may be unlikely, but it's still easier to believe than twitchy tails that predict the future."
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,applejack,[gasp] Twitchy tail? Pinkie Sense? Whoa! Nyu-uh!
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,spike,"Don't worry, it's safe. Prediction already came true."
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"Oh, wait. Don't tell me you believe in this stuff, too?"
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,applejack,"I know it doesn't make much sense, but those of us who have been in Ponyville a while, have learned over time that, if Pinkie's a-twichin', you better listen."
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,My ears are flopping! My ears are flopping!
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,spike,Nyuh! What does that mean?!
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,I'll start a bath for you.
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,Huh? [chuckles] A bath? This thing keeps on getting more ridiculous by the minute!
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,Phhhhft.
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,"Sooo, basically, it works like this: I get different, little, niggly feelings and they mean different things. Like when my back is itchy, it means it's my lucky day. And, when my knee gets pinchy, that means something scary's about to happen."
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,Is your knee pinchy now?
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,"No, but my shoulder's achy. That means there's an alligator in the tub."
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"[scream] How come your knee didn't get pinchy?! That isn't just scary, it's downright dangerous!"
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,"No, it's not, silly! This is my pet alligator, Gummy. He's got no teeth. See? Haha!"
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"Okay, okay... I get it."
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"Well, I still don't believe all this... ""special power"" stuff. It's just a bunch of mumbo-jumbo."
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,"What's not to believe? You do magic, what's the difference?"
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"Huge! For one thing, [clears throat] magic is something you study and practice. It only happens when you decide to do it, and it's meant to make something specific that you choose to happen, happen. With you, uh, it makes no sense at all!"
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,"That's so not true, Twilight! Sometimes it's a bunch of random things happening to my body at random times that supposedly predict the future. I call 'em ""combos""."
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,Combos?
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,"Sure! You know, like, ear flop, then knee twitch, then eye flutter. That means the sky is about to be graced with a beautiful rainbow!"
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"Yeah, sure."
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,"Uh-oh, I feel a combo coming on. Ear flop, eye flutter, knee twitch!"
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,Ugh!
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"Ughhh... You said that combo meant ""beautiful rainbow""."
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,"Oh no-no-no-no-no. You're thinking of an ear flop, then knee twitch, then eye flutter. This was an ear flop, then eye flutter, then knee twitch. That usually means ""look out for opening doors"". You okay?"
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,I don't believe this.
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,You don't believe because you don't understand.
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,Hmm...
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"Okay. Now when you get another twitch, we'll have all kinds of scientific information."
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,Okie-dokie-lokie!
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,Any twitches yet?
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,Nopey-dopey!
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,Now? Anything?
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,"Wait! Hold on! Uhh, no."
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"Are you kidding me?! After a whole day of nonstop twitching, now that I've got you all hooked up, you're not getting a single one?"
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,"I don't control it, they just come and go."
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,That makes no sense!
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,"Sometimes you just have to believe in things, even when you can't figure 'em out."
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,I will not believe in anything I cannot explain.
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,"Wait, hold on, I'm feeling something..."
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"Oh my gosh, what? What is it?!"
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,It's my tummy! That usually means I'm hungry! Let's eat!
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,Urgh... You know what? [bite] [snap] Just forget it! I don't need to know if this is real or not. I don't need to understand it! I don't even care!
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,Okie-dokie-lokie. [gasp] Uh-oh. [gasp] Hu-bu-bu-bu-buh!
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,spike,Pinkie? Have you seen Twilight?
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,Uh-huh.
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,spike,Twilight? What are ya doing back there?
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,Rrrrgh... Did you two plan this?
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,spike,Plan what?
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,Urgh! This is ridiculous. This can't be happening. This makes no sense. I have to figure this out.
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,spike,Twilight?
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,Ah!
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,spike,Whoa-oh-uh!
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"Honestly, Spike, don't you know better than to sneak up on ponies?"
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,spike,"Oh, sorry, but, um, well, isn't that what you're doing?"
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"[gasp] No! I'm doing scientific research. I'm observing Pinkie Pie, scientific name: Pinkius Pieicus, in its natural habitat."
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,spike,Pinkius-whoicus? Hh!
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"There's something fishy going on with the whole twitchy prediction thing, and I'm getting to the bottom of it. So, shh. Come on, Pinkius Pieicus is on the move."
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,Hm... Itchy nose...
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"Aha! That makes no sense. See? She's hiding like something's about to fall from the sky, but a twitchy tail means something's gonna fall from the sky, not an itchy nose."
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,This proves...
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"...perhaps conclusively, that<U+0097>"
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,spike,Gah!
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,Spike! Where are you going? I'm trying to teach you the value of scientific<U+0097>
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,spike,What's she doing now?
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,Smelling a flower.
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,spike,Holy guacamole! I wonder what that means?
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"Probably that the flower smells good. Wait. I'm getting something. Ear flop, eye flutter, knee twitch."
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,spike,"Hold on... You told me that's the combo that says ""watch out for opening doors""!"
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"Oh-ho. You really, really believe this stuff, don't you? Here, let me show you there's nothing to be afraid of. You see? I promise you there's nothing to fear from that<U+0097> Wo-o-ah! Ow! Ugh! Ow! Ow!"
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,applejack,"Twilight! You came to visit my new apple cellar, how nice. Twi? You okay? Uh, Twi?"
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,spike,"Here, let me help you."
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"Okay, take this down: twitchy tail."
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,spike,Twitchy tail? [gasp] Twitchy tail!
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"Hush, Spike! We can't let Pinkie know we're here, remember?"
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,spike,"Something's gonna fall, something's gonna fall! Run for your lives. Ah-ha-ha!"
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"Ugh, Spike honestly, you're overreact<U+0097>"
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,Ugh!
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,"[humming] Hey, Applejack. Whatcha doin'?"
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,applejack,"Takin' more apples to my new apple cellar. How 'bout you, Pinkie? Whatchu doin'?"
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,"Oh, letting Twilight secretly follow me all day without me knowing."
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,You mean you knew all along?! Why didn't you tell me?
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,"[giggles] Silly, that would've spoiled the secret!"
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,Urgh!
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,spike,Tail... still twitching?
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,"All done, clear skies from here on in, as far as I can tell<U+0097> Hu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu!"
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,spike,Oh no! What does that one mean?
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,"Dunno, never gotten any like it before, but whatever that shudder's about, it's a doozy. Something you'd never expect to happen is gonna happen! Hu-bu-bu-bu-bu hu-bu-bu-bu! And it's gonna happen... at Froggy Bottom Bogg!"
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,applejack,[gasp] That's where Fluttershy's headed!
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,spike,Oh no! Is it about her?
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,"Uh, I'm not sure."
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,applejack,We better go and make sure she's okay.
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"Calm down, everypony. All we know right now is that Pinkie Pie just got a case of the shivers. That's all."
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,spike,Guh<U+0097> Hey! I thought you didn't believe in this stuff?
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,I don't. I just want to be there to see the look on Pinkie's face when we find out nothing's wrong.
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,Okie-dokie!
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,[shivers] Hu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu!
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,Cold? Need a jacket or something?
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,"No thanks, I'm fine. [shivers] Hu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu!"
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,spike,So... Whadda'ya think happened to Fluttershy?
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,applejack,I hope nothin'.
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,spike,"I know, but, whadda'ya think happened?"
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,applejack,I'm tryin' not to think about it.
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,spike,"Me too. But I'm thinkin' about it anyway. Like, what if she exploded?"
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,applejack,Just exploded? For no reason?
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,spike,"Yeah, like boom!"
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,Whoa!
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,spike,I know.
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,"What if... What if she exploded, and then... and then exploded again!?"
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,spike,Can you do that? Can you explode twice?
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,applejack,Of course not.
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,spike,"But what if she exploded, and exploded again, and then<U+0097> ugh!"
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"Will you two stop? She's fine, I'm sure of it."
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,applejack,"I hope you're right, for Fluttershy's sake. Look! There's Froggy Bottom Bogg!"
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,applejack,Fluttershy?
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,spike,Fluttershy! You're okay!
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,fluttershy,Of course.
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,applejack,"Phew, what a relief."
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,I'm so glad everything's all right.
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"Sorry, I know it's not nice to gloat but... Aha! I told you there was nothing to worry about, and I was right. Pinkie Pie said whatever she was shuddering about was a [cough] doozy, and [cough] and the only [cough] doozy here is how right I am."
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,applejack,Um... Twilight?
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"Pinkie's made a lot of predictions today but [cough] ugh, what is that smell? But what we've shown here is that there's no point in believing [cough] in anything you can't see for yourself."
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,spike,"W-Well t-then, s-see what's b-b-behind you, Twilight!"
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,I see it... But I don't believe it!
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,Is that a hydra!?
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,applejack,Who cares? Run!
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,Pinkie! Come on!
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,fluttershy,"Oh, I'm so sorry."
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,fluttershy,Ah!
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,Everypony up that hill!
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,spike,He-e-elp!
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"Coming, Spike! Hang on!"
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,I think we're gonna make it.
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,spike,But Pinkie's still shuddering!
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,"Oh, lookie there, it stopped. O-h-h-h, t-h-e-r-e i-t i-s a-g-a-i-n."
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"Ugh, he'll be up here in no time! Quick, one at a time, cross!"
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,spike,"Nyu-uh! Uh, do you know any spells for turning a hydra into a mouse?"
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,No.
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,spike,How about a squirrel?
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,No!
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,spike,How 'bout<U+0097>
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,No small rodents of any kind!
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,spike,That's too bad.
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,fluttershy,"A hop, skip, and a... jump!"
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,spike,Whoa-ho!
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,Whoa-oa-oa-oa-oa!
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,Oh... What would a brave pony like Rainbow Dash do? Chaaarge!
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,T-T-T-twilight!
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,T-T-T-twilight! You have to jump!
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,I'll never make it!
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,You'll be fine!
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,I will not!
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,It's your only ho-o-ope! You have to take a leap of faith!
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,Y-ugh! No! Oh no! Noooo! WA-A-A-AH! Ugh! Blegh!
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,"I knew you could do it, Twilight!"
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"I don't know how it happened; coincidence, dumb luck, or what, but you said there'd be a doozy here at Froggy Bottom Bogg, and I'd say we just had ourselves one heck of a doozy. I mean that hydra<U+0097>"
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,Pinkie?
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,That wasn't it.
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,Huh?
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,spike,What wasn't what?
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,applejack,"What are you talking about, Pink?"
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,The hydra wasn't the doozy.
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,"I'm still getting the shudders. Oo-o-oh, oo-o-oh. You see? There it is again. Whatever the doozy was at Froggy Bottom Bogg, my Pinkie Sense says it still hasn't happened."
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,Huh? But I<U+0097> WHAT?! The hydra wasn't the doozy?! How could it not be the doozy?! What could be doozier than that?!
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,"Dunno, but it just wasn't it."
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,Rrrgh... [flames and growls] Ooh... I give up...
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,spike,"Give what up, Twi?"
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"The fight. I can't fight it anymore. I don't understand how, why, or what, but Pinkie Sense somehow... makes sense. I don't see how it does, but it just does. Just because I don't understand doesn't mean it's not true."
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,Y-Y-Y-You m-m-mean you b-b-b-believe?
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"Eeyup, I guess I do."
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,"Oo-woo-oo-oo-oo, woo-oo-oo-oo-oh, woo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ooh. Ooh! [gasp] That was it. That's the doozy."
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,spike,Bbrrbbrrbbrr.
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,What? What is?
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,"You believing. I never expected that to happen. That was the doozy, oh and, oh what a doozy of a doozy it was! La-la-la-la-la..."
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"Oh, good, Spike, you're here. Take a letter."
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,spike,"With pleasure, Twilight."
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"Dear Princess Celestia, I'm happy to report that<U+0097> Spike, what have I been saying about focus?"
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"Spike: I know, but I... Well..."
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"What's wrong, Spike? Never thought you'd see me with an umbrella hat on?"
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,spike,"Not really, no."
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,Pinkie's tail's a-twitchin'. What else can I do?
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"I am happy to report that I now realize there are wonderful things in this world you just can't explain, but that doesn't necessarily make them any less true. It just means you have to choose to believe in them, and sometimes it takes a friend to show you the way."
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,Honk!
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,spike,Honk.
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"Always your faithful student, Twilight Sparkle."
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,There it goes again.
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,I wonder what's gonna drop outta the sky this time?
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,You never know.
Feeling Pinkie Keen,Dave Polsky,spike,Twitchy tail? Holy guacamole!
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,"Now, what have we learned?"
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,Loss of control.
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,Good.
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,Screaming and hollering.
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,"Yes, and most importantly?"
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,Passion!
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,"Right! So now that you know the elements of a good cheer, let's hear one."
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,[inhales] Yay.
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,... Ugh. You're gonna cheer for me like that? Louder.
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,Yay.
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,Louder!
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,Yay.
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,Louder!
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,[deep breath] [quietly] Yaaay.
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,Ugh...
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,Too loud?
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,Yay.
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,"[deep breath] And now, phase one of my routine."
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,Wooo.
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,Phase two.
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,Way to go.
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"[sigh] Last one. Thank you so much for helping me clean up all these books, guys. It was a crazy week of studying."
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,"Rainbow Dash, you rock! Woohoo. [gasp] Did my cheering do that?"
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,Hehe. Sorry about that ladies. That was a truly feeble performance.
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,"Actually, it wasn't all bad. I particularly liked it when you made the clouds spin."
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,"Ugh. I'm not talking about my performance, I'm talking about yours. That feeble cheering!"
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,What are you two arguing about?
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,Were we arguing? I'm sorry.
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,[grunt] I wish you guys could come to Cloudsdale to see me compete in the Best Young Flyer Competition.
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,What's that?
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,"It's where all the greatest Pegasus flyers get together and show off their different flying styles! Some are fast! [makes car sounds] And some are graceful. Whoa, whoa, whoa!"
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,applejack,Golly. I'd love to see you strut yer stuff in that competition.
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,"Yeah. I wish you guys could be there. Fluttershy's a great support, but her cheering isn't exactly inspirational."
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,"Ooh! I'd love to see you make a sonic rainboom! It's like, the most coolest thing ever! Even though I've never actually seen it, but I mean come on! It's a sonic rainboom! How not cool could it possibly not be?!"
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,What's a sonic rainboom?
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,You really need to get out more. The sonic rainboom is legendary! When a Pegasus like Rainbow Dash gets going sooo fast... Boom! A sonic boom and a rainbow can happen all at once!
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,applejack,And Rainbow Dash here's the only pony to ever pull it off!
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,It was a long time ago... I was just a filly.
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,"Yeah, but you're gonna do it again, right?"
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,Are... you kidding? I'm the greatest flyer to ever come out of Cloudsdale! I could do sonic rainbooms in my sleep.
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Wow. If you pull that off, you'll win the crown for sure!"
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,The grand prize is an entire day with the Wonderbolts. A whole day of flying with my lifelong heroes... It'll be a dream come true!
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,Yay.
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,"I'm gonna go rest up. Don't wanna over prepare myself, y'know. Hehe. You, on the other hand, better keep practicing. I need a cheering section to match my spectacular performance."
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,"She's practiced that move a hundred times, and she's never even come close to doing it. I don't know if I can cheer loud enough to help her."
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Well, guess we better get this cleaned up... again."
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,rarity,"Go on, go on."
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,Go on what?
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,rarity,Find a spell that will get us wingless ponies into Cloudsdale. Didn't you see how nervous she was?
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,applejack,Nervous? Have you spit yer bit or somethin'? She was tootin' her own horn louder than the brass section of a marching band!
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,rarity,"Oh, puh-lease. I have put on enough fashion shows to recognize stage fright when I see it. We've got to find a way to be there for her. Now go on!"
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,Owaa! Ugh. How am I supposed to find a flight spell in this mess?
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,A flight spell? One sec. Page twenty-seven.
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,applejack,How'd you do that?
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,It landed on my face when Rainbow Dash knocked me into the bookcase.
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Here it is! A spell that will allow Earth ponies to fly for three days. Ooh, it looks really difficult... I'm not sure I can do it."
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,rarity,You've got to try!
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,Okay... But who's gonna volunteer to be the test subject?
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,rarity,"I will! For Rainbow Dash, I will go first."
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,I think it worked!
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,"You've got to learn to be assertive, Fluttershy. Don't be afraid to speak up."
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,I didn't get kicked out.
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,"Now wait just a minute! Oh, I'm sorry. I'm trying to be more assertive. Anyhow... She is going to do a sonic rainboom!"
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,Then show up at the Cloudeseum and see for yourself! ...If you're free.
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,Did you see that? I was so assertive!
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,[sigh] Those guys are right. I'll never be able to do it.
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,"But, Rainbow Dash. Just because you've failed the sonic rainboom a hundred thousand times in practice doesn't mean you won't be able to do it in front of an entire stadium, full of impatient, super-critical sportsfan ponies."
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,Aaaaaah! What do I do?! Everypony's gonna see me fail! The Wonderbolts will never let a loser like me join. Princess Celestia will probably banish me to the Everfree Forest! My life is ruined!
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,Rare...
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,Rare?! The sonic rainboom is way more than rare!
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,Rarity?
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,Rarity! Are you... flying?!
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,rarity,I most certainly am! Aren't my wings smashing?! Twilight made them for me. I just adore them! Why so shocked? We couldn't leave our favorite flyer without a big cheering section!
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,"""We""? I... I can't believe it!"
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,It's incredible!
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,This is so cool! You guys made it!
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,Sure did!
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,Wait! How'd you do that? Only Pegasus ponies can walk on clouds.
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,"Haha. Pretty cool, huh?"
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"I found a spell that makes temporary wings, but it was too difficult to do more than once. So I found an easier spell that lets the rest of us walk on clouds."
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,applejack,And we came to cheer you to victory!
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,"To be honest, I was starting to get just the teeniest, tiniest bit nervous. But I feel a lot better now that you guys are here. Hey, we've got some time before the competition. Why don't Fluttershy and I show you around Cloudsdale?"
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,Here it is: the greatest city in the sky!
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,rarity,[in mirror] Oooh! Aaah!
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,Uhh... Some of the greatest Pegasi in history came from Cloudsdale!
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,rarity,"Oh, wait for me!"
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,rarity,"Why, thank you!"
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Be careful with those wings, Rarity. They're made from gossamer and morning dew, and they're incredibly delicate."
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,rarity,"Don't worry, Twilight. I'm sure they can't get worn out from too much attention."
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,applejack,"Since we're up here, I'd sure like to get a look at where the weather's made."
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,"Great idea! C'mon, girls. To the weather factory!"
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,"This is where they make the snowflakes. Each one is hoofmade. As you can see, it's a delicate operation."
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,rarity,"[gasp] Ooh, the snowflakes look even better from up here."
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,We better move on before Rarity ruins winter and causes a drought.
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,And here's where they make the rainbows!
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,[slurp] [pants] Spicyyyyyy!...
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,"Yeah, rainbows aren't really known for their flavor."
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,rarity,"Hmm... Yeah, I guess I could see that."
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,Rarity! What're you doing talking to these guys?
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,rarity,"Oh, they were just admiring my wings, Rainbow Dash."
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,Oohh...
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,"Uhh... C'mon, girls. Why don't we go see how clouds are made? Don't listen to them. You're gonna win that competition for sure!"
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,"Are you kidding? I can't do the sonic rainboom, and just look at these boring, plain old feathered wings. I'm doomed!"
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,rarity,"What, these old things? Go ahead, everypony. Photos are encouraged."
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Rarity, we're supposed to be helping Rainbow Dash relax, remember? Put your wings away and stop showing off!"
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,rarity,"Oh, pfft. How can you ask me to put away perfection?"
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,rarity,Waa-haa-haa!
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Rainbow Dash, are you okay? You don't look so good."
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,[panting] Of course! Why wouldn't I be okay? Everyone's so in love with Rarity's wings that they won't even notice when I totally blow it in the Best Young Flyer's Competition.
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,rarity,There really isn't anypony who uses their wings quite like me. Perhaps I should compete.
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,WHAT?!
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,What am I gonna DO?! I'll never win the competition now...
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,rarity,I'm going to be a while!
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,Eyah!
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,Umm...
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,She's talking to you!
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,rarity,"I'm number four, and I need just one more itsy-bitsy minute. Be a dear and have somepony go ahead of me, hmm?"
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,Uhh... What am I gonna do?
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,I loved number seven. Doing fifteen barrel rolls in a row can't be easy.
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,My favorite is number ten. She just looked like such a nice pony.
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,applejack,Hmm... Wonder how come we haven't seen Rainbow Dash or Rarity yet. The competition's almost over.
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,rarity,Rarity... is ready!
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,rarity,"Well, Rainbow Dash? Shall we?"
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,rarity,"Good luck, Rainbow Dash. Just do your best. I hope you don't mind, but I took the liberty of changing our music. That ""rock and roll"" doesn't really match my wings."
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,"[gulp] C'mon, Rainbow Dash. You can do this. Just remember the routine. Phase one."
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,Oof. Waaah!
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,Time for phase two.
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,Look! Phase two is working.
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,rarity,And now for my grand finale. I will fly right up to the sun and beam my beautiful wings over the whole city of Cloudsdale! [gasp and squeal] They'll be talking about it for years!
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,"Looks like this is my last chance to turn things around. Phase three. The sonic [gulp] rainboom. Wings, don't fail me now!"
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,rarity,"[panting] Look upon me, Equestria, for I... am... Rarity!"
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,Oh no! Her wings evaporated into thin air!
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,soarin,Aah!
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,spitfire,Uuh!
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,"Hold on, Rarity! I'm coming!"
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,"Oh, I can't look!"
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,A sonic rainboom! She did it! She did it! Wooo!
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,Whoa.
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,A sonic rainboom! Wooo! Yeah!
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,I did it. I did it!
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,rarity,"[sigh] You sure did. Oh thank you, Rainbow Dash. You saved my life!"
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,"Oh yeah. I did that too. Ha, best day ever!"
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,rarity,I want to apologize to all of you for getting so carried away with my... beautiful wings. I guess I just lost my head.
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,It's okay.
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,applejack,"Oh, don't worry about it, kiddo."
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,We still love you.
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,rarity,And I'm especially sorry that I was so thoughtless as to jump into the contest at the last minute after you had worked so hard to win it. Can you ever ever forgive me?
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,"Aw, it's okay. Everything turned out all right, right? I just wish I could have met the Wonderbolts when they were awake."
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,[gasp] Ohmygoshohmygoshohmygoshohmygoshohmygosh!
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,spitfire,"So you're the little pony who saved our lives. We really wanted to meet you, and say thanks."
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,Ohmygoshohmygoshohmygoshohmygoshohmygosh!
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,Princess.
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,princess celestia,"Hello, Twilight Sparkle, and hello to your friends too."
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,rarity,"Princess Celestia, I am sorry I ruined the competition. Rainbow Dash here really is the best flyer in Equestria."
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,princess celestia,"I know she is, my dear. That's why, for her incredible act of bravery and her spectacular sonic rainboom, I'm presenting the grand prize for Best Young Flyer to this year's winner, Miss Rainbow Dash!"
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,Ohmygosh ohmygosh ohmygosh ohmygosh ohmygosh ohmygosh ohmygosh ohmygosh ohmygosh ohmygosh ohmygosh!
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,princess celestia,"So Twilight Sparkle, did you learn anything about friendship from this experience?"
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"I did Princess, but I think Rarity learned even more than me."
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,rarity,"I certainly did. I learned how important it is to keep your hooves on the ground, and be there for your friends."
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,princess celestia,"Excellent. Well done, Rarity."
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,This really is the best day ever!
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,"Heh, thanks, guys."
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,"Aww, that's okay. Don't worry about it."
Sonic Rainboom,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,"Sorry, boys... But I've got plans!"
Stare Master,Chris Savino,rarity,"Where'd I put that? Ohh, I thought I already..."
Stare Master,Chris Savino,rarity,"Ohh, and I can't forget I've got to... oh, how am I ever gonna get this done?"
Stare Master,Chris Savino,sweetie belle,Are you sure I can't help? I could<U+0097>
Stare Master,Chris Savino,rarity,No!
Stare Master,Chris Savino,sweetie belle,Maybe just a<U+0097>
Stare Master,Chris Savino,rarity,No thanks!
Stare Master,Chris Savino,sweetie belle,How about<U+0097>
Stare Master,Chris Savino,rarity,Just stand over there.
Stare Master,Chris Savino,sweetie belle,But<U+0097>
Stare Master,Chris Savino,rarity,"Where you'll be out of the way. Ribbon, ribbon! Where's the ribbon?!"
Stare Master,Chris Savino,sweetie belle,I got it!
Stare Master,Chris Savino,sweetie belle,Whoa!
Stare Master,Chris Savino,rarity,Aah!
Stare Master,Chris Savino,sweetie belle,"Um, I-I'll just go and stand over there, where I'll be... out of the way."
Stare Master,Chris Savino,sweetie belle,Won't you at least let me help you clean up?
Stare Master,Chris Savino,rarity,No. You've helped me quite enough.
Stare Master,Chris Savino,sweetie belle,"I'm sorry, sis! I just thought that if I could help, I might find my special gift and finally earn my cutie mark."
Stare Master,Chris Savino,rarity,I understand. It's just that... I need this time to fill this order without any... complications.
Stare Master,Chris Savino,rarity,"Okay, all done. Now, back to work. I've lost a lot of time, and I cannot have any more interruptions."
Stare Master,Chris Savino,rarity,"Oh, what now?!"
Stare Master,Chris Savino,fluttershy,"Oh, sorry. I thought the ""open"" sign meant you were open, but I must have been mistaken."
Stare Master,Chris Savino,rarity,[gasps] Fluttershy! Forgive me! I was so wrapped up in my work that I forgot you were bringing Opalescence back from her grooming!
Stare Master,Chris Savino,fluttershy,"No worries, Rarity. I've left her there in the basket."
Stare Master,Chris Savino,rarity,"Oh, she looks great! I just don't understand how you're able to do it! I can't get near her without getting a swipe from her claws."
Stare Master,Chris Savino,rarity,Ahh! Did you use... the Stare on her?
Stare Master,Chris Savino,fluttershy,"Oh, no! I wouldn't! I couldn't! I-I don't really have any control over when that happens. I-It just happens. No, I'm just good with animals. It's my special gift, you know?"
Stare Master,Chris Savino,rarity,"Well, you should have a picture of Opal as a cutie mark instead of those butterflies."
Stare Master,Chris Savino,sweetie belle,"Ooh, ooh, oh, oh, oh, oh! Maybe I can be good with animals, too!"
Stare Master,Chris Savino,sweetie belle,Or not.
Stare Master,Chris Savino,rarity,"I'm sorry I can't invite you to stay and chat, Fluttershy. I've bitten off a bit more than I can chew with this order."
Stare Master,Chris Savino,sweetie belle,But you're not eating anything.
Stare Master,Chris Savino,rarity,"No, Sweetie, it's an expression. It means that I've taken on more work than I can handle. I've got twenty of these special robes to make tonight! They're due in Trottingham tomorrow morning."
Stare Master,Chris Savino,rarity,"See? I've lined them in a special gold silk. It took so long to make, but I think it adds just the right touch, don't you?"
Stare Master,Chris Savino,fluttershy,"These are lovely, but twenty by tonight? How will you get it all done?"
Stare Master,Chris Savino,rarity,"Well, I, uh..."
Stare Master,Chris Savino,sweetie belle,"Oh, oh, oh! Maybe I could... just... just stand over here and watch."
Stare Master,Chris Savino,rarity,I'll manage.
Stare Master,Chris Savino,fluttershy,"Well, maybe I should get out of your mane so you can work."
Stare Master,Chris Savino,rarity,"Hello, uh, girls..."
Stare Master,Chris Savino,sweetie belle,Scootaloo! Apple Bloom!
Stare Master,Chris Savino,scootaloo,You ready for tonight?
Stare Master,Chris Savino,sweetie belle,Yup! Cutie mark planning session is a go!
Stare Master,Chris Savino,apple bloom,Tonight is the night we each try to find our own special talent.
Stare Master,Chris Savino,scootaloo,Even if it takes us all night!
Stare Master,Chris Savino,apple bloom,I'm ready! You ready?
Stare Master,Chris Savino,scootaloo,Very ready!
Stare Master,Chris Savino,cutie mark crusaders,Cutie Mark Crusader sleepover at Rarity's! Yay!
Stare Master,Chris Savino,sweetie belle,And... look what I made us!
Stare Master,Chris Savino,fluttershy,What does that patch on your cape mean?
Stare Master,Chris Savino,cutie mark crusaders,The Cutie Mark Crusaders! Yay!
Stare Master,Chris Savino,scootaloo,"We're on a crusade, a mission!"
Stare Master,Chris Savino,apple bloom,To find our cutie marks!
Stare Master,Chris Savino,sweetie belle,"Yup. And look. I lined them with this special gold silk. It took sooo long to make, but I think it adds just the right touch, don't you?"
Stare Master,Chris Savino,rarity,"Sweetie Belle! What have you done? That was the last of the gold silk! Oh, now I'll have to make more! Oh, I hope I can make more. I'm gonna have to work all night! Which means... Sorry, girls, I'm afraid the Crusaders sleepover is cancelled."
Stare Master,Chris Savino,sweetie belle,What?!
Stare Master,Chris Savino,rarity,I just won't have any time to watch you if I want to get these robes delivered on time.
Stare Master,Chris Savino,sweetie belle,But<U+0097>
Stare Master,Chris Savino,rarity,"No buts this time. I'm sorry, Sweetie Belle. It's just the way it has to be."
Stare Master,Chris Savino,cutie mark crusaders,Awwww...
Stare Master,Chris Savino,fluttershy,"I, uh, I suppose I could take them for the night."
Stare Master,Chris Savino,rarity,I couldn't ask you to do that.
Stare Master,Chris Savino,fluttershy,"Oh, it's no problem at all."
Stare Master,Chris Savino,rarity,Have you met my sister and her friends? A problem is all it would be.
Stare Master,Chris Savino,fluttershy,Did I have a problem with Opal? You've seen how well I handle small creatures!
Stare Master,Chris Savino,rarity,I suppose that's true... and I do have a lot of work to do...
Stare Master,Chris Savino,fluttershy,"Come on, it'll be fun."
Stare Master,Chris Savino,rarity,"I assure you, they're quite a handful."
Stare Master,Chris Savino,fluttershy,These sweet little angels?
Stare Master,Chris Savino,rarity,Well... all right.
Stare Master,Chris Savino,cutie mark crusaders,Cutie Mark Crusader sleepover at Fluttershy's cottage! Yay!
Stare Master,Chris Savino,fluttershy,So cute. W-wait for me!
Stare Master,Chris Savino,rarity,Hmmm...
Stare Master,Chris Savino,fluttershy,"Oh, won't this be ever so fun? We can have a nice little tea party, and braid each others' tails, and sit quietly and color, and tell each other fairy tales, and<U+0097>"
Stare Master,Chris Savino,twilight sparkle,"Hello, Fluttershy."
Stare Master,Chris Savino,fluttershy,"Oh! Hello, Twilight. Where are you off to?"
Stare Master,Chris Savino,twilight sparkle,I'm heading to the Everfree Forest to Zecora's to get some of my favorite tea.
Stare Master,Chris Savino,fluttershy,"Th-The Everfree Forest? Ah, you'll be careful, won't you?"
Stare Master,Chris Savino,twilight sparkle,Of course! How about you? What are you doing with the girls?
Stare Master,Chris Savino,fluttershy,"Rarity has a big order to fill tonight, so I volunteered to take the girls over to my cottage for a sleepover."
Stare Master,Chris Savino,twilight sparkle,Wow. Sounds like everypony has their hooves full today. Taking care of those three fillies all by yourself? You sure you can handle it?
Stare Master,Chris Savino,fluttershy,What? These sweet little angels? They'll be no problem at all.
Stare Master,Chris Savino,sweetie belle,Wow! Look at this place! What's that? Are those chickens?
Stare Master,Chris Savino,fluttershy,"[to herself] No... problem at all. [normal] Okay, girls, uh, what should we do?"
Stare Master,Chris Savino,scootaloo,I'm gonna get my mark first!
Stare Master,Chris Savino,fluttershy,Girls?
Stare Master,Chris Savino,sweetie belle,Nuh-uh!
Stare Master,Chris Savino,fluttershy,Should we<U+0097>
Stare Master,Chris Savino,apple bloom,I am!
Stare Master,Chris Savino,fluttershy,"Girls, okay, now settle<U+0097>"
Stare Master,Chris Savino,scootaloo,I'm staying up all night!
Stare Master,Chris Savino,apple bloom,"Me, too!"
Stare Master,Chris Savino,sweetie belle,"Me, three!"
Stare Master,Chris Savino,fluttershy,"I-I know you're excited, but<U+0097> girls, oh, oh, careful with the<U+0097> oh, ah, girls<U+0097> [huffs] So! What do you wanna do? Play a game?"
Stare Master,Chris Savino,scootaloo,We are the Cutie Mark Crusaders!
Stare Master,Chris Savino,apple bloom,And we want to crusade for our cutie marks!
Stare Master,Chris Savino,sweetie belle,"And, and, and, we, um<U+0097> yeah! What they said!"
Stare Master,Chris Savino,fluttershy,"Mmm, I don't know... how about a nice quiet little tea party?"
Stare Master,Chris Savino,scootaloo,Or... we could go adventuring in the Everfree Forest!
Stare Master,Chris Savino,fluttershy,"Oh, no! The Everfree Forest is much too dangerous. It's filled with far too many strange creatures."
Stare Master,Chris Savino,sweetie belle,"But you could go with us and we could catch those creatures. We could be, umm... creature catchers!"
Stare Master,Chris Savino,cutie mark crusaders,Yay! Cutie Mark Crusader creature catchers!
Stare Master,Chris Savino,scootaloo,Arrrr! I am a dangerous creature from the Everfree Forest! Rrrarr!
Stare Master,Chris Savino,sweetie belle,"Halt, dangerous creature of the Everfree Forest. I am Sweetie Belle, the creature catcher, and I'm here to catch you!"
Stare Master,Chris Savino,scootaloo,You can never catch me! I am far too powerful and dangerous!
Stare Master,Chris Savino,sweetie belle,You cannot run from me!
Stare Master,Chris Savino,scootaloo,Raaaar!
Stare Master,Chris Savino,fluttershy,"Um, oh, maybe that's not such a<U+0097> now, girls, how about we do some nice coloring? Doh<U+0097>"
Stare Master,Chris Savino,sweetie belle,"Come back, dangerous creature, so I can catch you!"
Stare Master,Chris Savino,scootaloo,Never!
Stare Master,Chris Savino,fluttershy,Careful... you don't...
Stare Master,Chris Savino,fluttershy,...break anything.
Stare Master,Chris Savino,sweetie belle,"Sorry, Fluttershy."
Stare Master,Chris Savino,scootaloo,"Yeah, sorry."
Stare Master,Chris Savino,apple bloom,I guess we aren't creature catchers.
Stare Master,Chris Savino,fluttershy,"Oh, girls, it's okay. I<U+0097>"
Stare Master,Chris Savino,apple bloom,I know! We could be Cutie Mark Crusader carpenters!
Stare Master,Chris Savino,fluttershy,C-carpenters?
Stare Master,Chris Savino,apple bloom,Hammer!
Stare Master,Chris Savino,scootaloo,Hammer.
Stare Master,Chris Savino,sweetie belle,Hammer!
Stare Master,Chris Savino,scootaloo,Hammer. Hammer! ...Hammer.
Stare Master,Chris Savino,sweetie belle,Um ... that doesn't look like a table.
Stare Master,Chris Savino,scootaloo,We were making a table?
Stare Master,Chris Savino,apple bloom,Somepony needs to put this thing out of its misery.
Stare Master,Chris Savino,scootaloo,We are definitely not Cutie Mark Carpenters.
Stare Master,Chris Savino,sweetie belle,Who wants a picture of a hammer on their flank anyway?
Stare Master,Chris Savino,fluttershy,"Well, now that we've gotten that out of the way, how about a game?"
Stare Master,Chris Savino,apple bloom,A game?
Stare Master,Chris Savino,fluttershy,"It's called ""Shhh!"""
Stare Master,Chris Savino,scootaloo,What's that?
Stare Master,Chris Savino,scootaloo,I lose!
Stare Master,Chris Savino,sweetie belle,Me too!
Stare Master,Chris Savino,apple bloom,Me three!
Stare Master,Chris Savino,apple bloom,"Okay, now what can we do? Oooh! How about Cutie Mark Crusader coal miners?"
Stare Master,Chris Savino,cutie mark crusaders,Yeah!
Stare Master,Chris Savino,fluttershy,No!
Stare Master,Chris Savino,cutie mark crusaders,Awwww!
Stare Master,Chris Savino,fluttershy,"I mean, it's time for bed, don't you think? Aren't you excited to get all toasty and warm in your snuggly-wuggly widdle beds?"
Stare Master,Chris Savino,apple bloom,Snuggly-wuggly? But we have more crusadin' to do!
Stare Master,Chris Savino,scootaloo,We've got plans!
Stare Master,Chris Savino,sweetie belle,And capes!
Stare Master,Chris Savino,fluttershy,"Um, okay, um. Maybe the crusading can wait until morning? When it's light? And not so... dark?"
Stare Master,Chris Savino,apple bloom,How are we gonna find our special talent in our sleep?
Stare Master,Chris Savino,fluttershy,[blows out candle] Maybe you'll have a lovely little dream about your special talent.
Stare Master,Chris Savino,scootaloo,But we're not even tired!
Stare Master,Chris Savino,fluttershy,How about I sing you a lullaby?
Stare Master,Chris Savino,cutie mark crusaders,"Mm-hmm, yeah!"
Stare Master,Chris Savino,fluttershy,"Hush now, quiet now It's time to lay your sleepy head Hush now, quiet now It's time to go to bed"
Stare Master,Chris Savino,sweetie belle,I know this one!
Stare Master,Chris Savino,fluttershy,"Oh, how wonderful! Why don't you sing it with me?"
Stare Master,Chris Savino,sweetie belle,Hush now! Quiet now! It's time to lay your sleepy head! Said hush now! Quiet now! It's time to go to bed!
Stare Master,Chris Savino,fluttershy,"Okay Sweetie, that was..."
Stare Master,Chris Savino,sweetie belle,Driftin' (driftin') off to sleep! Exciting day behind you! Driftin' (driftin') off to sleep! Let the joy of dream land find you!
Stare Master,Chris Savino,fluttershy,"Thank you Sweetie, um..."
Stare Master,Chris Savino,sweetie belle,Hush now! Quiet now! Lay your sleepy head! Said hush now! Quiet now! It's time to go to bed!
Stare Master,Chris Savino,scootaloo,What is that?
Stare Master,Chris Savino,fluttershy,[gasp] Girls!
Stare Master,Chris Savino,apple bloom,"Fluttershy, your chickens are on the loose!"
Stare Master,Chris Savino,sweetie belle,I wonder what could have caused that...
Stare Master,Chris Savino,scootaloo,"Don't worry, Fluttershy, the Cutie Mark Crusaders will handle this!"
Stare Master,Chris Savino,sweetie belle,Cutie Mark Crusader chicken herders! Yay!
Stare Master,Chris Savino,fluttershy,"No, I don't think that's a<U+0097> ah, come back! Please!"
Stare Master,Chris Savino,fluttershy,"Come on, girls, the chickens are fine<U+0097> oh, girls, um... girls!"
Stare Master,Chris Savino,fluttershy,"Come on, in you go."
Stare Master,Chris Savino,fluttershy,"There's some good chickens. Okay, you three. Isn't it about time you got into bed?"
Stare Master,Chris Savino,cutie mark crusaders,But<U+0097>
Stare Master,Chris Savino,fluttershy,Please?
Stare Master,Chris Savino,fluttershy,"So, no more crusading for tonight, all right?"
Stare Master,Chris Savino,scootaloo,"Yes, Fluttershy!"
Stare Master,Chris Savino,sweetie belle,"We promise, Fluttershy!"
Stare Master,Chris Savino,apple bloom,"Good night, Fluttershy!"
Stare Master,Chris Savino,fluttershy,"Okay, good night."
Stare Master,Chris Savino,sweetie belle,"Okay, so what kind of crusading do we do next?"
Stare Master,Chris Savino,apple bloom,There's not much we can do from this room... unless we become Cutie Mark Crusader cottage cleaners.
Stare Master,Chris Savino,sweetie belle,"N-no, thanks."
Stare Master,Chris Savino,apple bloom,"Well, we have to think of somethin'. We can't just waste this opportunity to find out what our special talents are. Hey, girls! Look! Some of the chickens may have escaped!"
Stare Master,Chris Savino,sweetie belle,Into the forest!
Stare Master,Chris Savino,cutie mark crusaders,[whispering] Cutie Mark Crusaders chicken rescuers are go!
Stare Master,Chris Savino,fluttershy,"[sigh] It really wasn't that hard ... I mean, all I needed to do was just show them who's in charge. Nothing's gonna get past Fluttershy! Good with animals, good with kids."
Stare Master,Chris Savino,scootaloo,[whispering] Wait up!
Stare Master,Chris Savino,fluttershy,"Mmm, peace and quiet. [gasps] Too quiet. [gasps] Girls? Girls? Elizabeak! She's missing! Girls?! [gasps] Oh, no! They must have gone looking for my missing chicken! Which means... they must have gone into... [gasp] [gulp] The Everfree Forest!"
Stare Master,Chris Savino,apple bloom,"Here, chick-chick-chick-chick-chick! Brawck, bawk-bawk-bawk, brawck!"
Stare Master,Chris Savino,scootaloo,What are you doing?
Stare Master,Chris Savino,apple bloom,Callin' for the chicken!
Stare Master,Chris Savino,scootaloo,That is not how you call a chicken.
Stare Master,Chris Savino,apple bloom,"Oh, and you know how to call a chicken?"
Stare Master,Chris Savino,scootaloo,I know that's not the way.
Stare Master,Chris Savino,apple bloom,Then show me.
Stare Master,Chris Savino,scootaloo,I don't have to show you!
Stare Master,Chris Savino,apple bloom,You're just chicken!
Stare Master,Chris Savino,scootaloo,Am not!
Stare Master,Chris Savino,apple bloom,"Oh, wait, now I know how to call a chicken! Scootaloo! Scoot-scootalooooo!"
Stare Master,Chris Savino,scootaloo,That's so funny I forgot to laugh.
Stare Master,Chris Savino,apple bloom,You also forgot how to call a chicken!
Stare Master,Chris Savino,scootaloo,"Why, you..."
Stare Master,Chris Savino,sweetie belle,"Come on, guys, we're not gonna find the chicken or our cutie marks by arguing."
Stare Master,Chris Savino,apple bloom,Maybe that's our special talent. Arguin'!
Stare Master,Chris Savino,scootaloo,Is not!
Stare Master,Chris Savino,apple bloom,Is too!
Stare Master,Chris Savino,scootaloo,Is not!
Stare Master,Chris Savino,apple bloom,Is too! Anything yet?
Stare Master,Chris Savino,scootaloo,Nope.
Stare Master,Chris Savino,apple bloom,Darn.
Stare Master,Chris Savino,apple bloom,"Heeeere, chick-chick-chick-chick, baaawk, bawk-bawk-bawk-bawk-bawk-bawk-bawk, b-baaaaawk!"
Stare Master,Chris Savino,fluttershy,"[whispering] Girls? [gulp] Girls? [tiny terrified squeak] Oh! Get a hold of yourself, Fluttershy. Just put one hoof in front of the other."
Stare Master,Chris Savino,fluttershy,Ahh! What was that?
Stare Master,Chris Savino,fluttershy,"Oh, no! If you've been turned to stone, it must mean<U+0097> oh! Oh no, the girls! Don't move. I'll be back for you. Girls!"
Stare Master,Chris Savino,scootaloo,Is not!
Stare Master,Chris Savino,apple bloom,Is too!
Stare Master,Chris Savino,scootaloo,Is not!
Stare Master,Chris Savino,apple bloom,Is too!
Stare Master,Chris Savino,sweetie belle,"Girls! Our special talent is not arguing. Besides, what would the cutie mark of somepony whose talent is arguing even look like?"
Stare Master,Chris Savino,fluttershy,Girls? Girls?
Stare Master,Chris Savino,sweetie belle,Fluttershy?
Stare Master,Chris Savino,fluttershy,Girls! Thank goodness I found you!
Stare Master,Chris Savino,apple bloom,"Fluttershy, what<U+0097>"
Stare Master,Chris Savino,fluttershy,"Girls, we have to leave the forest at once!"
Stare Master,Chris Savino,sweetie belle,But... we haven't found the chicken yet!
Stare Master,Chris Savino,fluttershy,There's no time for that. There's a cockatrice on the loose!
Stare Master,Chris Savino,apple bloom,A cocka-what now?
Stare Master,Chris Savino,fluttershy,"A cockatrice! It's a frightening creature with the head of a chicken and the body of a snake. Now, come on!"
Stare Master,Chris Savino,scootaloo,"The head of a chicken and the body of a snake? That doesn't sound scary, that sounds silly!"
Stare Master,Chris Savino,apple bloom,"Why, if I ever saw one of them cockathingies face-to-face, I'd laugh at how silly it was."
Stare Master,Chris Savino,fluttershy,No! Never look one in the eye!
Stare Master,Chris Savino,fluttershy,If you look a cockatrice in the eye<U+0097>
Stare Master,Chris Savino,apple bloom,The chicken!
Stare Master,Chris Savino,fluttershy,Girls! Wait!
Stare Master,Chris Savino,cutie mark crusaders,"Here, chick-chick-chick-chick-chick!"
Stare Master,Chris Savino,sweetie belle,There he is!
Stare Master,Chris Savino,scootaloo,Two chickens?
Stare Master,Chris Savino,apple bloom,I thought only one escaped!
Stare Master,Chris Savino,sweetie belle,Grab them both!
Stare Master,Chris Savino,fluttershy,See? Now we have to<U+0097>
Stare Master,Chris Savino,fluttershy,"Girls, please. Girls<U+0097> now listen to me, girls, I<U+0097> please!"
Stare Master,Chris Savino,fluttershy,"Girls! Behind me, now!"
Stare Master,Chris Savino,fluttershy,"You! Just who do you think you are, going around turning others into stone?"
Stare Master,Chris Savino,fluttershy,"You should be ashamed of yourself. I have a mind to find your mother and tell her what you've been up to, young man. Now you go over there, and turn Elizabeak and my friend Twilight back to normal, and don't ever let me catch you doing this again. Do you understand me?"
Stare Master,Chris Savino,fluttershy,Are you girls all right? I was so worried!
Stare Master,Chris Savino,scootaloo,"Yeah, fine!"
Stare Master,Chris Savino,sweetie belle,Thanks to that stare of yours.
Stare Master,Chris Savino,scootaloo,You're like the queen of stares. You're the<U+0097>
Stare Master,Chris Savino,cutie mark crusaders,Stare Master!
Stare Master,Chris Savino,sweetie belle,We're sorry we snuck out of the house and into the forest.
Stare Master,Chris Savino,apple bloom,Yeah. We'll listen to you from now on.
Stare Master,Chris Savino,scootaloo,We promise.
Stare Master,Chris Savino,fluttershy,"Oh, you do, do you? Well, you better, or I'll give you... the Stare!"
Stare Master,Chris Savino,twilight sparkle,What... what happened?
Stare Master,Chris Savino,fluttershy,And that's when it brought you back from stone.
Stare Master,Chris Savino,twilight sparkle,This is gonna make quite a letter to the princess. I was wrong about you. You certainly do know how to handle those girls.
Stare Master,Chris Savino,fluttershy,"Oh, I wouldn't go that far."
Stare Master,Chris Savino,twilight sparkle,Hmm? How so?
Stare Master,Chris Savino,fluttershy,"I assumed that I'd be just as good with kids as I am with animals. Boy, was I wrong. I really learned the hard way not to bite off more than I could chew."
Stare Master,Chris Savino,twilight sparkle,"You and Rarity both. Good morning, Rarity."
Stare Master,Chris Savino,fluttershy,Did you finish all those capes?
Stare Master,Chris Savino,rarity,"[sigh] Just delivered them. I have to admit, if you hadn't come along, I might not have. Thanks again."
Stare Master,Chris Savino,fluttershy,Won't you stay for some tea?
Stare Master,Chris Savino,rarity,I really must get back to the shop and clean up. Girls! Get your things. Time to go. Girls!
Stare Master,Chris Savino,rarity,Girls! Time to<U+0097> Girls! Your things! Girls! It's time to<U+0097> Girls!
Stare Master,Chris Savino,fluttershy,Allow me. [clears throat] Girls?
Stare Master,Chris Savino,apple bloom,"Yes, Fluttershy."
Stare Master,Chris Savino,scootaloo,You called?
Stare Master,Chris Savino,fluttershy,Go and get your things. Rarity is here to see you home.
Stare Master,Chris Savino,sweetie belle,"Of course, Fluttershy, right away!"
Stare Master,Chris Savino,rarity,"Ah, huh, ah, how did you... how did you do that?"
Stare Master,Chris Savino,fluttershy,I guess I'm just as good with kids as I am with animals.
Stare Master,Chris Savino,cutie mark crusaders,"Thank you, Fluttershy! Bye! Thank you, Stare Master!"
Stare Master,Chris Savino,rarity,"Ah, uh, speaking of which, I could use your help with Opal."
Stare Master,Chris Savino,fluttershy,Of course. How about later today?
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,Where are you takin' us?
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,applejack,"We're almost there, young'uns."
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,I've never been here before.
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,scootaloo,Ouch!
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,Oh. Sorry.
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,scootaloo,Are we there yet?
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,There? Where? What? I don't even know what we're doing.
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,applejack,Here we are.
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,What are we lookin' at?
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,scootaloo,I have no idea.
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,What is that thing?
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,applejack,"Cutie Mark Crusaders, welcome to your new clubhouse. [silence] Well, don't thank me all at once. This was my clubhouse when I was your age. Sure it hasn't been used in a while, but it's empty and on a secluded, private part of the farm. And it's all yours. It just needs a little, uh... TLC."
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,scootaloo,TLC as in Tender Loving Care or Totally Lost Cause?
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,Applejack! We're supposed to turn this into our new clubhouse?
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,applejack,"Well, maybe y'all will get your cutie marks when you discover your talent for... Waaah! [crash] Uh... house cleanin'?"
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,granny smith,Soup's on!
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,"Whoa! Hi, Scootaloo! Back already? You're amazin' on that scooter."
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,scootaloo,"Thanks! Wow, Apple Bloom. You did all of this?"
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,"Yep! I've fixed the broken shutters, sanded off the splinters, rebuilt the roof, painted..."
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,scootaloo,That's so cool. What's Sweetie Belle up to?
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,"There you are, Sweetie Belle! See? I told you we could find her by following her totally awesome voice."
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,scootaloo,What's that sweet tune you're singing?
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,Oh. I was just working on our new Cutie Mark Crusaders theme song.
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,scootaloo,Teach us?
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,"Well, I've only come up with one part... but okay!"
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,They all say that you will get your mark When the time is really right
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,And you know just what you're supposed to do
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,scootaloo,[loud and off-key] And your talent comes to light!
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,applejack,"Well, uh... I'll be, Cutie Mark Crusaders. You've done one fine job with this place. So, what's next?"
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,"Well, now that we have a real life clubhouse..."
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,scootaloo,...and a map of Ponyville...
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,...and a Cutie Mark Crusaders theme song...
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,applejack,Theme song?
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,We're gonna go out in the world and discover our talents.
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,scootaloo,A new adventure!
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,And earn our cutie marks.
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,We'll leave no stone unturned!
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,scootaloo,No mountain unclimbed!
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,No meal uncooked!
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,No sock unworn!
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,applejack,"Well okay then! Sounds like you have a plan. I gotta, uh... Leave no apple unpicked! See y'all later!"
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,scootaloo,"Are we ready to get our cutie marks, ponies?"
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,cutie mark crusaders,Ready!
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,spike,I had nothing to do with this.
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,What is going on here?
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,"Hmm... Well, we sure aren't gettin' our cutie marks for bein' librarians."
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,spike,Huh. I should think not. What?
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,"Girls, I think you're going about this the wrong way. Instead of trying to do things in areas you're not familiar with, why not try doing things in areas that you already like?"
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,cheerilee,And I have the perfect place to start.
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,"""Showcase your talents..."""
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,scootaloo,"""...for all to see."""
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,"""Perform in the Ponyville school talent show!"""
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,cheerilee,"There'll be all sorts of awards. Best dramatic performance, best comedy act, best magic act... Surely you can find your talent."
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,This would be the perfect place to discover our talents. Jugglin'!
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,scootaloo,Acting!
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,Magic tricks!
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,Square dancin'!
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,scootaloo,Tightrope walking!
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,Tiger taming!
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,My little ponies! You're missing the point. Think about the things you already enjoy doing. Think about what you're already good at.
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,scootaloo,Sure! We can do that.
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,Yeah! Sure we can.
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,"Well, whatever we do, we'll do it as..."
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,cutie mark crusaders,...The Cutie Mark Crusaders!
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,rarity,Sweetie Belle! I told you not to touch my things. Come back with my supplies!
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,"We're just borrowing them for the talent show. Don't worry, sis. I promise we'll bring them back."
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,scootaloo,"Thanks, Mr. Breezy. We'll return the fan to you real soon."
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,What do we need this fan for?
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,Trust me on this one.
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,scootaloo,"Okay, so that's six wooden planks, four-by-eight plywood, a box of nails, four cans of paint, and four brushes. Anything else?"
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,"Yeah. Instructions on how to use six wooden planks, four-by-eight plywood, a box of nails, four cans of paint, and four brushes."
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,"""Ghosts, Goblins and Ghoulish Figures""? Good heavens, girls. What do you need a book like this for?"
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,scootaloo,"You'll see. Thanks, Twilight. We'll give it back as soon as we're done with it."
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,What do you think they're up to?
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,spike,I have no idea and I don't know if I should be excited or scared to find out.
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,I'm glad we're doin' this as a team.
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,Me too. Um... so what are we doing again?
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,scootaloo,"A super awesome dramatic song for the talent show, of course."
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,Right! With super-cool scenery. And amazing costumes!
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,And mind-blowin' dance moves.
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,scootaloo,This is gonna be soo amazing!
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,"Sweetie Belle, I think you should be a singer."
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,"What? No way I'm singing in front of a crowd. Twilight said to do something we like to do, and I'd like to be like my big sister, and she's a designer."
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,scootaloo,Fine then. You can do the costumes and the scenery.
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,"And Scootaloo, you're great in maneuvers on your scooter. So you should do the choreography. Y'know, all those dance moves."
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,scootaloo,"Nah. I'd rather sing a wicked rock ballad. Why don't you come up with the dance routine, Apple Bloom?"
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,Hm... I'm not much of a dancer... but I do like Kung-fu. That's kinda like dancin'. Hi-ya! Hah! Hah! Yah!
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,Then it's settled! Let's get started.
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,One... two... three... Oh! Oh!
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,scootaloo,"Ow, Apple Bloom! What are you doing?"
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,"Oh, I feel like I have four left feet. I can't even spin right."
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,scootaloo,"Don't be silly. You just gotta keep your head forward until the very last minute, like this. See? Easy-peasy. You just gotta practice a bunch, that's all."
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,Wow! That does look easy. Thanks. Okay. Let's try this again. Oh! Ouch! Ow. I'm okay!
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,scootaloo,Keep practicing!
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,Will do.
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,scootaloo,"We fight the fight, walk the walk. Talk the talk, eat the... uh... food like a celery stalk? Ugh! I'll never come up with anything! Never, never, never!"
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,"Come back! Come back! Uh. Dumb fabric. Hey, Scoot! How's the song going?"
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,scootaloo,Pbbbt.
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,Pbbbt? Oh my! Sounds serious.
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,scootaloo,"I'm just no good at lyrics. Coming up with words is, like... [pause] really hard."
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,"Oh, it can't be that bad. ""With our cutie marks we'll rock Equestria. We use our stomachs to... digestia""? Umm... Well... These are... um... good, but... How about after ""we fight the fight""... There is nothing that we fear We'll have to figure out what we'll do next 'Til our cutie marks are here"
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,scootaloo,Wow! That's so awesome! Did you just come up with that now?
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,Yeah... kind of.
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,scootaloo,"Thanks, I'm totally using that."
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,Oh no!
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,Ouch!
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,How's the spin coming along?
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,"I think I gotta just stick to punches and kicks. You know, ponies only have four legs."
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,[moan] I'll never be a designer like my sister Rarity.
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,"Hey, it's no big deal. Why don't you use the dress form? It'll help you with your patterns and help you put all the pieces in the right places."
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,"Oh, is that what that's for?"
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,Uh... maybe you should also clean your paintbrush between each color.
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,"Oh, I was wondering why all the colors looked like mud."
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,"You're not using power tools, are you?"
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,applejack,The talent show is just around the corner. I wonder how the fillies are doin'.
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,"Oh! Sorry, Scootaloo."
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,scootaloo,That's okay. Ugh!
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,"Oops! Sorry, Scootaloo. Ouch!"
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,scootaloo,"Oh, my bad, Sweetie Belle. Let's sing the chorus again!"
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,applejack,"Well, gosh. Sure wasn't expectin' that."
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,I think that sounded pretty good.
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,Me too. You think we're ready?
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,scootaloo,Ready as we'll ever be. Hey! Did you see us practicing?
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,applejack,Uh... Yeah.
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,Well? How'd we do? How'd we do?
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,applejack,Uh...
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,scootaloo,"Speechless! See, girls? I told you that's what we're gonna do. We're gonna leave them speechless."
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,cutie mark crusaders,Yay!
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,applejack,"""Speechless"" is right."
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,snips,"...And on the count of three, this rabbit will disappear, and something tasty will reappear in its place. A one, a two, and a three! Hey! Where are they? Snails, where are the... carrots. SNAILS!"
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,cheerilee,"Uh, how about a round of applause for the S&S magic act? Now for our next act, we have Sunny Daze and Peachy Pie reciting their favorite poem... on roller skates!"
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,Break a leg!
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,Sweetie Belle! What a thing to say!
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,"No, no, no. You see, in the theater it's considered bad luck to say ""good luck"". So you say ""break a leg"" instead."
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,My little ponies! How are you doing?
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,cutie mark crusaders,Nervous...
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,"Don't worry. You're gonna be amazing. Remember, just stick to what you know best. I can't wait to hear you sing, Sweetie Belle."
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,Why does everypony always think I'm gonna sing?
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,scootaloo,"Actually, Twilight Sparkle, I'm the main singer tonight."
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,Oh?
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,And I'm the main dancer. Hi-ya!
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,Oh?
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,And I'm in charge of...
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,Costumes?
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,And sets and props. How'd you know?
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,"Really, girls? Are you sure...?"
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,cheerilee,"Cutie Mark Crusaders, you're on next. Break a leg."
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,Break a le<U+0097>
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,Ugh!
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,Uh... good luck!
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,scootaloo,"Look, here, are three little ponies, Ready to sing for this crowd, Listen up, 'cause here's our story I'm gonna sing it"
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,cutie mark crusaders,Very loud!
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,scootaloo,When you're a younger pony And your flank is very bare Feels like the sun will never come When your cutie mark's not there
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,cutie mark crusaders,'Til our cutie marks are here!
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,scootaloo,They all say that you'll get your mark When the time is really right And you know just what you're supposed to do And your talent comes to light
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,cutie mark crusaders,Until our face is blue
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,scootaloo,Wow. That did not go as well as I expected.
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,I can't believe they're laughin' at us.
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,Was it that bad?
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,cheerilee,"Back on stage, girls. It's time for the awards."
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,Back on stage? No.
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,They'll just laugh some more.
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,scootaloo,"Yeah, what's the point?"
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,cheerilee,"Now girls, let's be good sports. You made a great effort. You should be proud. Now come on!"
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,cheerilee,Let's hear it for all our talented fillies and colts.
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,cheerilee,Our first award goes to... Snips and Snails for best magic act.
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,snips,Hey! Mine's at least shinier.
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,snails,"Well, mine's bigger."
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,snips,"Oh yeah, well... Well, mine is, um... heavier?"
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,cheerilee,The next award goes to... Sunny Daze and Peachy Pie for best dramatic performance.
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,cheerilee,"And finally, the last award of the night goes to... the Cutie Mark Crusaders!"
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,cutie mark crusaders,What?
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,cheerilee,For best comedy act.
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,Can you believe it? We won!
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,scootaloo,I knew our act was awesome.
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,You know what would be the best? If we won and we got our cutie marks.
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,"Congratulations, ponies! Job well done."
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,cutie mark crusaders,"[sadly] Thanks, Twilight."
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,"Hey, you don't sound too excited."
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,scootaloo,"[sigh] We worked really hard and won a prize, but we still don't have our cutie marks."
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,Which is the prize we really wanted.
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,"Oh, girls..."
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,But we think we know why.
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,Yes. We know why.
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,Oh? Tell me. I'd love to make a special report to the Princess.
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,"Well, maybe we were trying too hard."
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,Yes? And?
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,scootaloo,And instead of forcing ourselves to do something that's not meant for us...
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,Yes? Yes?
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,We each should be embracing our true talent!
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,And that is...?
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,cutie mark crusaders,Comedy!
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,applejack,Apple Bloom! You did it!
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,cutie mark crusaders,Did you see our award? Weren't we funny?
The Show Stoppers,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,One day... [giggle] One day...
A Dog and Pony Show,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,Perfect!
A Dog and Pony Show,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,"Coming! Welcome to Carousel Boutique, where every garment is chic, unique, and magnifique. [gasp] Sapphire Shores! The pony of pop!"
A Dog and Pony Show,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,You yah... Y-y-you know my name?

A Dog and Pony Show,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,"Spike, a lady is never jealous."
A Dog and Pony Show,Amy Keating Rogers,spike,"Eh, of course not. But were you totally flipping out or what?!"
A Dog and Pony Show,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,"Ladies do not ""flip out"", Spike. However, I was quite in awe. Oh, I need to find more jewels than ever before to decorate her costumes. Oh, aha!"
A Dog and Pony Show,Amy Keating Rogers,spike,Did you find some?
A Dog and Pony Show,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,"Yes, Spike! Right there!"
A Dog and Pony Show,Amy Keating Rogers,spike,Ooooo! You look so delicious...
A Dog and Pony Show,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,"Spike! I promised I'd give you gems to snack on, but we need to collect more first or I'll never be able to make these outfits for Sapphire."
A Dog and Pony Show,Amy Keating Rogers,spike,"Hm... I will miss you, my sweets."

A Dog and Pony Show,Amy Keating Rogers,spike,"At your service, milady."

A Dog and Pony Show,Amy Keating Rogers,rover,A Diamond Dog.
A Dog and Pony Show,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,"Oh really? Oh well, that explains your fine taste in jewelry. I mean I-I-I know that diamonds are a girl's best friend and now I know that they're a dog's best friend too, ha ha ha. So, um, [cough] you're out hunting for gems as well?"
A Dog and Pony Show,Amy Keating Rogers,rover,Yes. We hunt.

A Dog and Pony Show,Amy Keating Rogers,spike,Nooooooooooo!
A Dog and Pony Show,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"Spike, can you breathe now?"
A Dog and Pony Show,Amy Keating Rogers,spike,Yes... [pant] I think so.

A Dog and Pony Show,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,Yeah. 'Cause all you said earlier was...
A Dog and Pony Show,Amy Keating Rogers,spike,[pant] Aaaah! Rarity... woods... jewels... dogs... hole... taken... Save her!
A Dog and Pony Show,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"Not a whole lot to go on there, sport."
A Dog and Pony Show,Amy Keating Rogers,spike,Sorry. Rarity and I were in the woods looking for jewels when these creepy guys showed up.
A Dog and Pony Show,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,Creepy guys?
A Dog and Pony Show,Amy Keating Rogers,spike,They called themselves the Diamond Dogs. They grabbed Rarity and disappeared down a hole in the ground.
A Dog and Pony Show,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"Well, this sounds mighty easy. Just take us to that there hole and we'll save Rarity."
A Dog and Pony Show,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"Holy moly, that's a lotta holeys."
A Dog and Pony Show,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"Come on, girls! Let's get started."
A Dog and Pony Show,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,Hello?

A Dog and Pony Show,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,Quick! We gotta get down one before they're all filled up.
A Dog and Pony Show,Amy Keating Rogers,fluttershy,"Oh! Oh my. Oh, oh!"
A Dog and Pony Show,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,We can't muscle through it!
A Dog and Pony Show,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"Whew. Heavens to Betsy. Now I'm used to pickin' myself up and dustin' myself off, but Rarity won't even touch mud 'less it's imported."
A Dog and Pony Show,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"Oh, Rarity..."
A Dog and Pony Show,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,"Oh, woe is me! Whatever shall I do? Ah! Dirt, dirt! Get away, dirt! Oh! Make it stop, make it stop! Ah! Filthy, disgusting dirt. It stings, it burns. Help! Oh, somepony save me, save me!"
A Dog and Pony Show,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,We gotta save her.
A Dog and Pony Show,Amy Keating Rogers,fluttershy,But they blocked up all the holes.
A Dog and Pony Show,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,Don't mean we can't dig 'em out. Come on!
A Dog and Pony Show,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,Ow!
A Dog and Pony Show,Amy Keating Rogers,fluttershy,Oof!
A Dog and Pony Show,Amy Keating Rogers,spike,[panting] Whoa! Oof!
A Dog and Pony Show,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,Get 'em!
A Dog and Pony Show,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,Whoooaaa!
A Dog and Pony Show,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,Come on!
A Dog and Pony Show,Amy Keating Rogers,fluttershy,"All those scary monsters popping up everywhere. Oh, poor Rarity must be terrified."
A Dog and Pony Show,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,[worryingly] Ooh.
A Dog and Pony Show,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,Ah!
A Dog and Pony Show,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,Aah!
A Dog and Pony Show,Amy Keating Rogers,rover,Where are the trinkets?!
A Dog and Pony Show,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,Aaaah!
A Dog and Pony Show,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,Poor Rarity. What are we gonna do?
A Dog and Pony Show,Amy Keating Rogers,spike,"I got it! I'll save you, my sweet."
A Dog and Pony Show,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"Spike, it is very noble of you..."
A Dog and Pony Show,Amy Keating Rogers,spike,Shhh!
A Dog and Pony Show,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,[quieter] ...to sacrifice the gem Rarity gave you.
A Dog and Pony Show,Amy Keating Rogers,spike,"Oh, Lady Rarity. My damsel in distress."
A Dog and Pony Show,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"Hoho there, lover boy."
A Dog and Pony Show,Amy Keating Rogers,spike,Whoa! Whoa whoa whoawhoawhoa... I got a bite! I got a bite!
A Dog and Pony Show,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"Hold on there, little fella."
A Dog and Pony Show,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,Applejack!
A Dog and Pony Show,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,Twilight!
A Dog and Pony Show,Amy Keating Rogers,fluttershy,"Oh my goodness, oh my goodness..."
A Dog and Pony Show,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,Wait for me!
A Dog and Pony Show,Amy Keating Rogers,fluttershy,Oh!
A Dog and Pony Show,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,Whee!
A Dog and Pony Show,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"Whee! Ha, ha, ha!"
A Dog and Pony Show,Amy Keating Rogers,spike,"Oh, oh!"
A Dog and Pony Show,Amy Keating Rogers,spike,"Ha ha, it worked! We're in! Now we can finally save Rarity!"
A Dog and Pony Show,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,Um... Which way do we go?
A Dog and Pony Show,Amy Keating Rogers,spike,Nooooooooooo!
A Dog and Pony Show,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,All these tunnels... How are we ever gonna find Rarity?
A Dog and Pony Show,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,Guess we're just gonna have to start going down them one by one.
A Dog and Pony Show,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,That could take forever! There's gotta be way to narrow it down.
A Dog and Pony Show,Amy Keating Rogers,spike,I know! I bet they've taken Rarity down the tunnel with the most gems.
A Dog and Pony Show,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"But Spike, Rarity is the only one who knows how to find gems."
A Dog and Pony Show,Amy Keating Rogers,spike,"No, Twilight. You can! You can copy Rarity's gem-finding spell."
A Dog and Pony Show,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,Oh my gosh! You're right! Rarity showed me how she did it a while back. If I can just remember...
A Dog and Pony Show,Amy Keating Rogers,spike,"That's it. You did it, Twilight! Come on! We're coming, Rarity. We'll save you. Just hold on."
A Dog and Pony Show,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,"Oh please, Diamond Dogs. Please let me go."
A Dog and Pony Show,Amy Keating Rogers,rover,Forever! Muhahahaha!
A Dog and Pony Show,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,But whatever do you want from me?
A Dog and Pony Show,Amy Keating Rogers,rover,Gemsss!
A Dog and Pony Show,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,Oh! Is that all?
A Dog and Pony Show,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,"There. A lovely pocket of jewels are right there. Now, if you'd be so kind as to show me the exit?"
A Dog and Pony Show,Amy Keating Rogers,rover,"Good! [laugh] Now, dig them up, pony."
A Dog and Pony Show,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,What? But you said you wanted me to find the gems.
A Dog and Pony Show,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,Dig?
A Dog and Pony Show,Amy Keating Rogers,rover,"Oh, for goodness<U+0097> Fine! Just stop. Stop! Dig, dogs! Dig! And fast."
A Dog and Pony Show,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,"I beg your pardon, but what, pray tell, are you doing?"
A Dog and Pony Show,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,"Well, somebody certainly needs proper nail care. When was the last time you two had a manicure? You're scratching up my coat with those jagged things!"
A Dog and Pony Show,Amy Keating Rogers,rover,Please be quiet!
A Dog and Pony Show,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,"Good heavens, what is that smell?"
A Dog and Pony Show,Amy Keating Rogers,rover,Smeeeeeell?
A Dog and Pony Show,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,"Ah, mystery solved. It's your breath."
A Dog and Pony Show,Amy Keating Rogers,rover,"Enough! Search, pony!"
A Dog and Pony Show,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,"Well, since you insist... But I must say the working conditions in here are simply dreadful. Musty and damp, it's going to wreak havoc on my mane. And this air is stifling, suffocating. And when I try to take a deep breath, the stench of all you dogs makes me nauseated."
A Dog and Pony Show,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,"You look and smell like you haven't bathed in weeks. Have you never heard of soap? You could all do with a good round of soap and water. Oh water, oh water, I'm terribly thirsty. Could I please have some water?"
A Dog and Pony Show,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,"And that's another thing. I would appreciate if you stopped calling me ""pony"". I am a lady and I wish to be addressed as such. So you may call me ""Miss"" or ""Rarity"" or ""Miss Rarity""."
A Dog and Pony Show,Amy Keating Rogers,rover,Enough! Your whining! It-it-it hurts!
A Dog and Pony Show,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,"Whining? I am not whining. I am complaining. Do you want to hear whining? Thiiis iiis whiiining! Oooh, this harness is too tiiight! It's going to chafe. Can't you loosen it? Oooh, it hurts and it's sooo ruuusty! Why didn't you clean it first? It's gonna leave a staaain! And the wagon's getting heeeavy, why do I have to pull it?!"
A Dog and Pony Show,Amy Keating Rogers,rover,Stop whining!
A Dog and Pony Show,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,But I thought you wanted whiiining!
A Dog and Pony Show,Amy Keating Rogers,rover,"Geh! We'll do anything, pony!"
A Dog and Pony Show,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,[dreamily] Anything?
A Dog and Pony Show,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,[sigh] This water is hardly sparkling. But I suppose it will have to do.
A Dog and Pony Show,Amy Keating Rogers,rover,[panting] Wait! Why are we doing this?
A Dog and Pony Show,Amy Keating Rogers,rover,"Yes, yes, I know. This is ridiculous! Letting a pony order us around. What are we? Mice or dogs?"
A Dog and Pony Show,Amy Keating Rogers,rover,Dogs do not pull. Ponies pull. Let her make the awful noises.
A Dog and Pony Show,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,"What are you doing? Hey, you spilled my drink. Oh! [whining] Not sooo tiiight!"
A Dog and Pony Show,Amy Keating Rogers,rover,"Ha! Make the noises all you want. But move while you make them. Hyah, mule!"
A Dog and Pony Show,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,Did you just call me a... mule?
A Dog and Pony Show,Amy Keating Rogers,rover,Ehh...
A Dog and Pony Show,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,He called me ugly!
A Dog and Pony Show,Amy Keating Rogers,rover,No! Mule! I said mule!
A Dog and Pony Show,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,"An old ugly mule! And it's true! Just look at me. I used to be beautiful, but, but nooow..."
A Dog and Pony Show,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,You're just saying that!
A Dog and Pony Show,Amy Keating Rogers,rover,"Oh, uh, uh, nice. Yeah."
A Dog and Pony Show,Amy Keating Rogers,rover,"Oh, I've had just about enough of this!"
A Dog and Pony Show,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,We're getting close. I can feel it.
A Dog and Pony Show,Amy Keating Rogers,spike,It's coming from down here. Come on!
A Dog and Pony Show,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,She must be in there. Let's go!
A Dog and Pony Show,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"Hoh, doggies. If you can take this bull by the horns, you better be ready for a ride. Come on, ponies! Kick 'em up, kick 'em out. Buck 'em up, buck 'em down."
A Dog and Pony Show,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"Yeehaw! Get along, little doggies!"
A Dog and Pony Show,Amy Keating Rogers,spike,"I'm coming for you, milady. Hi-ho, Twilight! Away!"
A Dog and Pony Show,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,And just what do you think you're doing?
A Dog and Pony Show,Amy Keating Rogers,spike,"Please, Twilight. Just give me this."
A Dog and Pony Show,Amy Keating Rogers,spike,"Lady Rarity, I'm here to save you!"
A Dog and Pony Show,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,Excuse me?
A Dog and Pony Show,Amy Keating Rogers,rover,"We, uh, give her back. Yes."
A Dog and Pony Show,Amy Keating Rogers,spike,Rarity! You're safe!
A Dog and Pony Show,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,"Why, yes. Hello, girls. You arrived just in time to assist me."
A Dog and Pony Show,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,Assist you with what?
A Dog and Pony Show,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,With those.
A Dog and Pony Show,Amy Keating Rogers,spike,You're letting her leave with all these... jewels?
A Dog and Pony Show,Amy Keating Rogers,rover,Yes. Take them. And her with them.
A Dog and Pony Show,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,I can't believe you found all these gems!
A Dog and Pony Show,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,Heh. I can't believe you tricked all those dogs.
A Dog and Pony Show,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,Just because I'm a lady doesn't mean I cannot handle myself in a sticky situation. I had them wrapped around my hoof the entire time.
A Dog and Pony Show,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,I can't wait to write to Princess Celestia to tell her what you taught me today.
A Dog and Pony Show,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,Me? What did I teach you?
A Dog and Pony Show,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"Just because somepony is ladylike doesn't make her weak. In fact, by using her wits, a seemingly defenseless pony can be the one who outsmarts and outshines them all."
A Dog and Pony Show,Amy Keating Rogers,spike,"Hm... ""Outshines"" is right. Now you have enough gems to cover Sapphire Shores' costumes."
A Dog and Pony Show,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,"Not if you eat them all, Spike."
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"So sorry, Fluttershy. I hate being late for our weekly get-together. The usual!"
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,But you will not believe what happened to me.
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,Is everything all right?
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"Oh, it's much more than all right. I was on my way here, wearing my latest hat creation, when who should stop me on the street but Photo Finish!?"
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,Photo Finish?
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"She is the most famous fashion photographer in all of Equestria. Anywho, she saw my hat and said it was absolutely marvelous!"
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,What a lovely compliment.
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,She was so impressed that she wants to take some pictures of my shop featuring some of my clothes!
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,[squee] That's wonderful.
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,[vibrating] Do you know what this could mean for my fashion career?
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,"Oh, Rarity, I'm so happy for you."
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,But I'm going to need somepony fabulous to model for me. Somepony with beauty. Somepony with grace. Somepony... like you?
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,"Oh, goodness. I don't know."
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"Oh, this is such a huge opportunity. And it would mean so much to me."
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,"I'm flattered, really."
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,Nopony is going to have your elegance and poise.
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,But...
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,Nopony!
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,There has to be somepony more quali-
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,Please!
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,Somepony more into fashion.
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,Please!
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,Somepony more comfortable in the spotlight.
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"Please, please, pleeease!"
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,"Oh, if it's that important to you, of course I'll do it."
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"Oh, thankyouthankyouthankyouthankyou! You are the best friend a pony could ever have!"
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,[sigh] What a wonderful way to spend an afternoon.
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,Isn't it? Though I was so afraid you wouldn't agree to model for me that I felt completely frazzled. I think I feel a pimple coming on. Oh! Only one solution! The usual!
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,Hm... She's going to want to see attitude and pizzazz.
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,"A-a-attitude and, um... pizzazz."
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"More light! It has to catch the sequins just so or the whole outfit is just a disaster. Oh, and the headdress needs more feathers. Pinkie Pie! More feathers! And sequins! More sequins!"
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,And more ribbon! Oh no! Less ribbon. No! More ribbon.
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"Oh, this hem is completely off. Pincushion! Thank you all for helping me. I'm sorry to be so short with you, but I'm... I'm just so nervous."
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"Oh, doesn't that hurt?"
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,spike,"Thick scales. Can't feel a thing. And even if I could, there is no pain that would keep me from assisting the most beautiful creature in the world. I'm gonna tell you two a secret. But you have to promise not to tell anyone."
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,I promise.
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,"Cross my heart and hope to fly, stick a cupcake in my eye."
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,spike,I have a crush on Rarity!
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,[gasp] We won't say a word!
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Give me a break. Everypony already knows how you-
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,Twilight! You promised Spike you wouldn't say anything. He trusts you. And losing a friend's trust is the fastest way to lose a friend forever!
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,But-
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,Forever!
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,My lips are sealed. Though I'm pretty sure Rarity is gonna pick up on your feelings.
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,photo finish,"I, Photo Finish... have arrived."
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"Let me just say, what an honor!"
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,photo finish,We begin... now!
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,Attitude and pizzazz!
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,photo finish,Yes! Show Photo Finish something. No! Yeees. No! Yeees. No! Yeees. Enough!
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,She hardly took any pictures.
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,I'm so sorry. I tried my best.
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"Well, the headdress is too big for you and cape had too much sparkle. I can't believe I ever thought I could impress her."
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,photo finish,"It seems that I, Photo Finish, have found the next fashion star here in Ponyville."
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,Really?
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,photo finish,"Yes. Really. And I, Photo Finish, am going to help her to shine all over Eqvestria. Tomorrow, a photo shoot in ze park. [pause] I go!"
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"Did you hear that? I am going to ""shine all over Equestria""."
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,"Oh, Rarity. I was so worried I'd ruined everything."
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"No, no, no, yes! That is definitely the one. Photo Finish is going to love it. Everypony is going to love it!"
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,"Oh, I am so excited for you. Just don't forget us little ponies when you become the most famous designer in all of Equestria."
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,Never.
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,photo finish,"Put me down here. Oh, nonononononono. The model should be in something simple! Something inspired by... the nature!"
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"That's just what I was thinking. Um... give me a moment and I'll, uh, put a little something together."
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,photo finish,Yes... that will not be necessary.
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"But... but... how are you going to help me ""shine across Equestria"" if I don't design something new for these pictures?"
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,photo finish,I am not going to help you shine across Equestria. I am going to help her shine. She is my star. You! Go!
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,"I can't, Rarity."
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"Oh, but you must, Fluttershy. Photo Finish wants to make you a star. This is the opportunity of a lifetime. I know we were both hoping it would be my lifetime, but nonetheless you can't throw away this chance. You must do this for me. You must. You must! You must!"
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,photo finish,"Floottershy! It is time to make... the magics! Oh, wunderbar! You are like a delicate flower. So much more alluring without all those sparkles und feathers."
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,How'd it go? How'd it go?
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"It didn't. Photo Finish wanted to work with Fluttershy, not me."
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"Oh, Rarity. I'm so sorry. Is there anything we can do?"
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,I just vant to be alone right now.
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,spike,You heard her. She vants to be... alone. What? I didn't think she meant alone alone.
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,photo finish,Too much blush. Not enough. Too much. Not enough. Perfect.
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,photo finish,"Oh, yes! Even her schneezes are graceful. Now go! How do you feel? Excited? Overjoyed? Thrilled beyond your wildest dreams?"
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,N... nervous.
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,photo finish,Nervous? Dun be ridiculous. You're only facing a large crowd of ponies who will be watching your every move and silently judging you.
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,photo finish,Your cue! Now go!
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,You can't let Rarity down. You must do this. You must. You must. You must.
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,hoity toity,So perfect for my new advertisement.
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,Wow. Look how popular you are. I'm so excited for you. You must be having the best time ever.
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,"Oh, yes. Best time ever..."
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,photo finish,Floottershy! I have been looking for you everywhere. We have the thing at the place.
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,I'll see you at the spa? Our usual time?
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"Of course! I can't wait to hear all about the... ""thing at the place""."
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,I'm the one who should be mobbed by strangers wherever I go.
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,Welcome to Carousel Boutique!
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,sweetie drops,Is she still here? We heard Fluttershy was here.
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,Sorry. You just missed her. But you're still in luck. I'm having a huge sale on some of my best designs.
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,sweetie drops,And you are...?
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"Rarity, of course."
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,sweetie drops,Never heard of you.
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,photo finish,"Obviously I, Photo Finish, am thwilled to have found her."
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,Photo Finish?
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,photo finish,She's a natural in front of the camera.
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,Um... Photo Finish?
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,photo finish,"I only need to point and shoot, and I capture... the magics!"
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,"Photo Finish, I'm so sorry to interrupt. It's just that I'm running late."
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,photo finish,[gasp] How could I have forgotten?! Your appearance at the ballet opening! Everypony who is anypony will be there.
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,"Oh, actually I'm supposed to be meeting my friend..."
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,photo finish,We go!
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"My hooves are getting positively pruney, I've been waiting here so long. Obviously Fluttershy's just too busy with her new career to spend time with her best friend."
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,I'm sure she just got tied up.
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,Of course she did. She's a big bright shining star! I wish that star would burn out.
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Rarity! Fluttershy is your friend.
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"I know, I know. And I should be happy for her, but instead I'm just... jealous! Oh, please promise you won't tell her I feel this way. Please, please, pleasepleaseplease!"
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,You have my word. Losing a friend's trust is the fastest way to lose a friend.
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,Forever!
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Wow! You look great!
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"Fluttershy may be the one who's famous, but that doesn't mean I have to stop looking fabulous."
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,"Rarity! I'm so sorry I'm... Oh no. She's already gone, isn't she?"
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Sorry.
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Feel better?
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,[sighs] No. Can I tell you something?
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Of course.
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,You promise not to tell Rarity?
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,I swear.
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,Pinkie Pie Swear?
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"Cross my heart and hope to fly, stick a cupcake in my [poke] Ooowwwww!"
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,"I don't like being a model. No, I hate being a model. All this attention is awful, just awful. And I'm only doing it because Rarity told me I must. I must! I must! [sigh] I must..."
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"Oh, really? Well... If you wanna know the truth, Rarity..."
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,"Oh, what were you about to say?"
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,[quietly] Forever!
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Nothing!
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"I was just thinking. If you really don't like being a model, you could always quit."
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,"Oh, no. I could never do such a thing. Rarity would be devastated."
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,[chomp] Mmm... Juicy!
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Uhhhhhh!
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,"Oh, if only all these ponies didn't like me so much. Photo Finish wouldn't want me to model anymore. She'd find somepony else with... the magic!"
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"I guess you're right. [pause] You're right. You're right, you're right, you're right!"
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"Don't you see? On her own, Fluttershy could never do something unattractive. But if I used my magic to help her do something unattractive at her next fashion show, no one will ever want her to model again. And if Fluttershy no longer has to be a model, Rarity will no longer have to be jealous of her. And I'll no longer have to keep their secrets! It's the perfect plan! You can't tell anyone about it. Promise me you won't tell anyone?"
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,So you do promise or you don't?
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Obviously.
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,You really think it'll work?
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,They love you for being you. So all I have to do is make you not be you. Just leave it to me.
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,Guess it's time to see what all the fuss is about.
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,Oof!
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,[gasp] Ooh... Aah!
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,Oh no.
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,photo finish,"I, Photo Finish, have made a terrible mistake!"
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,Bravo! I say bravo!
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,Such attitude! Such pizzazz! She's invented an entirely new kind of modeling! Bravo!
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,"This is awful. Just awful! Somehow I've become more popular than ever. Oh, I'm so frustrated I could just kick something!"
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,If only Rarity didn't want me to be a model so badly.
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Ugh! But Rarity...!
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,Fluttershy! Are you all right?
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,I'm great! I'm a super famous fashion model. Why wouldn't I be great?
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Because you ha...!
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"Out there on the runway, everyone was turning on you and... Oh... Oh, Fluttershy. It's so awful. I wanted them to."
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,You did?!
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Of course she did! Because...!
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"I'm jealous! I wanted all the attention. And instead it was going to you. I even started hoping that you would do something silly so your modeling career would be over. But then, when it started happening, all I could think was how could I want you to fail at something you love so much?"
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,But... Fluttershy doesn't... Ugh!
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,"Love? Oh, Rarity. I hate being a model."
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,You do?
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,More than anything.
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,Then why did you keep doing it?
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,"I was afraid if I quit, you'd be mad at me for not wanting to... ""shine all over Equestria""."
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"And I thought if I told you how jealous I was of your success, you'd think I was a terrible friend."
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,Never!
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,All this time!
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,If we'd just told each other the truth.
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,I promise never to keep my feelings in secret again.
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,Me too.
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,photo finish,You were brilliant. Brilliant! I've already got six photo shoots lined up for tomorrow alone.
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,"I'm sorry, Photo Finish, but I don't think I'll be able to make any of them."
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,photo finish,Whaaat?
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,photo finish,Vat has just happened?
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Spike has a crush on Rarity!
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,[sigh] And you were doing so well.
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,Now this is a wonderful way to spend an afternoon.
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"Isn't it, though?"
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"Dear Princess Celestia,"
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"Being a good friend means being able to keep a secret. But you should never be afraid to share your true feelings with a good friend. Did you get all that, Spike?"
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,spike,No. I did not. I still can't believe you told someone about my secret feelings for Rarity.
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"You're right. That was wrong of me, and I'm very sorry."
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,spike,Apology accepted.
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Now will you take down my letter to Princess Celestia?
Green Isn't Your Color,Meghan McCarthy,spike,I would love to. But... I'm a little busy at the moment.
Over a Barrel,Dave Polsky,applejack,"And that's when the yellow birdie thought to himself, ""Hmm. My favorite little tree isn't such a little tree anymore."" So she sang her song, big and strong, and they all lived in that great, big tree happily ever after. The... end."
Over a Barrel,Dave Polsky,rarity,Applejack! Were you reading a bedtime story to... an apple tree?
Over a Barrel,Dave Polsky,applejack,"Heh... uh... Well, ya know, bein' replanted in a whole new place is very upsettin' for a tree... and Bloomberg here is one of my favorites."
Over a Barrel,Dave Polsky,rarity,"No fair, Applejack! You've got a luxurious, private sleeper car for a tree, while I am crowded and cramped in the same car with all the other ponies. How am I supposed to get my beauty sleep?!"
Over a Barrel,Dave Polsky,applejack,But Bloomberg's the whole reason we're makin' this trip. He needs his rest so we can give him as a gift to my relatives in Appleloosa.
Over a Barrel,Dave Polsky,rarity,Hmph! You talk about it as if it's your baby or something.
Over a Barrel,Dave Polsky,applejack,"Who you callin' a baby?! Bloomberg's no baby! Don't wet widdle Rarity make you all saddy-waddy. Bloomberg's a big and strong apple tree. Yes, he is. A-coochie-coochie-coo-coo-coo!"
Over a Barrel,Dave Polsky,rarity,"It's widdle Rarity who's all ""saddy-waddy""! Urgh!"
Over a Barrel,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,"Oh man, we're going fast! This is so exciting, I can't even wait!"
Over a Barrel,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,Oh my goodness...
Over a Barrel,Dave Polsky,rarity,[sigh] For crying out loud in the morning!
Over a Barrel,Dave Polsky,spike,"[groan] Do you guys mind? I was up early fire-roasting those snacks you're all eating, and I'm pooped!"
Over a Barrel,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,"Uh, speaking of, some of these popcorn kernels didn't get popped."
Over a Barrel,Dave Polsky,spike,"Okay, fine..."
Over a Barrel,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,Ghk...
Over a Barrel,Dave Polsky,spike,Good night!
Over a Barrel,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,Uhh... maybe it's time we all got a little shut-eye. We've got a big day ahead of us tomorrow.
Over a Barrel,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,"[whispering] Psst! Pinkie Pie, you asleep yet?"
Over a Barrel,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,"[whispering] No, are you asleep yet?"
Over a Barrel,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,"[whispering] If I was sleeping, how could I have asked you if you were asleep?"
Over a Barrel,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,"[whispering] When we get to Appleloosa, you think we'll have to carry that heavy tree all the way from the train to the orchard?"
Over a Barrel,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,[whispering] What tree? You mean Bloomberg?
Over a Barrel,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,"[whispering and sarcastically] ...No, Fluttershy."
Over a Barrel,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,"[whispering] Fluttershy's not a tree, silly!"
Over a Barrel,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,What's going on?
Over a Barrel,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,Rainbow Dash thinks Fluttershy's a tree!
Over a Barrel,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,[whispering] I do not think she's a tree! I was just<U+0096>
Over a Barrel,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,Did you say she was a tree?
Over a Barrel,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,[whispering] No. Well.. Yes. But not exactly<U+0096>
Over a Barrel,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"Ya know she's not a tree, right?"
Over a Barrel,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,"She's not a tree, Dashie!"
Over a Barrel,Dave Polsky,fluttershy,I'd like to be a tree...
Over a Barrel,Dave Polsky,spike,"Oh, for Pete's sake!"
Over a Barrel,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,Well that was kind of huffy.
Over a Barrel,Dave Polsky,fluttershy,Huffy the magic dragon!
Over a Barrel,Dave Polsky,rarity,Would you all be quiet... now?!
Over a Barrel,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,A buffalo stampede!
Over a Barrel,Dave Polsky,rarity,I just love their accessories!
Over a Barrel,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,They're getting awfully close to the train.
Over a Barrel,Dave Polsky,rarity,I want to speak to the manager!
Over a Barrel,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,"Oooh, looky! Now they're doing tricks! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Now do a backflip!... Or... Just jump?"
Over a Barrel,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,Hmm.. Something tells me this isn't a circus act. Hey there!
Over a Barrel,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,"Where ya headed in such a hurry? Wow, you're pretty quick for someone so... bulky. No offense."
Over a Barrel,Dave Polsky,applejack,[gasp] They've got Bloomberg!
Over a Barrel,Dave Polsky,spike,Heeeelp!
Over a Barrel,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,And Spike!
Over a Barrel,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,Ugggh..
Over a Barrel,Dave Polsky,spike,[distant] Heeeelp!
Over a Barrel,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,Dragon-napping Spike. I'll show her! Ow...
Over a Barrel,Dave Polsky,braeburn,Hey there! Welcome ta A-A-ppleloosa!
Over a Barrel,Dave Polsky,applejack,"Braeburn, listen<U+0096>"
Over a Barrel,Dave Polsky,braeburn,"Cousin Applejack, mind yer manners, you have yet ta introduce me to your compadres! Shame on you!"
Over a Barrel,Dave Polsky,applejack,"Braeburn, listen, somethin' terrible's happened<U+0096>"
Over a Barrel,Dave Polsky,braeburn,"Terrible is right, your train is a full seven minutes late! That's seven minutes less for you to delight in the pleasures and wonders of... A-A-A-ppleloosa! Boggles the mind, we settler ponies built all this in just the past year, don't it?! And as you can see, we have all of the finest comforts. Like horse-drawn carriages!"
Over a Barrel,Dave Polsky,braeburn,And those there are horse-drawn horse-drawn carriages.
Over a Barrel,Dave Polsky,applejack,"...Listen, Braeburn, I<U+0096> Oof!"
Over a Barrel,Dave Polsky,braeburn,"And here's our local waterin' hole, the Salt Block."
Over a Barrel,Dave Polsky,braeburn,Over there's the office of Sheriff Silverstar. And here's where we have our wild west dances! And here's where we have our mild west dances!
Over a Barrel,Dave Polsky,applejack,"But, Braeburn, we<U+0096>"
Over a Barrel,Dave Polsky,braeburn,And here's the most wonderful sight in all of... A-A-A-ppleloosa! Our apple orchard.
Over a Barrel,Dave Polsky,applejack,Braeburn!
Over a Barrel,Dave Polsky,braeburn,First harvest should be any day now.
Over a Barrel,Dave Polsky,applejack,Braebu<U+0096>
Over a Barrel,Dave Polsky,braeburn,Good thing too!
Over a Barrel,Dave Polsky,applejack,Brae<U+0096>
Over a Barrel,Dave Polsky,braeburn,'Cause we need that grub to live on.
Over a Barrel,Dave Polsky,applejack,Braeburn!
Over a Barrel,Dave Polsky,braeburn,"Uh, yes, cuz?"
Over a Barrel,Dave Polsky,applejack,"You have a very nice town an' all, but we have a hu-uge problem! Some of our friends are missin'!"
Over a Barrel,Dave Polsky,fluttershy,A stampede of buffalo.
Over a Barrel,Dave Polsky,rarity,They took Spike!
Over a Barrel,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,Rainbow Dash went after them!
Over a Barrel,Dave Polsky,fluttershy,And we can't find Pinkie Pie.
Over a Barrel,Dave Polsky,applejack,"And we had an apple tree with us for your orchard, but they took that too!"
Over a Barrel,Dave Polsky,braeburn,"Did you say... buffalo? [sigh] Them buffalo, they want us settler ponies to take every single tree you see here off this land. They sure as hay don't want any new ones added in."
Over a Barrel,Dave Polsky,fluttershy,But why?
Over a Barrel,Dave Polsky,braeburn,"Beats me. We put a lot of hard work into this land, so we can feed our town, our families, our foals! And now they're sayin' all these trees have to go? T'ain't fair..."
Over a Barrel,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,"Ooh, I can't wait to get my hooves on that little buffalo... Hnnh... Ow! Nobody tricks Rainbow Dash and gets away with it."
Over a Barrel,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,Boo!
Over a Barrel,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,Yah! ...Pinkie Pie!
Over a Barrel,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,"Ah, ya caught me! Looks like I tricked you and didn't get away with it either! You're good."
Over a Barrel,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,Shhshh! What do you think you're doing?! You gotta get out of here!
Over a Barrel,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,I do?
Over a Barrel,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,You're gonna blow my cover.
Over a Barrel,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,I am?
Over a Barrel,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,I'm trying to save Spike!
Over a Barrel,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,Oh my gosh! So am I!
Over a Barrel,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,"And the more of us there are out here, the more chances of us getting... caught. Run, Pinkie, I'll hold 'em off. Save yourself!"
Over a Barrel,Dave Polsky,spike,"Stop! Dash, Pinkie, 'sup? Hey, no worries, I know those guys. They're cool."
Over a Barrel,Dave Polsky,spike,"Seems they took me by mistake. And they feel awful about it too, poor guys. Fortunately, they totally respect dragons, so they treat me like an honored guest."
Over a Barrel,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,[sniff] Ugh...
Over a Barrel,Dave Polsky,spike,"Still don't like ponies much, though... But you're with me, so it's cool."
Over a Barrel,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,"Huh. Well, I still don't trust them. I say we turn tail and bail while we still<U+0096>"
Over a Barrel,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,"Mmm! [munching] Before we finish eating? Are you loco in the coco?! Can I please have more of that mushy stuff, whatever it was?"
Over a Barrel,Dave Polsky,spike,"Turquoise. Mmm! [munching] Heh hah! This here is Little Strongheart, and these are my friends Pinkie Pie and Rainbow Dash."
Over a Barrel,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,You!
Over a Barrel,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,That's it! We are outta here!
Over a Barrel,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,"Yeah, right."
Over a Barrel,Dave Polsky,spike,I think it's time they met Chief Thunderhooves.
Over a Barrel,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,"Well that's not very nice. Right, Rainbow Dash?"
Over a Barrel,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,Hmph...
Over a Barrel,Dave Polsky,spike,"See, Rainbow Dash? They had a good reason to<U+0096>"
Over a Barrel,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,Huh... Ah!
Over a Barrel,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,I'll say they had a good reason! C'mon. We have some apple-pickin' Appleloosans to talk to!
Over a Barrel,Dave Polsky,rarity,"Ow! [groaning] Gently, please!"
Over a Barrel,Dave Polsky,applejack,"Sorry, Rarity, but our friends are out there and we have ta' be ready for a long hike into buffalo territory if we're gonna save 'em! Let's go!"
Over a Barrel,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,"Hi, guys!"
Over a Barrel,Dave Polsky,fluttershy,Pinkie! We're so glad you're safe.
Over a Barrel,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,How did you escape from the buffalo?
Over a Barrel,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,We didn't!
Over a Barrel,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,We promised the buffalo a chance to talk.
Over a Barrel,Dave Polsky,applejack,"Oh, yeah? 'Bout what?"
Over a Barrel,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,We brought our new pal Little Strongheart here to explain to the Appleloosans why they should move the apple trees off buffalo land.
Over a Barrel,Dave Polsky,braeburn,That information would be quite help<U+0096>
Over a Barrel,Dave Polsky,applejack,That's weird. 'Cause my cousin Braeburn here wants to explain to the buffalo why they should let the apple trees stay.
Over a Barrel,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,"The land is theirs! You planted the trees not knowing that. Honest mistake. Now, you just gotta move 'em, that's all."
Over a Barrel,Dave Polsky,braeburn,Well... heh...
Over a Barrel,Dave Polsky,applejack,"They busted their rumps here! An' now they're supposed ta bust their rumps again, just 'cause some buffalo won't stampede someplace else?"
Over a Barrel,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,Plant the trees somewhere else!
Over a Barrel,Dave Polsky,applejack,Where?! It's the only flatland around these parts!
Over a Barrel,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,The buffalo had it first!
Over a Barrel,Dave Polsky,applejack,The settler ponies need it to live!
Over a Barrel,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,"Come on, Applejack!"
Over a Barrel,Dave Polsky,applejack,[over Rainbow Dash] You're bein' unreasonable!
Over a Barrel,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,[over Applejack] I put my hoof down!
Over a Barrel,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,Look! Both the settlers and the buffalo have good reasons to use this land. There must be something we can do.
Over a Barrel,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,Hey! I've got an idea!
Over a Barrel,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,"We may be divided But of you all, I beg To remember we're all hoofed At the end of each leg"
Over a Barrel,Dave Polsky,spike,"[applauds] All right, Pinkie Pie! That was fantastic! What a great song! Yeah, right on!"
Over a Barrel,Dave Polsky,braeburn,"But, Sheriff..."
Over a Barrel,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,Oh... That wasn't the message of my song at all...
Over a Barrel,Dave Polsky,applejack,I want my kin ta' have what they need to live... but a storm's a-brewin' here. And I don't like the look of it.
Over a Barrel,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"We've just got to talk some sense into them before somepony gets hurt. Listen, maybe if you would just reconsider, we<U+0096>"
Over a Barrel,Dave Polsky,rarity,About the trees. Now if you could<U+0096>
Over a Barrel,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,If we could just sit down and talk we could<U+0096>
Over a Barrel,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,[gasp] Why won't anybody be rational and reasonable?!
Over a Barrel,Dave Polsky,applejack,"Sheriff, if we could only<U+0096>"
Over a Barrel,Dave Polsky,spike,Isn't there someway to stop this?
Over a Barrel,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,I know you don't want to do this.
Over a Barrel,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,I don't know... but it's never too late to think of something.
Over a Barrel,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,"Come on, think! Think, think, think, think, think, think, think!"
Over a Barrel,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,[gasp] He's not gonna do it!
Over a Barrel,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,<U+0096>what do you say? You gotta share You gotta care It's the right thing to do
Over a Barrel,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,Wah-ahh! Whoa-oo-oo-oo-ooa!
Over a Barrel,Dave Polsky,spike,I'd rather eat turquoise any day of the week. [chomp] Auhh...!
Over a Barrel,Dave Polsky,applejack,"Bloomberg, this is yer special day. Mama's so proud of you!"
Over a Barrel,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"Dear Princess Celestia,"
Over a Barrel,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,Friendship is a wondrous and powerful thing. Even the worst of enemies can become friends. You need understanding and compromise. You've got to share. You've got to care.
Over a Barrel,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,Hey! That's what I said!
A Bird in the Hoof,Charlotte Fullerton,fluttershy,"There you go, Mr. Mousey. Now you stay off that leg and do everything I told you. And it will be just like new in no time at all."
A Bird in the Hoof,Charlotte Fullerton,fluttershy,"Oh, you're welcome. Happy to be able to help."
A Bird in the Hoof,Charlotte Fullerton,fluttershy,You... found a watch? You... wanna be a watch? You're running! Running out of time? No. You're... late?
A Bird in the Hoof,Charlotte Fullerton,fluttershy,"[gasp] I'm late for a very important date! The big brunch for Princess Celestia at Sugarcube Corner. Oh, the princess is here in Ponyville for a party, and we all promised we'd be there. But I'm not there! Oh, do I look all right? Do I need to bring anything? Maybe I shouldn't go."
A Bird in the Hoof,Charlotte Fullerton,fluttershy,Aah! It's starting! I'm missing it!
A Bird in the Hoof,Charlotte Fullerton,fluttershy,"Oh, thanks, Angel. I mean, if you hadn't reminded me, I might have not remembered, and then I wouldn't be there, and everypony would be wondering where I was and... Oh, right. I'm late."
A Bird in the Hoof,Charlotte Fullerton,fluttershy,"Oh, okay then. See you later."
A Bird in the Hoof,Charlotte Fullerton,rainbow dash,"So... what do I have to do to get to be one of the Princess's royal guards, anyway? Is the pay good? Hellooo? Anybody home? [babbles] Wah-wah! [babbles] Ooh, you're good. [pause] Too good. I'm bored."
A Bird in the Hoof,Charlotte Fullerton,fluttershy,[gulp] No one. Never mind. I'll go home.
A Bird in the Hoof,Charlotte Fullerton,twilight sparkle,"It's all right, sirs. She's on the list."
A Bird in the Hoof,Charlotte Fullerton,fluttershy,"Thanks, Twilight."
A Bird in the Hoof,Charlotte Fullerton,twilight sparkle,"I'm so glad you could make it, Fluttershy. It wouldn't be the same without you."
A Bird in the Hoof,Charlotte Fullerton,mr. cake,Mr. How's everypony doing? Good? Good.
A Bird in the Hoof,Charlotte Fullerton,mrs. cake,"Mrs. Anything else we can get for you, dearies...? Ooh, I-I mean, esteemed guests."
A Bird in the Hoof,Charlotte Fullerton,princess celestia,"Everything is fine, Mr. and Mrs. Cake."
A Bird in the Hoof,Charlotte Fullerton,fluttershy,Sorry I'm late. I had to finish taking care of a patient first.
A Bird in the Hoof,Charlotte Fullerton,twilight sparkle,"Oh, you and your tender loving care of little animals. I just know Princess Celestia is gonna love that about you. I mean, I hope she will... I mean, of course she will!"
A Bird in the Hoof,Charlotte Fullerton,fluttershy,"Wow, Twilight. I thought I was the only one who got nervous at social gatherings."
A Bird in the Hoof,Charlotte Fullerton,twilight sparkle,"Oh, it's not that. I just want the princess to approve of my friends."
A Bird in the Hoof,Charlotte Fullerton,fluttershy,But she's met us all before.
A Bird in the Hoof,Charlotte Fullerton,twilight sparkle,And read about you in my letters. But this is the first time she's spent any real time with you. I want everypony to make a good impression.
A Bird in the Hoof,Charlotte Fullerton,fluttershy,"Well, I'm sure you have nothing to worry about. Besides, it's just a casual get-together, right?"
A Bird in the Hoof,Charlotte Fullerton,rarity,"Don't touch me! Watch the dress! Careful, you're gonna spill that on me! Oh, oh, that looks delicious. What is it? Oh, does it stain?! Keep it away from me!"
A Bird in the Hoof,Charlotte Fullerton,fluttershy,Or... perhaps not that casual.
A Bird in the Hoof,Charlotte Fullerton,applejack,"Uh... which is the salad and which is the appetizer again? And which am I supposed to eat first? Oh, never mind. I'm not hungry."
A Bird in the Hoof,Charlotte Fullerton,fluttershy,"It's okay, Twilight. So our friends' manners aren't perfect. I doubt the princess will even notice."
A Bird in the Hoof,Charlotte Fullerton,pinkie pie,Hey!
A Bird in the Hoof,Charlotte Fullerton,mr. cake,"Mr. A thousand pardons, Your Majesty."
A Bird in the Hoof,Charlotte Fullerton,mrs. cake,Mrs. Empty teacup at 4 o'clock!
A Bird in the Hoof,Charlotte Fullerton,mr. cake,"Mr. Uh, I see it, honey bun!"
A Bird in the Hoof,Charlotte Fullerton,princess celestia,"Oh, um... thank you."
A Bird in the Hoof,Charlotte Fullerton,mr. cake,"Mr. Not at all, Your Highness."
A Bird in the Hoof,Charlotte Fullerton,princess celestia,[sips] Thank you again.
A Bird in the Hoof,Charlotte Fullerton,mrs. cake,"Mrs. Oh, but of course, Your Majesty."
A Bird in the Hoof,Charlotte Fullerton,princess celestia,[sips] [sips] [sips] Gotcha!
A Bird in the Hoof,Charlotte Fullerton,twilight sparkle,Oh...
A Bird in the Hoof,Charlotte Fullerton,princess celestia,"And what about you, dear? Fluttershy, is it?"
A Bird in the Hoof,Charlotte Fullerton,fluttershy,"Me? Oh yes, Your Highness."
A Bird in the Hoof,Charlotte Fullerton,princess celestia,I understand from Twilight Sparkle's letters that you enjoy tending to the needs of woodland creatures.
A Bird in the Hoof,Charlotte Fullerton,fluttershy,"Yes, I love to take care of animals."
A Bird in the Hoof,Charlotte Fullerton,princess celestia,"As do I. As Princess, I care deeply about all creatures, great and small."
A Bird in the Hoof,Charlotte Fullerton,princess celestia,Nothing means more to me than the well-being of all my subjects.
A Bird in the Hoof,Charlotte Fullerton,princess celestia,"Ah, Philomena, my pet. You're awake. Do say hello to our gracious hosts."
A Bird in the Hoof,Charlotte Fullerton,fluttershy,Oh... my.
A Bird in the Hoof,Charlotte Fullerton,princess celestia,"She is quite a sight, isn't she?"
A Bird in the Hoof,Charlotte Fullerton,fluttershy,I... I... I've never seen anything like it.
A Bird in the Hoof,Charlotte Fullerton,princess celestia,"Really? Well, if I must... I'm sorry, everypony. I'm afraid I have to cut the party short. The mayor has requested an audience with me. Royal duty calls. Thank you for a wonderful time. It's been a joy getting to know you all better."
A Bird in the Hoof,Charlotte Fullerton,applejack,Phew! Now I can eat someth'n! I'm starved! Oh...
A Bird in the Hoof,Charlotte Fullerton,rarity,"Stay right where you are. All I want is a clear path to the exit. Nobody move and my dress won't get hurt! Stay back! Back, I say!"
A Bird in the Hoof,Charlotte Fullerton,twilight sparkle,"[sigh] Well, Spike, I don't know for sure how things went with the princess, but at least no big disasters happened."
A Bird in the Hoof,Charlotte Fullerton,fluttershy,"Oh, you poor little thing. How did you ever get in such bad condition? Don't you worry, Philomena. I'll nurse you back to health. As a favor to the princess, who's obviously just far too busy to care for you properly."
A Bird in the Hoof,Charlotte Fullerton,fluttershy,This is far worse than I thought. What you need is some medicine. Stat!
A Bird in the Hoof,Charlotte Fullerton,fluttershy,"Here you go, Philomena. This will fix you right up."
A Bird in the Hoof,Charlotte Fullerton,fluttershy,Doctor Fluttershy expected that.
A Bird in the Hoof,Charlotte Fullerton,fluttershy,Always works. [gasp] Uh... Almost always.
A Bird in the Hoof,Charlotte Fullerton,fluttershy,"There's nothing like homemade soup to cure what ails you. Come on now. You're not gonna get better if you don't cooperate. Mmm... See? It's delicious. Good and good for you. Here comes the choo-choo train. Chugga-chugga, chugga-chugga, whoo-whoo!"
A Bird in the Hoof,Charlotte Fullerton,fluttershy,"Oh dear. Don't worry, Philomena. I know what'll make you feel better. Wait right here. I have just the thing."
A Bird in the Hoof,Charlotte Fullerton,fluttershy,"Look, Philomena. I brought a fellow feathered friend by to cheer you up. Hummingway here was sick once too, but he let me help him and got better in no time. Didn't you, boy?"
A Bird in the Hoof,Charlotte Fullerton,fluttershy,Say hello to your new friend Philomena.
A Bird in the Hoof,Charlotte Fullerton,fluttershy,"Your turn now, Philomena. Go ahead. You can do it. [vocalizes My Little Pony theme] Oh! Um... good try?"
A Bird in the Hoof,Charlotte Fullerton,fluttershy,"I know what'll clear up that tickle in your throat. A humidifier. [deep breath] Refreshing. How's that feeling now for you, Philomena? Better?"
A Bird in the Hoof,Charlotte Fullerton,fluttershy,Oh... That's okay. I know lots of other ways to take care of you. Don't worry. You're gonna get better. How about...
A Bird in the Hoof,Charlotte Fullerton,fluttershy,Aromatherapy?
A Bird in the Hoof,Charlotte Fullerton,fluttershy,Warm bath?
A Bird in the Hoof,Charlotte Fullerton,fluttershy,Ointment?
A Bird in the Hoof,Charlotte Fullerton,fluttershy,Scalpel. Surgical tape. Feathers.
A Bird in the Hoof,Charlotte Fullerton,fluttershy,"Oh, Philomena. I thought it would be easy to nurse you back to health. I've tried everything I know. And look at you. You're worse than ever."
A Bird in the Hoof,Charlotte Fullerton,twilight sparkle,"Hi, Fluttershy! I just wanted to drop by and say thank you so very much for making such a good impression on the princess today... [gasp] What is Celestia's pet doing here?!"
A Bird in the Hoof,Charlotte Fullerton,fluttershy,I couldn't leave the poor thing there. She needed my help.
A Bird in the Hoof,Charlotte Fullerton,twilight sparkle,Oh no. Nonononononono! This is bad.
A Bird in the Hoof,Charlotte Fullerton,fluttershy,How could I just walk away and not do anything?
A Bird in the Hoof,Charlotte Fullerton,twilight sparkle,But... but... she doesn't belong to you!
A Bird in the Hoof,Charlotte Fullerton,fluttershy,I had to do something.
A Bird in the Hoof,Charlotte Fullerton,twilight sparkle,Without telling anypony?! Without asking permission?!
A Bird in the Hoof,Charlotte Fullerton,fluttershy,But...
A Bird in the Hoof,Charlotte Fullerton,twilight sparkle,"I know you had good intentions, but you have got to return the princess's pet!"
A Bird in the Hoof,Charlotte Fullerton,fluttershy,But...
A Bird in the Hoof,Charlotte Fullerton,fluttershy,"[sigh] You're right. Okay, let's..."
A Bird in the Hoof,Charlotte Fullerton,fluttershy,...go.
A Bird in the Hoof,Charlotte Fullerton,twilight sparkle,It's that dry night air?
A Bird in the Hoof,Charlotte Fullerton,fluttershy,But it's daytime.
A Bird in the Hoof,Charlotte Fullerton,twilight sparkle,"Well... day air's even drier. You guards better be on your way if you're gonna find the princess's missing pet. Philomena, was it? Thank you ever so much for keeping me in the loop. Bye! [pants] Phew... What are you doing?!"
A Bird in the Hoof,Charlotte Fullerton,fluttershy,"Going to return Philomena, remember?"
A Bird in the Hoof,Charlotte Fullerton,twilight sparkle,We can't now!
A Bird in the Hoof,Charlotte Fullerton,fluttershy,Why not?
A Bird in the Hoof,Charlotte Fullerton,twilight sparkle,"You have no idea what the princess is gonna do if she finds you're the one who took her pet, do you?!"
A Bird in the Hoof,Charlotte Fullerton,fluttershy,Do you?
A Bird in the Hoof,Charlotte Fullerton,twilight sparkle,Well... no. But it can't be anything good. She might banish you from Equestria. Or throw you in a dungeon. Or banish you and then throw you in a dungeon in the place that she banishes you to!
A Bird in the Hoof,Charlotte Fullerton,fluttershy,You really think the princess would do that?
A Bird in the Hoof,Charlotte Fullerton,twilight sparkle,"Okay. Granted that probably won't happen, but do you wanna take any chances?"
A Bird in the Hoof,Charlotte Fullerton,fluttershy,All that really matters to me is that poor little Philomena here gets well.
A Bird in the Hoof,Charlotte Fullerton,twilight sparkle,That's very noble of you. I'll write to you when you're banished. Unless I'm banished too somewhere there's no post office. Then you'll have to write to me. Deal?
A Bird in the Hoof,Charlotte Fullerton,fluttershy,"Please, Twilight. You just have to help me get Philomena healthy and then we can return her to the princess. And everything will be fine."
A Bird in the Hoof,Charlotte Fullerton,twilight sparkle,Did you give her any kind of medicine?
A Bird in the Hoof,Charlotte Fullerton,fluttershy,"I tried to, but she wouldn't take it."
A Bird in the Hoof,Charlotte Fullerton,twilight sparkle,"[groan] Then you have to make her take it. You can't be such a pushover, Fluttershy! You need to show this patient who's the boss. Make her straighten up and fly right!"
A Bird in the Hoof,Charlotte Fullerton,fluttershy,She can't fly.
A Bird in the Hoof,Charlotte Fullerton,twilight sparkle,No excuses!
A Bird in the Hoof,Charlotte Fullerton,twilight sparkle,"Done. Okay, what else?"
A Bird in the Hoof,Charlotte Fullerton,fluttershy,"Uh... well, she keeps pulling her feathers off. The ones that haven't fallen out yet from all her coughing, I mean."
A Bird in the Hoof,Charlotte Fullerton,twilight sparkle,There you go.
A Bird in the Hoof,Charlotte Fullerton,fluttershy,I don't think she likes it.
A Bird in the Hoof,Charlotte Fullerton,twilight sparkle,"Tough love, baby. You want her to get well, don't you?"
A Bird in the Hoof,Charlotte Fullerton,fluttershy,"Of course, but..."
A Bird in the Hoof,Charlotte Fullerton,twilight sparkle,Next!
A Bird in the Hoof,Charlotte Fullerton,fluttershy,"Well, she desperately needs some bed rest, but I can't get her to stay put."
A Bird in the Hoof,Charlotte Fullerton,twilight sparkle,One step ahead of you.
A Bird in the Hoof,Charlotte Fullerton,fluttershy,"It's for your own good, Philomena, I promise. Please, just relax and try to get some sleep."
A Bird in the Hoof,Charlotte Fullerton,twilight sparkle,What's this soup over here? Smells delicious.
A Bird in the Hoof,Charlotte Fullerton,fluttershy,I made it for Philomena. But she wouldn't eat it.
A Bird in the Hoof,Charlotte Fullerton,twilight sparkle,"Oh, she'll eat it, all right."
A Bird in the Hoof,Charlotte Fullerton,twilight sparkle,Hey! Where are you going?
A Bird in the Hoof,Charlotte Fullerton,fluttershy,No! Philomena! Come back!
A Bird in the Hoof,Charlotte Fullerton,rainbow dash,"What are you two doing? Are you having a race? Oh, can I play? One, two, three, go!"
A Bird in the Hoof,Charlotte Fullerton,fluttershy,Excuse me!
A Bird in the Hoof,Charlotte Fullerton,pinkie pie,Hi!
A Bird in the Hoof,Charlotte Fullerton,twilight sparkle,Beg your pardon!
A Bird in the Hoof,Charlotte Fullerton,rarity,Put me down!
A Bird in the Hoof,Charlotte Fullerton,applejack,What in tarnation?!
A Bird in the Hoof,Charlotte Fullerton,fluttershy,"Sorry, but we've gotta find..."
A Bird in the Hoof,Charlotte Fullerton,fluttershy,"Philomena, come down from there! You'll hurt yourself!"
A Bird in the Hoof,Charlotte Fullerton,fluttershy,I'll catch you!
A Bird in the Hoof,Charlotte Fullerton,princess celestia,What is going on here? Twilight?
A Bird in the Hoof,Charlotte Fullerton,twilight sparkle,"Yes, your Majesty, there's been a terrible accident."
A Bird in the Hoof,Charlotte Fullerton,fluttershy,It's all my fault.
A Bird in the Hoof,Charlotte Fullerton,twilight sparkle,"No, Princess. Fluttershy didn't know any better. It was my fault."
A Bird in the Hoof,Charlotte Fullerton,fluttershy,I'm the one who did it.
A Bird in the Hoof,Charlotte Fullerton,twilight sparkle,But you were only trying to help.
A Bird in the Hoof,Charlotte Fullerton,fluttershy,Some help I was.
A Bird in the Hoof,Charlotte Fullerton,twilight sparkle,Will ya let me do this? She'll go easier on me.
A Bird in the Hoof,Charlotte Fullerton,fluttershy,But it's my fault!
A Bird in the Hoof,Charlotte Fullerton,twilight sparkle,"No, it's my fault!"
A Bird in the Hoof,Charlotte Fullerton,pinkie pie,"No, it's my fault! Wait, what are we talking about?"
A Bird in the Hoof,Charlotte Fullerton,fluttershy,"Thanks for trying to protect me, Twilight, but... Princess Celestia, I'm the one who took your pet bird. I really was only trying to help the poor little thing. Then I was gonna bring it right back to you, honest. So, if you wanna banish me and then throw me in a dungeon in the place that you banish me to, then that's what I deserve."
A Bird in the Hoof,Charlotte Fullerton,princess celestia,"Oh, stop fooling around, Philomena. You're scaring everypony."
A Bird in the Hoof,Charlotte Fullerton,fluttershy,I don't understand! What is that thing? What happened to Philomena?
A Bird in the Hoof,Charlotte Fullerton,princess celestia,"This is Philomena. She's quite a sight, as I said. But nothing unusual for a phoenix. Isn't that right, Philomena?"
A Bird in the Hoof,Charlotte Fullerton,fluttershy,A... A phoenix?
A Bird in the Hoof,Charlotte Fullerton,princess celestia,"A phoenix is a majestic and magical bird. While it appears healthy and happy most of the time, every so often it must renew itself by shedding all of its feathers and bursting into flame. [silently] Rather melodramatic, if you ask me. [loud again] It then rises from the ashes, fresh as a daisy. All just a normal part of the life cycle of a phoenix. I'm afraid mischievous little Philomena here took the occasion to have a little fun with you, Fluttershy. Say you're sorry, young lady."
A Bird in the Hoof,Charlotte Fullerton,fluttershy,So... aren't you gonna banish me? Or throw me in a dungeon? Or banish me and then throw me in a dungeon in the place that you banish me to?
A Bird in the Hoof,Charlotte Fullerton,princess celestia,"Of course not, my little pony. Where on Earth would you get such an idea?"
A Bird in the Hoof,Charlotte Fullerton,fluttershy,I guess I have some imagination.
A Bird in the Hoof,Charlotte Fullerton,twilight sparkle,Fluttershy really did do everything she could to try to take care of Philomena for you.
A Bird in the Hoof,Charlotte Fullerton,princess celestia,"And I do appreciate that your heart was in the right place, child. But all you had to do was ask me and I could have told you Philomena was a phoenix and saved you all this trouble."
A Bird in the Hoof,Charlotte Fullerton,fluttershy,I know. I shouldn't have jumped to conclusions. Next time I'll ask before taking matters into my own hooves.
A Bird in the Hoof,Charlotte Fullerton,twilight sparkle,"Should I write you a letter about that lesson, Princess?"
A Bird in the Hoof,Charlotte Fullerton,princess celestia,"No, that's quite all right. I think I can remember."
A Bird in the Hoof,Charlotte Fullerton,fluttershy,"It's beautiful. Thank you, Philomena. No hard feelings."
A Bird in the Hoof,Charlotte Fullerton,rainbow dash,"Hmm... [indistinct whispers] Hey, you know what you should do? You should go over there and tickle them!"
The Cutie Mark Chronicles,M. A. Larson,sweetie belle,"[gulp] Are you sure about this, Scootaloo? I've never even heard of a pony zip lining before."
The Cutie Mark Chronicles,M. A. Larson,scootaloo,"Neither have I, but Spike told me it was awesome!"
The Cutie Mark Chronicles,M. A. Larson,scootaloo,Whoa!
The Cutie Mark Chronicles,M. A. Larson,sweetie belle,Oh!
The Cutie Mark Chronicles,M. A. Larson,apple bloom,Wah!
The Cutie Mark Chronicles,M. A. Larson,cutie mark crusaders,Ow!
The Cutie Mark Chronicles,M. A. Larson,apple bloom,See anything?
The Cutie Mark Chronicles,M. A. Larson,scootaloo,Tree sap and pine needles but no cutie mark.
The Cutie Mark Chronicles,M. A. Larson,sweetie belle,Plan B?
The Cutie Mark Chronicles,M. A. Larson,scootaloo,"Yeah. You know where we can find a cannon at this hour? It's no use! No matter what we try, we always end up without our cutie marks. And, surprisingly often, covered in tree sap."
The Cutie Mark Chronicles,M. A. Larson,sweetie belle,"Maybe we should do something less dangerous, like pillow testing or flower sniffing."
The Cutie Mark Chronicles,M. A. Larson,apple bloom,This town is full of ponies who have their cutie marks. Why don't we ask them how they did it?
The Cutie Mark Chronicles,M. A. Larson,sweetie belle,That's a great safe idea.
The Cutie Mark Chronicles,M. A. Larson,scootaloo,Yeah! And we can start with the coolest pony in Ponyville.
The Cutie Mark Chronicles,M. A. Larson,apple bloom,Applejack!
The Cutie Mark Chronicles,M. A. Larson,sweetie belle,Rarity!
The Cutie Mark Chronicles,M. A. Larson,scootaloo,"Come on, guys, I said ""cool""! You know who I'm talking about. She's fast. She's tough. She's not afraid of anything!"
The Cutie Mark Chronicles,M. A. Larson,scootaloo,No! The greatest flyer ever to come out of Cloudsdale.
The Cutie Mark Chronicles,M. A. Larson,scootaloo,No! Rainbow Dash!
The Cutie Mark Chronicles,M. A. Larson,apple bloom,"Oh! Yeah, that makes much more sense."
The Cutie Mark Chronicles,M. A. Larson,sweetie belle,Of course!
The Cutie Mark Chronicles,M. A. Larson,scootaloo,Let's do it. Let's find out how Rainbow Dash earned her cutie mark!
The Cutie Mark Chronicles,M. A. Larson,sweetie belle,Aah! Uuh!
The Cutie Mark Chronicles,M. A. Larson,applejack,"Get back here, you thievin' varmints!"
The Cutie Mark Chronicles,M. A. Larson,apple bloom,Thievin' what now?
The Cutie Mark Chronicles,M. A. Larson,applejack,Apple Bloom?
The Cutie Mark Chronicles,M. A. Larson,apple bloom,Hey sis! How'd you get your cutie mark?
The Cutie Mark Chronicles,M. A. Larson,applejack,I never told you that story?
The Cutie Mark Chronicles,M. A. Larson,scootaloo,Hey! I thought we were gonna ask Rainbow Dash.
The Cutie Mark Chronicles,M. A. Larson,apple bloom,We need all the help we can get.
The Cutie Mark Chronicles,M. A. Larson,scootaloo,Ugh. Fine.
The Cutie Mark Chronicles,M. A. Larson,applejack,"Why, shoot. I was just a little filly. Even littler than y'all."
The Cutie Mark Chronicles,M. A. Larson,applejack,"[voiceover] I didn't want to spend my life on a muddy old apple farm. I wanted to live the sophisticated life, like my Aunt n' Uncle Orange. So I set out to try my luck in the big city, Manehattan! The most cosmopolitan city in all of Equestria."
The Cutie Mark Chronicles,M. A. Larson,applejack,[voiceover] I knew I'd find out who I was meant to be in Manehattan.
The Cutie Mark Chronicles,M. A. Larson,young applejack,Aunt Orange! Uncle Orange! Thank y'all so much for lettin' me stay!
The Cutie Mark Chronicles,M. A. Larson,young applejack,"Oh, it's simply divine."
The Cutie Mark Chronicles,M. A. Larson,young applejack,"Although, I must admit the city noise took some getting used to. Where I'm from, nights are so quiet, you seldom hear a peep until the roosters wake you."
The Cutie Mark Chronicles,M. A. Larson,young applejack,[voiceover] What's he talking about? What do I say? I don't wanna look like a fool.
The Cutie Mark Chronicles,M. A. Larson,young applejack,Thank goodness. Being a city pony's hard work. I'm so hungry I could eat a...
The Cutie Mark Chronicles,M. A. Larson,young applejack,"Cock-a-doodle-doo... Oh, I wonder what Granny Smith and Big McIntosh are up to. I bet they're applebuckin' their way through the Red Delicious trees. Oh, what I wouldn't give for just one bite..."
The Cutie Mark Chronicles,M. A. Larson,applejack,[voiceover] I never felt so homesick in all my days as I did right then.
The Cutie Mark Chronicles,M. A. Larson,applejack,"[voiceover] It was amazin'! A rainbow pointin' right back to... home. In that moment, it all became clear. I knew right then just who I was supposed to be. That's when this here appeared."
The Cutie Mark Chronicles,M. A. Larson,applejack,I've been happily workin' in the farm ever since.
The Cutie Mark Chronicles,M. A. Larson,applejack,"There they are! Get back here, ya thievin' varmints!"
The Cutie Mark Chronicles,M. A. Larson,sweetie belle,Aw. That was such a sweet story!
The Cutie Mark Chronicles,M. A. Larson,scootaloo,Sweet? Try sappy. [mock-gags] Come on! We've got to find Rainbow Dash and hear the cool way to get a cutie mark.
The Cutie Mark Chronicles,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,"All right, little ones. This way. This way. You really should be more careful. Somepony could get hurt. Why are you in such a hurry anyway?"
The Cutie Mark Chronicles,M. A. Larson,scootaloo,"We're trying to find Rainbow Dash, so we can hear how she earned her cutie mark."
The Cutie Mark Chronicles,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,"Oh, that would be interesting. You know, I wouldn't have gotten my cutie mark if it weren't for her."
The Cutie Mark Chronicles,M. A. Larson,scootaloo,Rainbow Dash?! Really?!
The Cutie Mark Chronicles,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,Oh yes. It all started at Summer Flight Camp.
The Cutie Mark Chronicles,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,"[voiceover] You'd never guess, but when I was little I was very shy. And a very weak flyer."
The Cutie Mark Chronicles,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,"[voiceover] It was the most humiliating moment of my life. And then, out of nowhere..."
The Cutie Mark Chronicles,M. A. Larson,young rainbow dash,Leave her alone!
The Cutie Mark Chronicles,M. A. Larson,young rainbow dash,Keep making fun of her and find out!
The Cutie Mark Chronicles,M. A. Larson,young rainbow dash,Whaddya have in mind?
The Cutie Mark Chronicles,M. A. Larson,young rainbow dash,"In history, maybe. See you boys at the finish line!"
The Cutie Mark Chronicles,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,[voiceover] I had never seen such beautiful creatures. Butterflies don't fly as high as my cloud home. And I'd never been near the ground before.
The Cutie Mark Chronicles,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,[voiceover] Somehow I had the ability to communicate with the animals on a different level.
The Cutie Mark Chronicles,M. A. Larson,scootaloo,"Wait, wait, wait. What happened to Rainbow Dash? What about the race?"
The Cutie Mark Chronicles,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,"Oh. Well, I wasn't there, so I don't really know what happened."
The Cutie Mark Chronicles,M. A. Larson,scootaloo,"Come on, Crusaders. We've gotta find her. Besides, I can't take anymore singing."
The Cutie Mark Chronicles,M. A. Larson,sweetie belle,"Maybe my sister knows where she is. Bye, Fluttershy!"
The Cutie Mark Chronicles,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,"Bye, girls!"
The Cutie Mark Chronicles,M. A. Larson,scootaloo,"How did we get roped into this? Oh, we'll never hear Rainbow Dash's story."
The Cutie Mark Chronicles,M. A. Larson,rarity,Are you girls still obsessing over your cutie marks?
The Cutie Mark Chronicles,M. A. Larson,sweetie belle,Of course! Most of the fillies at school already have theirs.
The Cutie Mark Chronicles,M. A. Larson,rarity,"Mmm, I know how you feel. For the longest time I couldn't figure out why I didn't have mine."
The Cutie Mark Chronicles,M. A. Larson,rarity,"[voiceover] I tried every trick I could think of, but nothing seemed to work. The costumes just weren't right. And the play opened that night."
The Cutie Mark Chronicles,M. A. Larson,rarity,[voiceover] I had no idea where my horn was taking me. But unicorn magic doesn't happen without a reason. I knew this had to do with my love of fashion and maybe even my cutie mark! I knew that this was... My destiny!
The Cutie Mark Chronicles,M. A. Larson,scootaloo,Ugh! These namby-pamby stories aren't getting us any closer to our cutie marks! They're all about finding who you really are and boring stuff like that.
The Cutie Mark Chronicles,M. A. Larson,rarity,"Yes, Scootaloo, that's exactly..."
The Cutie Mark Chronicles,M. A. Larson,scootaloo,"Come on, girls! We need action! We need Rainbow Dash!"
The Cutie Mark Chronicles,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"As a young filly in Canterlot, I always wanted to go to the Summer Sun Celebration, where Princess Celestia raises the sun."
The Cutie Mark Chronicles,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"[voiceover] And I saw the most amazing, most wonderful thing I've ever seen."
The Cutie Mark Chronicles,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,[voiceover] I poured myself into learning everything I could about magic.
The Cutie Mark Chronicles,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,[voiceover] My parents decided to enroll me in Princess Celestia's School for Gifted Unicorns. It was a dream come true! Except for one thing... I had to pass an entrance exam!
The Cutie Mark Chronicles,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"[voiceover] I knew it was the most important day of my life, that my entire future would be affected by the outcome of this day and I was about to blow it!"
The Cutie Mark Chronicles,M. A. Larson,princess celestia,Twilight Sparkle.
The Cutie Mark Chronicles,M. A. Larson,princess celestia,You have a very special gift. I don't think I've ever come across a unicorn with your raw abilities.
The Cutie Mark Chronicles,M. A. Larson,princess celestia,But you need to learn to tame these abilities through focused study.
The Cutie Mark Chronicles,M. A. Larson,princess celestia,"Twilight Sparkle, I'd like to make you my own personal prot<e9>g<e9> here at the school."
The Cutie Mark Chronicles,M. A. Larson,princess celestia,Well?
The Cutie Mark Chronicles,M. A. Larson,princess celestia,"One other thing, Twilight."
The Cutie Mark Chronicles,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,...yesyesyesyes...
The Cutie Mark Chronicles,M. A. Larson,apple bloom,"Okay, okay."
The Cutie Mark Chronicles,M. A. Larson,sweetie belle,"We're happy for you, Twilight."
The Cutie Mark Chronicles,M. A. Larson,scootaloo,"Yeah, thrilled. Let's get out of here while we still can."
The Cutie Mark Chronicles,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"...yesyes, yeeees!"
The Cutie Mark Chronicles,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,[giggle] Um... yes.
The Cutie Mark Chronicles,M. A. Larson,scootaloo,Ugh! Why don't we ever smash into Rainbow Dash?!
The Cutie Mark Chronicles,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,"You're looking for Rainbow Dash? If I was her, I'd be at Sugarcube Corner. Of course, if I was anyone, I'd be at Sugarcube Corner. Hey! I have an idea! Wanna go to Sugarcube Corner?"
The Cutie Mark Chronicles,M. A. Larson,sweetie belle,"Well, we're sort of looking for Rainbow Dash, so we can hear how she got her cutie mark."
The Cutie Mark Chronicles,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,Cutie mark? Come with me and I'll tell you how I got mine!
The Cutie Mark Chronicles,M. A. Larson,scootaloo,[sigh] Why not?
The Cutie Mark Chronicles,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,All right!
The Cutie Mark Chronicles,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,"[voiceover] My sisters and I were raised on a rock farm outside of Ponyville. We spent our days working the fields. There was no talking. There was no smiling. [sigh] There were only rocks. We were in the south field, preparing to rotate the rocks to the east field when all of a sudden..."
The Cutie Mark Chronicles,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,"[voiceover] I'd never felt joy like that before! It felt so good I just wanted to keep smiling forever! And I wanted everyone I knew to smile too, but rainbows don't come along that often. I wondered, how else could I create some smiles?"
The Cutie Mark Chronicles,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,And that's how Equestria was made!
The Cutie Mark Chronicles,M. A. Larson,scootaloo,Wha... huh?
The Cutie Mark Chronicles,M. A. Larson,apple bloom,Look! We're here!
The Cutie Mark Chronicles,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,Maybe on the way home I can tell you the story of how I got my cutie mark. It's a gem!
The Cutie Mark Chronicles,M. A. Larson,sweetie belle,"Oh, come on. She's just being Pinkie Pie."
The Cutie Mark Chronicles,M. A. Larson,scootaloo,Ugh...
The Cutie Mark Chronicles,M. A. Larson,scootaloo,Rainbow Dash! You're here!
The Cutie Mark Chronicles,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,I hear you're looking for my cutie mark story.
The Cutie Mark Chronicles,M. A. Larson,scootaloo,[sigh] You have no idea what I've been through today to hear that story.
The Cutie Mark Chronicles,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,It all happened during the race at Flight Camp...
The Cutie Mark Chronicles,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,[voiceover] ...where I stood alone against all odds to defend Fluttershy's honor.
The Cutie Mark Chronicles,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,"[voiceover] I've never flown like that before! That freedom was unlike anything I've ever felt! The speed, the adrenaline, the wind in my mane... I liked it... a lot!"
The Cutie Mark Chronicles,M. A. Larson,young rainbow dash,Ow!
The Cutie Mark Chronicles,M. A. Larson,young rainbow dash,Hey!
The Cutie Mark Chronicles,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,[voiceover] Turns out the only thing I liked more than flying fast... was winning!
The Cutie Mark Chronicles,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,[voiceover] Most people thought that the sonic rainboom was just an old mare's tale. But that day... The day I discovered racing... I proved that the legends were true. I made the impossible happen!
The Cutie Mark Chronicles,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,"And that, little ones, is how you earn a cutie mark."
The Cutie Mark Chronicles,M. A. Larson,cutie mark crusaders,Whooooaaaa...
The Cutie Mark Chronicles,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,"Wait a second. I heard that explosion. And I saw the rainbow too. Rainbow Dash, if you hadn't scared the animals, I never would have learned I could communicate with them and gotten my cutie mark."
The Cutie Mark Chronicles,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,"I heard that boom! And right afterwards, there was this amazing rainbow that taught me to smile."
The Cutie Mark Chronicles,M. A. Larson,applejack,"When I got my cutie mark, I saw a rainbow that pointed me home. I bet it was your sonic rainboom!"
The Cutie Mark Chronicles,M. A. Larson,rarity,There was an explosion I could never explain when I got my cutie mark.
The Cutie Mark Chronicles,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"This is uncanny! If that explosion didn't happen when it did, I would have blown my entrance exam. Rainbow Dash, I think you helped me earn my cutie mark too!"
The Cutie Mark Chronicles,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,Whoa!
The Cutie Mark Chronicles,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,We all owe our cutie marks to you!
The Cutie Mark Chronicles,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,Do you realize what this means? All of us had a special connection before we even met.
The Cutie Mark Chronicles,M. A. Larson,rarity,We've been BFFs forever and we didn't even know it!
The Cutie Mark Chronicles,M. A. Larson,applejack,"Come here, y'all."
The Cutie Mark Chronicles,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,I'm so glad we're friends!
The Cutie Mark Chronicles,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,"I love you, guys!"
The Cutie Mark Chronicles,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,Hey. How about a song?
The Cutie Mark Chronicles,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,Definitely!
The Cutie Mark Chronicles,M. A. Larson,scootaloo,Nooooo!
The Cutie Mark Chronicles,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Dear Princess Celestia,"
The Cutie Mark Chronicles,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Today I learned something amazing. Everypony everywhere has a special magical connection with her friends, maybe even before she's met them. If you're feeling lonely and you're still searching for your true friends, just look up in the sky. Who knows? Maybe you and your future best friends are all looking at the same rainbow."
The Cutie Mark Chronicles,M. A. Larson,spike,Gross! When did you get so cheesy?
The Cutie Mark Chronicles,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Just write it, Spike."
Owl's Well That Ends Well,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,This meteor shower tonight's gonna be amazing!
Owl's Well That Ends Well,Cindy Morrow,spike,Awesome!
Owl's Well That Ends Well,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,"You know, this shower only happens once every 100 years."
Owl's Well That Ends Well,Cindy Morrow,spike,A centennial celebration!
Owl's Well That Ends Well,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,We better get a move on!
Owl's Well That Ends Well,Cindy Morrow,spike,"Don't wanna be late! Whoa, whoa, whoa! [sigh] There."
Owl's Well That Ends Well,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,"Spike, did you grab my quill and ink?"
Owl's Well That Ends Well,Cindy Morrow,spike,Check!
Owl's Well That Ends Well,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,Scrolls?
Owl's Well That Ends Well,Cindy Morrow,spike,"Check! I've also packed a telescope, apples, bananas, fruit punch, and my freshly baked homemade triple-decker nut-crazy vanilla cream cookies!"
Owl's Well That Ends Well,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,"[giggle] I can see that. Once again you've read my mind, Spike. And that is why you are my number one assistant."
Owl's Well That Ends Well,Cindy Morrow,spike,I'm sorry. I didn't hear you.
Owl's Well That Ends Well,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,That is why you are my number one assistant.
Owl's Well That Ends Well,Cindy Morrow,spike,Missed that! Huh...?
Owl's Well That Ends Well,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,"I said... [giggle] Come on, let's get going. Wait! I almost forgot! I wanna bring the ""Astronomical Astronomer's Almanac to All Things Astronomy""."
Owl's Well That Ends Well,Cindy Morrow,spike,The Astronomo-lomo homono what?
Owl's Well That Ends Well,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,"You know that really old big blue book on stars, moons, planets, the universe...?"
Owl's Well That Ends Well,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,Hey! What's taking my number one assistant so long?
Owl's Well That Ends Well,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,I was sure I put the astronomer's guide back. The book would have helped me identify different planets and stars tonight.
Owl's Well That Ends Well,Cindy Morrow,spike,"Well... Maybe someone borrowed it? Besides, you don't need that book. You can already name all the planets and stars, 'cause you're super smart and astronomically awesome!"
Owl's Well That Ends Well,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,"Thanks, Spike. You're such a flatterer."
Owl's Well That Ends Well,Cindy Morrow,spike,"Yeah, I'm a sweet talker."
Owl's Well That Ends Well,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,"And a number one assistant, right?"
Owl's Well That Ends Well,Cindy Morrow,spike,Check!
Owl's Well That Ends Well,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,"[munch] [gulp] Wow, Twilight! You're lucky to have such a rad assistant. I wish I had someone to do whatever I told them."
Owl's Well That Ends Well,Cindy Morrow,scootaloo,"Ooh! Ooh! Me! Me! Me! I'll do whatever you want, Rainbow Dash!"
Owl's Well That Ends Well,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,"Oh yeah, pipsqueak? How about taking out the trash?"
Owl's Well That Ends Well,Cindy Morrow,scootaloo,Yes ma'am!
Owl's Well That Ends Well,Cindy Morrow,rarity,Do we have Spike to thank again for this amazing spread? Isn't he simply amazing?
Owl's Well That Ends Well,Cindy Morrow,spike,"Oh, come on. [pause] I said come on."
Owl's Well That Ends Well,Cindy Morrow,pinkie pie,Little Spikey-wikey! Who knew that big ferocious dragon started off so cutesy wootsy?
Owl's Well That Ends Well,Cindy Morrow,rarity,"Spike, you are such a little star that I had to make a little bow tie for you."
Owl's Well That Ends Well,Cindy Morrow,spike,"Gosh. You guys are embarrassing me. Stop it. [pause] Twilight, your turn."
Owl's Well That Ends Well,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,"Spike, that's enough."
Owl's Well That Ends Well,Cindy Morrow,spike,"Oh, right. That's enough."
Owl's Well That Ends Well,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,"Hey, everypony! The show is starting!"
Owl's Well That Ends Well,Cindy Morrow,spike,[yawn] Huh?
Owl's Well That Ends Well,Cindy Morrow,pinkie pie,Mmm. Wow! These cookies are delish!
Owl's Well That Ends Well,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,"Spike made them. Speaking of, Spike, can you bring us some punch? Spike?"
Owl's Well That Ends Well,Cindy Morrow,rarity,"Oh, poor little thing."
Owl's Well That Ends Well,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,Aww... He's worked himself to the bone.
Owl's Well That Ends Well,Cindy Morrow,pinkie pie,"And now the punch has been... ""spiked""!"
Owl's Well That Ends Well,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,"Goodnight, Spike. [giggle] Sweet dreams, number one assistant. [sigh] ""The Study of Comets. Comets are small, irregularly shaped bodies that are made of nonvolatile grains and frozen gases. They..."""
Owl's Well That Ends Well,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,"Huh.<U+00A0>""...have body structures that are fragile and diverse..."""
Owl's Well That Ends Well,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,Shoot! Oh... This is a job for Spike. If only he were awake...
Owl's Well That Ends Well,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,Wait! Don't go! Don't be afraid. Thank you for returning my scroll.
Owl's Well That Ends Well,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,"Gosh, it's cold tonight. Say, would you like to relax in here and keep me company while I work?"
Owl's Well That Ends Well,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,"Now, where was I? Oh, yes. ""...fragile and diverse with a surrounding cloud of material called a coma, that grows in size and brightness as the comet approaches the sun..."""
Owl's Well That Ends Well,Cindy Morrow,spike,"[snoring] Huh? Waah! I overslept! I know it's already ten, but I'm scaly-tailed and bright-eyed and ready to work twice as fast! Oh please, don't be upset, Twilight! And what do you want for breakfast? Oatmeal? How about a sunflower smoothie? Grass pancakes?"
Owl's Well That Ends Well,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,"Spike, don't worry."
Owl's Well That Ends Well,Cindy Morrow,spike,But my morning chores...
Owl's Well That Ends Well,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,It's okay. Owlowiscious did them for you.
Owl's Well That Ends Well,Cindy Morrow,spike,Who?
Owl's Well That Ends Well,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,He's our new junior assistant. He's gonna help out with your chores so you won't be so tired all the time.
Owl's Well That Ends Well,Cindy Morrow,spike,"Wha... Wh... What do we need a junior assistant for? I'm not tired. I do fine on my own. I don't need sleep, I..."
Owl's Well That Ends Well,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,"Spike, don't worry. He's just here to help out a little. Now, I have to go out, so why don't you introduce yourself to Owlowiscious? He's in the library."
Owl's Well That Ends Well,Cindy Morrow,spike,"Worried? Do I look worried? I'm not worried. Who's worried? Hello? Hellooo! Whoa! Dude, that's creepy. Uh... Hi there! I'm Spike. I'm sure Twilight has told you all about me."
Owl's Well That Ends Well,Cindy Morrow,spike,"Uh, Spike? You know, assistant number one?"
Owl's Well That Ends Well,Cindy Morrow,spike,I'm Spike! And who are you? What are you?
Owl's Well That Ends Well,Cindy Morrow,spike,Who?
Owl's Well That Ends Well,Cindy Morrow,spike,I thought your name was Owlowiscious!
Owl's Well That Ends Well,Cindy Morrow,spike,"Okay, ""Who"", ""Owlowiscious"", whatever. I'm Spike, okay? Look! All you need to know is that I'm number one and you're number two. Got it?"
Owl's Well That Ends Well,Cindy Morrow,spike,"So, a man of mystery, huh? I'm keeping my eye on you! I've got eyes in the back of my head too, you know? [crash] Well, not really, but... You know what I mean!"
Owl's Well That Ends Well,Cindy Morrow,spike,That bird is out for my job. He wants to be number one. I'll prove to Twilight that I deserve to be number one. Not Freaky Feathers over there. I won't let him have my job if it's the last thing I do!
Owl's Well That Ends Well,Cindy Morrow,pinkie pie,"Oh, what a fantastical, flufflicious feathery little friend! I'm... Hooked!"
Owl's Well That Ends Well,Cindy Morrow,fluttershy,He's just wonderful.
Owl's Well That Ends Well,Cindy Morrow,spike,"[mocking] ""He's just wonderful."" Uh, yes. Wonderful. He's quite... the charmer."
Owl's Well That Ends Well,Cindy Morrow,rarity,And Owlowiscious is just such a star I just had to make this little bow for you.
Owl's Well That Ends Well,Cindy Morrow,spike,Grrr!
Owl's Well That Ends Well,Cindy Morrow,applejack,What's he all saddle sore about?
Owl's Well That Ends Well,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,He's probably just jealous of Owlowiscious.
Owl's Well That Ends Well,Cindy Morrow,fluttershy,Maybe Spike feels threatened or worried that Owlowiscious will replace him?
Owl's Well That Ends Well,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,Replace him? Hah! That's crazy! Spike knows he can't be replaced.
Owl's Well That Ends Well,Cindy Morrow,spike,They're trying to replace me! I better step it up and make sure that Twilight and Owlowiscious know that I'm still number one!
Owl's Well That Ends Well,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,"Hey, Spike! Can you fetch me that book called ""Two-headed Myth<U+0097>"
Owl's Well That Ends Well,Cindy Morrow,spike,"...Mythological Mysteries!"" I know where it is."
Owl's Well That Ends Well,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,"Thanks, Owlowiscious. Hey, Spike, no worries. Owlowiscious flew up and got the book for me. Oh, and gee! I guess I need ""Ferrets of Fairyland"" too."
Owl's Well That Ends Well,Cindy Morrow,spike,Hey! Whoa! Whoa!
Owl's Well That Ends Well,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,Climb down from there before you fall.
Owl's Well That Ends Well,Cindy Morrow,spike,Grrr!
Owl's Well That Ends Well,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,Shoot!
Owl's Well That Ends Well,Cindy Morrow,spike,"Yes, sir!"
Owl's Well That Ends Well,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,My last writing quill. It's broken.
Owl's Well That Ends Well,Cindy Morrow,spike,"Never fear! Spike, your number one assistant, is here! [under his breath] Quill... Quill... Where is it? Not here... Quill... Quill, where is it...?"
Owl's Well That Ends Well,Cindy Morrow,spike,Where am I gonna get a quill?
Owl's Well That Ends Well,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,"Spike, wait! Wait!"
Owl's Well That Ends Well,Cindy Morrow,spike,"But the store is called ""Quills and Sofas"". You only sell two things!"
Owl's Well That Ends Well,Cindy Morrow,pinkie pie,"I swore I had one here somewhere. Ah, here it is! A quince!"
Owl's Well That Ends Well,Cindy Morrow,spike,Not a quince. A quill!
Owl's Well That Ends Well,Cindy Morrow,spike,Not a quiche. [pronounced correctly] A quill!
Owl's Well That Ends Well,Cindy Morrow,pinkie pie,Nope. Sorry. All outta quills.
Owl's Well That Ends Well,Cindy Morrow,spike,[sigh] Shoot.
Owl's Well That Ends Well,Cindy Morrow,spike,"Come on, chicken! Here, chicky-chicky-chicky! Here, chick-chick-chick-chicky! Come here! Ugh! Come here! [grunting] Not the face, not the face! No! Hey! Stop! Quit it!"
Owl's Well That Ends Well,Cindy Morrow,spike,[panting] Spike... to the rescue.
Owl's Well That Ends Well,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,"Oh, Spike. I was calling out for you when you were turning this place upside down. Owlowiscious gave me one of his feathers to use as a quill."
Owl's Well That Ends Well,Cindy Morrow,spike,"That's just great. Perfect! Sweet! I think I'll just, uh... finish up the rest of my chores! Or did Owlowiscious already do them?"
Owl's Well That Ends Well,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,"Oh, no no. There are quite a lot of them."
Owl's Well That Ends Well,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,Poor Spike. He'll come around. He's genuinely a good little guy.
Owl's Well That Ends Well,Cindy Morrow,spike,Huh?
Owl's Well That Ends Well,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,"Spike. What is this? You said this book was missing. Well, Owlowiscious found it right where it belongs, but like this. How did it get this way?"
Owl's Well That Ends Well,Cindy Morrow,spike,"Uh... Well, um... You see, I... I just didn't wanna disappoint you and, uh... Have you ever seen a dragon sneeze?"
Owl's Well That Ends Well,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,"I've seen a dragon lie. I'm very disappointed in you, Spike."
Owl's Well That Ends Well,Cindy Morrow,spike,"[to Owlowiscious] You set me up! Well, two can play that game."
Owl's Well That Ends Well,Cindy Morrow,spike,"Not ""who""! Two! Urgh!"
Owl's Well That Ends Well,Cindy Morrow,spike,"Owlowiscious is out to take my place, I just know it! I've gotta stop him. But how?"
Owl's Well That Ends Well,Cindy Morrow,spike,Ah... Muahahaha!
Owl's Well That Ends Well,Cindy Morrow,rarity,"Come along, Opal. Let's hurry up and get to Fluttershy's tea party."
Owl's Well That Ends Well,Cindy Morrow,spike,"So lifelike. And when Twilight discovers it shredded up on her floor, she'll think mouse-eating Owlowiscious is to blame. And I'll be number one... again! Muhahaha!"
Owl's Well That Ends Well,Cindy Morrow,spike,"[evil laugh]<U+00A0>That poor little field mouse! Torn to pieces! It must have been Owlowiscious! You know, since owls eat, you know, mice. What a terrible, terrible bird! He must be punished! Right?"
Owl's Well That Ends Well,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,"Spike! I don't know what upsets me more. That you deliberately tried to set up Owlowiscious or that you actually thought this pathetic attempt would work! You've let your jealousy get the best of you, Spike. I am truly disappointed. This is not the Spike I know and love."
Owl's Well That Ends Well,Cindy Morrow,spike,She... She doesn't love me anymore.
Owl's Well That Ends Well,Cindy Morrow,spike,"Twilight hates me. I'm cold, hungry, tired and lonely. Could it get any worse?"
Owl's Well That Ends Well,Cindy Morrow,spike,I guess that's a yes.<U+00A0>Hello? Hello?
Owl's Well That Ends Well,Cindy Morrow,spike,"What is that?<U+00A0>If this is what running away is all about, I never wanna go home! Gems! Mmm... Woohoo!"
Owl's Well That Ends Well,Cindy Morrow,spike,"[hiccup] Even if my tummy's full, the rest of me is still empty. I miss Twilight and the pony gang. But she doesn't love me anymore. So, I'm better off here, all by myself. Wow. Seems to be getting warmer. The steam is great for my complexion, but it's sure getting hot in here."
Owl's Well That Ends Well,Cindy Morrow,spike,"Heyah bro! I didn't know this was your cave. And I didn't know these were your gems, but... we're cool, right?"
Owl's Well That Ends Well,Cindy Morrow,spike,"Whoa, whoa! Hey... We're like brothers, you know? I mean, you're a dragon, I'm a dragon... It's us against the world, right?"
Owl's Well That Ends Well,Cindy Morrow,spike,You don't scare me! So you're big.
Owl's Well That Ends Well,Cindy Morrow,spike,"Really big. And your claws are super sharp. Tail... extra spiky. But, uh... You don't scare me! Ha! How'd you like that? Uh... I'd love to stay, but gotta go! See ya! Wouldn't wanna be ya! Aah!"
Owl's Well That Ends Well,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,Spike! Over here!
Owl's Well That Ends Well,Cindy Morrow,spike,Am I glad to see you!
Owl's Well That Ends Well,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,Hurry! Hop on! It's too dark! I can't see!
Owl's Well That Ends Well,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,[pants] Spike. We were so worried about you. I was so worried about you. Why did you run away?
Owl's Well That Ends Well,Cindy Morrow,spike,I thought you didn't need me anymore. And that you didn't love me anymore.
Owl's Well That Ends Well,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,"Spike. Sure, I was disappointed, but you are my number one assistant! And friend. And you always will be. It's just that sometimes I need some help at night. I can't ask you to stay up late. You're a baby dragon and you need your rest. Owls are nocturnal. So I asked Owlowiscious to help. But not to take your place. No one could ever replace you, Spike. Not even when you are being a jealous numbskull."
Owl's Well That Ends Well,Cindy Morrow,spike,"I'm sorry, Twilight. I never should have been so jealous."
Owl's Well That Ends Well,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,"And I'm sorry too, Spike. I should have been more sensitive."
Owl's Well That Ends Well,Cindy Morrow,spike,And Owlowiscious... I know now that you weren't out to take my job. Forgive me?
Owl's Well That Ends Well,Cindy Morrow,spike,"Me. Forgive me, Spike."
Owl's Well That Ends Well,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,"[giggle] He forgives you, Spike."
Owl's Well That Ends Well,Cindy Morrow,spike,Hey! How did you guys know where I was?
Owl's Well That Ends Well,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,It was your ketchup-covered feet. Owlowiscious discovered your footprints and we followed them all the way to the cave.
Owl's Well That Ends Well,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,I know Princess Celestia will wanna read about what happened today...
Owl's Well That Ends Well,Cindy Morrow,spike,I'm ready when you are.
Owl's Well That Ends Well,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,"Hey, Spike. Why don't you write to Princess Celestia? And tell her what you've learned?"
Owl's Well That Ends Well,Cindy Morrow,spike,"Really? Why, that's a big responsibility!"
Owl's Well That Ends Well,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,I know. But nothing my number one assistant can't handle.
Owl's Well That Ends Well,Cindy Morrow,spike,"Dear Princess Celestia,"
Owl's Well That Ends Well,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,"Oh, Spike."
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"Oh! Hi, Pinkie Pie..."
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,This is your singing telegram I hope it finds you well You're invited to a party 'Cause we think you're really swell
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,"[rasping voice] Next time, I think I'll just pass out written invitations."
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,"Nice one! Now, let me show you how it's really done."
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,"Hey, girls!"
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,"Hey, Pinkie Pie!"
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,applejack,Howdy!
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,[squeal] Just wanted to tell you how happy I am that you could make it to Gummy's party.
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,applejack,Are you kiddin'? I wouldn't have missed it for the world.
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,"Me neither. When Pinkie Pie throws a party, I am there! Ta-da!"
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,"Aw! It's just a boring old apple. Don't worry, there are plenty of other surprises in there."
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,[spits] What kind of surprises?
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,"I can't tell you that, silly. Then it wouldn't be a surprise."
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"This punch is simply divine. Is this the same recipe you used for your ""Spring Has Sprung"" party?"
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,Nope! Something new.
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,It's Gummy's favorite.
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,"Ooh, this is my jam!"
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,Having fun?
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,A blast!
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,"You always throw the best parties, Pinkie Pie."
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,They're always the best parties 'cause my best friends are always there!
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Yah!
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,"C'mon, everypony! Gummy wants to dance! Go, Gummy! It's your birthday! Go, Gummy! It's your birthday!"
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,applejack,"Hoo-wee! I am beat! I haven't danced that much since... Well, since your last party. Thanks again for the invite!"
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,"See ya later, birthday alligator!"
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,Bravo for hosting yet another delightful soiree.
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,It's been lovely.
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,You sure you don't wanna stay? There's still some cake left.
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"Uh, I think I'm gonna pass. Great party though. We should do this again soon."
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,[gasp] We should do this again soon!
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"Oh! Hi, Pinki-"
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,It's soon!
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Pardon me?
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,"You said we should have another party soon, and... it's soon! Here's your invitation!"
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"""You're invited to Gummy's 'after-birthday' party. This afternoon at 3 o'clock."""
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,"All our bestest friends are invited, and there's gonna be dancing, and games, and cake, and ice-cream, and punch!"
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"This afternoon? As in, ""this afternoon"" this afternoon?"
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,"Yes, indeedy!"
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"Oh, gosh. I wish I could make it, but I've gotten a bit behind in my studies. I've really gotta hit the books."
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,"I understand. Your studies come first. But don't worry, we'll be sure to save you some cake."
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Please do.
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,"Oh! And Twilight, you shouldn't hit the books. You should really just read them."
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,I'll keep that in mind.
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,applejack,"Huh? Oh, hi, Pinkie Pie! What brings you 'round these parts?"
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,"Who's ready to shake their hoof-thang?! It's an invitation to Gummy's ""after-birthday"" party this afternoon. There's gonna be dancing, and games, and cake, and ice-cream, and punch!"
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,applejack,"This afternoon? A-as in, ""this afternoon"" this afternoon?"
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,"That's funny. That's just what Twilight said, and the answer is, ""Yes! It's this afternoon!"""
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,applejack,"Uh, well, I... I... uh... I don't think I can make it 'cause... uh... I have to... uh... uh, you know what? I... uh... pick apples! Yep, apples! 'Cause that's what we do! With the... apples. We, uh... pick 'em!"
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,"Okey-dokey-lokey! A party is still a party, even if there are only three guests."
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,spike,"[grunts] Anything else I can do for you, most beautiful one?"
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,[sniff] [whimper] Hmm... perhaps you could take a bath. How do I put this delicately? You smell like a rotten apple core that's been wrapped in moldy hay and dipped in dragon perspiration.
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,Ooh! Love the new hat. Very modern. What's the occasion?
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,"Gummy's ""after-birthday"" party is this afternoon. I'm delivering the invitations."
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"The party is this afternoon? As in, ""this afternoon"" this afternoon?"
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,It's so strange. Everypony keeps saying that.
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,Oh... do they?
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,"I know it's short notice, but we had such a great time at his birthday party, I thought we could have even more fun at his after-birthday party."
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"And I'm sure that we would, but I'm going to have to decline. I have to... wash my hair!"
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,"Don't be silly, your hair doesn't look dirty."
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,It doesn't?
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,Nope!
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,See? [gag] Dirty! I have to go!
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,"Huh... No Twilight, no Applejack, no Rarity. Oh well, a party is still a party even with only two guests."
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,This afternoon?
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,As in...?
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,"Yes! As in, ""this afternoon"" this afternoon!"
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,"Oh, man! We'd love to, but... we're... house-sitting this afternoon."
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,[sigh] Both of you?
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,It's... uh... a big house.
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,"Uh, look at the time! We'd really better get going."
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,Wait! Maybe I could bring you some after-birthday cake and ice-cream. Who're you house-sitting for?
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,Harry.
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,Harry?
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,"Yeah, I don't think you know him."
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,That's strange. I know just about everypony around here.
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,He's... a bear.
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,A bear?
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,"Yup! He's a bear all right, and he'll be pretty upset if we don't get over to his house soon."
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,Wait! There's a bear around here who lives in a house?
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,"It's, uh, really more of a cave."
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,"But he's fixed up the place so much, it feels like a house."
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,"And, uh, he wants us to look after his house... uh, cave... while he's, uh..."
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,A-at the beach!
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,He's vacationing at the beach?
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,Yup! He loves to...
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,Gotta go!
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,"Something strange is definitely going on around here, Gummy. Sure Rainbow Dash and Fluttershy had to house-sit for that vacationing bear, but what are the chances all my other friends would have plans this afternoon too? Rarity has to wash her hair? Applejack has to pick apples? Twilight is behind on her studies and has to hit the books? The more I think about it, the more those are starting to sound like... [gasp] excuses!"
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,That doesn't look like studying... or hitting!
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,mrs. cake,Mrs. Ooh! You must be here for...
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Shh! Is Pinkie Pie around?
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,mrs. cake,"Mrs. Oh, I don't think so."
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Good. I don't wanna her to know anything about this.
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,mrs. cake,"Mrs. Yes, of course. I'll be right back."
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,But... we're friends. What wouldn't Twilight want me to know anything about? [gasp] She's coming back.
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,mrs. cake,Mrs. There you go.
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,Time to get to the bottom of things! [gasp] I think our cover's been blown! We'll need a new disguise.
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"She didn't see you at the sweet shop, did she?"
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,I don't think so.
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"Oh, good. I'd hate for her to ruin everything."
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Me too.
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,Have you seen her?
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,Not since this morning.
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,Me neither. Can you believe she was planning on throwing an after-birthday party today?
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,I'm just glad I was able to come up with an excuse for why I couldn't be there.
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,Me too! This is obviously going to be so much better.
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,"As long as we keep her from finding out about it, it will."
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,[whispering] See you later!
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,I thought everypony loved my parties.
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,"Hi, Pinkie Pie! Uh-oh!"
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,Rainbow Dash! Wait!
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,Phew...
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,Where're you going?!
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,Ah!
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,What's the real reason you didn't want to come to Gummy's party?!
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,What's in those bags?!
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,Applejack! We have a problem!
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,I know you're IN THERE!
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,applejack,"Oh! Howdy, pardner!"
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,Mind if I... take a look inside the barn?
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,applejack,"No! Uh, I mean, yes, I mean... you can't come in here!"
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,Rainbow Dash just went in there.
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,applejack,"Oh, well, she was just bringin' in some... supplies! Yup, supplies for the... renovation! Fixin' up the whole thing, top to bottom... uh, lots of construction goin' on in there right now."
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,[whispering] You heard her! Construction!
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,Okey... dokey... lokey.
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,"Secrets and lies! It's all secrets and lies with those ponies! They're up to something, Gummy! Something they don't want me to know about! Well, I'm gonna know about it! I'm gonna know about it big time! And I know just who's gonna tell me all about it. Tell me all about it big time!"
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,spike,Wow! Nice spread!
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,"It's all yours, Spike. All you have to do is talk."
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,spike,"That's it? Oh, you got it. Okay... uh, beautiful weather we're having, eh? I love a sunny spring day, don't you? The birds chirpin' and the flowers bloomin'."
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,"No, no, no. Talk about our friends."
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,spike,"Oh, okay. Let's see, there's Twilight Sparkle. She's a unicorn. Good with magic. A real brainiac. And then you got Rarity. Total knockout. Twilight seems to think I don't even have a chance with her, but... eh, what does she know? Let's see. There's... there's Fluttershy, a Pegasus who's afraid of heights. Heh, what's up with that?"
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,Grr! No! You're not understanding me! I want you to confess!
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,spike,Confess?
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,Confess!
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,spike,"I'm the one who spilled juice all over Twilight's copy of ""Magical Mysteries and Practical Potions""!"
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,And?
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,spike,And I'm the one who used up all the hot water in Ponyville yesterday when I took a seven-hour bubble bath!
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,Aaand?
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,spike,"And sometimes... when no one's around... I do this: Lookin' good, Spike! Lookin' real good!"
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,No! No! No! No!
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,spike,"W-What do you wanna hear? Tell me what you want me to say, and I'll say it!"
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,spike,Your friends are all lying to you and avoiding you 'cause they don't like your parties and they don't want to be your friends anymore!
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,"Aha! I knew it! [balloon deflating noise] Oh no, my friends don't like my parties and they don't want to be my friends anymore."
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,Thank you all so much for coming! It means so much to Gummy.
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,"Why, thank you, Rocky."
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,"Anything for you, Madame le Flour."
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,"Oh, they're not so bad."
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,"Oh, c'mon now. ""Losers"" might be a little strong, dont'cha think?"
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,"Well, it was pretty rude..."
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,"It was, wasn't it?"
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,You know what? I'm not gonna speak to them ever again. And I'm not gonna invite them to another party as long as I live! They don't deserve to be invited to my parties. [plink] Not after the way they've been acting.
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,Who could that be?
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,"Hey there, Pinkie Pie! Sorry I was in such a rush earlier. Had some place to be and couldn't slow down and say, ""Hello."" You know how it goes."
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,"I know how it goes, all right!"
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,"Yeah... so, why don't you come with me over to Sweet Apple Acres?"
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,"No thanks. I'm spending time with my real friends. Isn't that right, Madame le Flour?"
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,Uh... Pinkie Pie?
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,"Another slice of cake, Sir Lintsalot?"
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,Aaallrighty. What do you say we get on out of Creepytown and head over to Applejack's...
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,I most certainly am not. I'm having a wonderful time right here.
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,You should really just come with me.
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,"Who you calling a chump, chump?! Ugh... That's it. Party's over. Come on, Pinkie Pie!"
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,No!
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,"Pinkie Pie, let's go!"
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,I said no!
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,You... [grunts] have to... come with... me!

Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,"Oh, you wanna do this the hard way?! We'll do this the hard way!"
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,[grunting] [panting] We're... here...
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,I really thought she'd be more excited.
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,Excited? Excited?! Why would I be excited to attend my own farewell party?!
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Farewell party?
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,"Yes! You don't like me anymore, so you decided to kick me out of the group and throw a great, big party to celebrate! A ""Farewell to Pinkie Pie"" party!"
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,applejack,"Why in the world would you think we didn't like you anymore, sugarcube?"
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,"Why? Why? Why?! Because you've been lying to me and avoiding me all day, that's why!"
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,"Uh, yeah! Because we wanted your party to be a surprise."
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"We'd been planning this party for such a long time, we had to make excuses for why we couldn't attend Gummy's party so that we could get everything ready for yours."
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"If this is a farewell party, why does the cake I picked up from Sugarcube Corner say ""Happy Birthday, Pinkie Pie""?"
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,"[squeak] Because it's my birthday! Ooh, how could I have forgotten my own birthday?"
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,And you like me so much you decided to throw me a surprise party!
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"That's what we've been trying to tell you, darling."
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,You girls are the best friends ever! How could I have ever doubted you?
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"It's okay, Pinkie Pie. It could have happened to any of us."
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,Uh-huh! It sure would.
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,Don't worry about it.
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,I'm just glad I haven't been replaced by a bucket of turnips.
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Huh?
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,You don't wanna know.
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,applejack,"All right, girls! Enough of this gab. Let's party!"
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"Dear Princess Celestia,"
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"I am writing to you from the most delightful party. I'm not only having a great time with my friends, but also was given the opportunity to learn a valuable lesson about friendship. Always expect the best from your friends, and never assume the worst. Rest assured that a good friend always has your best interests at heart."
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,"You girls wouldn't mind if we celebrated Gummy's after-birthday party too, would you? His party was cut short, and he's pretty upset about it."
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,"Oh, definitely."
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"Aww, he was upset?"
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,applejack,"Uh-huh, sure!"
Party of One,Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,"For Gummy, yeah!"
The Best Night Ever,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,Ahh! I... can't... believe... the Grand... Galloping... Gala... is... tonight!

The Best Night Ever,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,"[moan] I'm sorry, Spike. Some of us do have standards."
The Best Night Ever,Amy Keating Rogers,spike,"I still can't believe we're gonna be at Canterlot tonight. Our hometown, Twilight! And the best part is that we all get to hang out together all night long!"

The Best Night Ever,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"Pardon me, Princess, but tonight was just awful."
The Best Night Ever,Amy Keating Rogers,princess celestia,"Oh, Twilight. The Grand Galloping Gala is always awful."
The Best Night Ever,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,It is?
The Best Night Ever,Amy Keating Rogers,princess celestia,"That is why I was thrilled you were all attending. I was hoping you could liven things up a bit. And while the evening may not have gone as you planned, I'm sure you'll agree that in the end it didn't turn out so bad for this group of friends."

The Best Night Ever,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,As horrible as our night was...
The Best Night Ever,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,...being together here has made it all better.
The Best Night Ever,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"In fact, it's made it..."
The Return of Harmony Part 1,M. A. Larson,cheerilee,"I want to start our field trip here, in the world-famous Canterlot sculpture garden. That one over there represents ""Friendship"". All right, my little ponies, this one represents ""Victory""."
The Return of Harmony Part 1,M. A. Larson,scootaloo,How cool would it be to have that for a cutie mark?
The Return of Harmony Part 1,M. A. Larson,apple bloom,"Cool, if you were actually victoryful at somethin'."
The Return of Harmony Part 1,M. A. Larson,sweetie belle,That's not a word!
The Return of Harmony Part 1,M. A. Larson,scootaloo,"What are you, a dictionary?"
The Return of Harmony Part 1,M. A. Larson,cheerilee,Girls! Now this is a really interesting statue. What do you notice about it?
The Return of Harmony Part 1,M. A. Larson,apple bloom,It's got an eagle claw!
The Return of Harmony Part 1,M. A. Larson,scootaloo,And a lion paw!
The Return of Harmony Part 1,M. A. Larson,sweetie belle,And a snake tail!
The Return of Harmony Part 1,M. A. Larson,cheerilee,This creature is called a draconequus. He has the head of a pony and a body made up of all sorts of things. What do you suppose that represents?
The Return of Harmony Part 1,M. A. Larson,apple bloom,Confusion!
The Return of Harmony Part 1,M. A. Larson,sweetie belle,Evil!
The Return of Harmony Part 1,M. A. Larson,scootaloo,Chaos!
The Return of Harmony Part 1,M. A. Larson,sweetie belle,"It's not chaos, you dodo!"
The Return of Harmony Part 1,M. A. Larson,scootaloo,Don't call me things I don't know the meaning of! And it is too chaos!
The Return of Harmony Part 1,M. A. Larson,sweetie belle,Is not!
The Return of Harmony Part 1,M. A. Larson,apple bloom,You're both wrong!
The Return of Harmony Part 1,M. A. Larson,cheerilee,"Actually, in a way, you're all right. This statue represents ""Discord"", which means a lack of harmony between ponies. In fact, you three have demonstrated discord so well that you're each going to write me an essay explaining it."
The Return of Harmony Part 1,M. A. Larson,cheerilee,"Now let's go, and I don't want anymore fighting."
The Return of Harmony Part 1,M. A. Larson,apple bloom,It's confusion!
The Return of Harmony Part 1,M. A. Larson,sweetie belle,Evil!
The Return of Harmony Part 1,M. A. Larson,scootaloo,Chaos!
The Return of Harmony Part 1,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,"Come back here, you! Gotcha! Eww, what is this? Cotton candy?"
The Return of Harmony Part 1,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,Wait a second! It's not supposed to rain until tomorrow. You can't just<U+0096>
The Return of Harmony Part 1,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,You did.
The Return of Harmony Part 1,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,"Hey, I didn't tell you to go anywhere!"
The Return of Harmony Part 1,M. A. Larson,applejack,"Rainbow Dash, what's going on with this rain? I mean chocolate milk? I mean chocolate milk rain?!"
The Return of Harmony Part 1,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,There's crazy weather all over Equestria! Cloudsdale is getting soaked by a major cola storm right now! But don't worry. I'm not leaving you until I get control of Ponyville!
The Return of Harmony Part 1,M. A. Larson,rarity,"Ahem. I heard about your troubles, Applejack, and I came to see if there's anything I can do without getting wet. Or dirty. Or out from under my umbrella."
The Return of Harmony Part 1,M. A. Larson,applejack,Fluttershy! Do somethin'!
The Return of Harmony Part 1,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,"Now, Angel, you really shouldn't<U+0096> No! It's not possible! I must be seeing things!"
The Return of Harmony Part 1,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Don't worry, everyone. I've learned a new spell that'll fix everything. My fail-safe spell... failed. What do we do?"
The Return of Harmony Part 1,M. A. Larson,spike,"Uh, give up?"
The Return of Harmony Part 1,M. A. Larson,rarity,"Spike, Twilight will come up with something."
The Return of Harmony Part 1,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Hmm, time for plan B. Rainbow, can you corral all those clouds in one corner of the sky? Applejack, I need you to bring those high-strung storm clouds down to Earth."
The Return of Harmony Part 1,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,"Hey, what happened?"
The Return of Harmony Part 1,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,Oh dear. I hope none of the animals see these delicious chocolate-filled cotton candy clouds. I'd hate to have to share them.
The Return of Harmony Part 1,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,"You and me both, sister! Hey!"
The Return of Harmony Part 1,M. A. Larson,applejack,"And when y'all are done with that, feel free to have some popcorn for dessert."
The Return of Harmony Part 1,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"You see, Spike? You should never give up. There's nothing we can't overcome if we all work together."
The Return of Harmony Part 1,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"[gasp] Come on, girls. Princess Celestia wants to see us all in Canterlot immediately!"
The Return of Harmony Part 1,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Princess Celestia, we came as fast as we could!"
The Return of Harmony Part 1,M. A. Larson,princess celestia,"Thank you, Twilight. Thank you, all."
The Return of Harmony Part 1,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,Is this about the weather? And the animals' weird behavior? What's happening out there? Why isn't my magic working? Is there<U+0096>
The Return of Harmony Part 1,M. A. Larson,princess celestia,Follow me.
The Return of Harmony Part 1,M. A. Larson,princess celestia,"I've called you here for a matter of great importance. It seems an old foe of mine, someone I thought I had defeated long ago, has returned. His name... is Discord."
The Return of Harmony Part 1,M. A. Larson,princess celestia,"Discord is the mischievous spirit of disharmony. Before my sister and I stood up to him, he ruled Equestria in an eternal state of unrest and unhappiness. Luna and I saw how miserable life was for Earth ponies, Pegasi, and unicorns alike, so after discovering the Elements of Harmony, we combined our powers and rose up against him, turning him to stone."
The Return of Harmony Part 1,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,"All right, Princess!"
The Return of Harmony Part 1,M. A. Larson,princess celestia,"I thought the spell we cast would keep him contained forever, but since Luna and I are no longer connected to the Elements, the spell has been broken."
The Return of Harmony Part 1,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,No longer connected?
The Return of Harmony Part 1,M. A. Larson,princess celestia,"This is Canterlot Tower, where the Elements are kept inside since all of you recovered them. I need you to wield the Elements of Harmony once again and stop Discord before he thrusts all of Equestria into eternal chaos."
The Return of Harmony Part 1,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,But why us? Why don't you<U+0096>
The Return of Harmony Part 1,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,"Hey, look! We're famous!"
The Return of Harmony Part 1,M. A. Larson,princess celestia,"You six showed the full potential of the Elements by harnessing the magic of your friendship to beat a mighty foe. Although Luna and I once wielded the Elements, it is you who now control their power, and it is you who must defeat Discord!"
The Return of Harmony Part 1,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Princess Celestia, you can count on<U+0096>"
The Return of Harmony Part 1,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,"Hold on a second! Eternal chaos comes with chocolate rain, you guys. Chocolate rain!"
The Return of Harmony Part 1,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Don't listen to her, Princess. We'd be honored to use the Elements of Harmony again."
The Return of Harmony Part 1,M. A. Larson,rarity,Ooh. You can keep the Elements. I'll take that case!
The Return of Harmony Part 1,M. A. Larson,princess celestia,"Have no fear, ponies. I have total confidence that you will be able to defeat Discord with these!"
The Return of Harmony Part 1,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,"Oh, well. If anyone needs me, I'll be outside in the chocolate puddles with a giant swizzle straw."
The Return of Harmony Part 1,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,The Elements! They're gone!
The Return of Harmony Part 1,M. A. Larson,princess celestia,That chamber is protected by a powerful spell that only I can break! This doesn't make sense!
The Return of Harmony Part 1,M. A. Larson,discord,"[laughter] Make sense? Oh, what fun is there in making sense?"
The Return of Harmony Part 1,M. A. Larson,princess celestia,Discord... Show yourself!
The Return of Harmony Part 1,M. A. Larson,discord,"[chuckling] Did you miss me, Celestia? I missed you. It's quite lonely being encased in stone, but you wouldn't know that, would you, because I don't turn ponies into stone."
The Return of Harmony Part 1,M. A. Larson,princess celestia,Enough! What have you done with the Elements of Harmony?
The Return of Harmony Part 1,M. A. Larson,princess celestia,"You'll never get away with this, Discord!"
The Return of Harmony Part 1,M. A. Larson,discord,"Oh, I'd forgotten how grim you can be, Celestia. It's really quite boring."
The Return of Harmony Part 1,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,Hey! Nopony insults the Princess!
The Return of Harmony Part 1,M. A. Larson,discord,"Oh, you must be Rainbow Dash, famed for her loyalty, the Element of Harmony you represent."
The Return of Harmony Part 1,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,That's right! I'll always be loyal to the Princess!
The Return of Harmony Part 1,M. A. Larson,discord,We'll see about that.
The Return of Harmony Part 1,M. A. Larson,rarity,I can't believe we're wasting our time talking to a tacky window.
The Return of Harmony Part 1,M. A. Larson,discord,"The beautiful Rarity, representing the element of generosity, if I'm not mistaken?"
The Return of Harmony Part 1,M. A. Larson,applejack,"So you know who we are, big deal."
The Return of Harmony Part 1,M. A. Larson,discord,"Oh, I know much more than that, honest Applejack."
The Return of Harmony Part 1,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,You seem to know our strengths too.
The Return of Harmony Part 1,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,Pinkie!
The Return of Harmony Part 1,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,[laughing] He's standing on your head!
The Return of Harmony Part 1,M. A. Larson,princess celestia,"Stop stalling, Discord! What have you done with the Elements of Harmony?"
The Return of Harmony Part 1,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,Can we go home now?
The Return of Harmony Part 1,M. A. Larson,applejack,What do you reckon he meant? Twists and turns and ending back where we started?
The Return of Harmony Part 1,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,Twists and turns... twists and turns... twists and turns! That's it! I bet Discord hid the Elements in the palace labyrinth!
The Return of Harmony Part 1,M. A. Larson,princess celestia,"Good luck, my little ponies. The fate of Equestria is in your hooves."
The Return of Harmony Part 1,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Thanks, Princess. We won't let you down."
The Return of Harmony Part 1,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,W-We have to go in there?
The Return of Harmony Part 1,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,Nope! Dopey Discord forgot about these babies! I'll just do a quick flyover and we'll have the Elements in no time. My wings!
The Return of Harmony Part 1,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,Give us our wings and horns back!
The Return of Harmony Part 1,M. A. Larson,discord,"You'll get them back in good time. I simply took them to ensure there's no cheating. You see, this is the first rule of our game: no flying, and no magic."
The Return of Harmony Part 1,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,The first rule?
The Return of Harmony Part 1,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Never fear, girls. We have each other!"
The Return of Harmony Part 1,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,"Yeah! Like Twilight said, there's nothing we can't overcome if we all stick together!"
The Return of Harmony Part 1,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"All right, girls, let's do this!"
The Return of Harmony Part 1,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Stay calm, girls! Everypony head to the middle as fast as you can, and we'll regroup there!"
The Return of Harmony Part 1,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,Moving out!
The Return of Harmony Part 1,M. A. Larson,rarity,See you in the center.
The Return of Harmony Part 1,M. A. Larson,applejack,Yee-haw!
The Return of Harmony Part 1,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,See you guys there!
The Return of Harmony Part 1,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,[gasping] What's that? Who's there? Girls!
The Return of Harmony Part 1,M. A. Larson,applejack,What in tarnation? Where am I?
The Return of Harmony Part 1,M. A. Larson,applejack,Who are y'all?
The Return of Harmony Part 1,M. A. Larson,applejack,"All right then. I don't trust this place worth a hill of beans, but I've got a really bad feelin' about this feller Discord. What's gonna come of this mission we're on?"
The Return of Harmony Part 1,M. A. Larson,applejack,No! Our friendship? Over?!
The Return of Harmony Part 1,M. A. Larson,applejack,It can't be true. It just can't!
The Return of Harmony Part 1,M. A. Larson,applejack,That just can't be the truth.
The Return of Harmony Part 1,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,Applejack! Thank goodness! I thought I heard voices over here. Who were you talking to?
The Return of Harmony Part 1,M. A. Larson,applejack,I was talking to... uh... nopony! Nopony whatsoever!
The Return of Harmony Part 1,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,What?
The Return of Harmony Part 1,M. A. Larson,applejack,"Nothing. Come on, uh, we best be going."
The Return of Harmony Part 1,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Did Applejack just...? Come on, Twilight! Applejack wouldn't lie."
The Return of Harmony Part 1,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,"Hey, what gives?"
The Return of Harmony Part 1,M. A. Larson,discord,"What's the matter, Pinkie Pie? I thought you appreciated a good laugh?"
The Return of Harmony Part 1,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,It's different. They're laughing at me.
The Return of Harmony Part 1,M. A. Larson,discord,It's hardly different. Your friends laugh at you all the time.
The Return of Harmony Part 1,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,"My friends laugh with me, not at me."
The Return of Harmony Part 1,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,No! Stop it!
The Return of Harmony Part 1,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,Stop laughing at me!
The Return of Harmony Part 1,M. A. Larson,discord,"Oh, poor Pinkie Pie. And here I thought laughter made you happy."
The Return of Harmony Part 1,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,[gravelly] Happy? I don't think so.
The Return of Harmony Part 1,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,Pinkie Pie! Are we glad to see you!
The Return of Harmony Part 1,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,"Oh you are, huh? Why? Need a good laugh?"
The Return of Harmony Part 1,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,Pinkie? What do you suppose has her so upset? It's not like her.
The Return of Harmony Part 1,M. A. Larson,applejack,I didn't notice anything strange about Pinkie.
The Return of Harmony Part 1,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,Weird. Better pick up the pace before the stress of this gets the better of all of us.
The Return of Harmony Part 1,M. A. Larson,rarity,"I was expecting an audience with the Princess, not outdoor sport. Agh. Oh my..."
The Return of Harmony Part 1,M. A. Larson,discord,"[laughing] Welcome to your lucky day, Rarity. You've found the one thing in Equestria that could rival my face for sheer beauty. What do you think? You like?"
The Return of Harmony Part 1,M. A. Larson,rarity,"Yes... I like very much... No! No, I shan't succumb to such fabulousness. Must... get to the center... to meet... the others. [grunt] Mine!"
The Return of Harmony Part 1,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,Rarity! Are we glad to see... Why are you carrying a humongous boulder?
The Return of Harmony Part 1,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,"[teeth chatter] Okay, I can do this. I can... [scream] Oh, wait a minute... Butterflies? Wait! Don't leave me here!"
The Return of Harmony Part 1,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,"Oh, no. I'm certain they're doing their best to find me."
The Return of Harmony Part 1,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,Not at all. I am weak and helpless and I appreciate their understanding.
The Return of Harmony Part 1,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,"Not really. In fact, I think I'm awfully lucky to have friends who want me to be the best I can be."
The Return of Harmony Part 1,M. A. Larson,discord,"Oh, for goodness sake! You've been kind for far too long, my dear. Time to be cruel. Arrivederci!"
The Return of Harmony Part 1,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,Fluttershy! I'm so glad to see a friendly face. This awful labyrinth is getting to everypony.
The Return of Harmony Part 1,M. A. Larson,applejack,Grrr...
The Return of Harmony Part 1,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,"Aw, boo-hoo-hoo! Why don't you wave your magic little horn and make everything all right?"
The Return of Harmony Part 1,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,Uh...
The Return of Harmony Part 1,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,"Oh, that's right, you can't. You don't have one."
The Return of Harmony Part 1,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,What is happening to my friends?
The Return of Harmony Part 1,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,And what are you laughing at?
The Return of Harmony Part 1,M. A. Larson,applejack,Chocolate milk.
The Return of Harmony Part 1,M. A. Larson,rarity,"Little help here! Thanks, Twilight."
The Return of Harmony Part 1,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,You're welcome<U+0096>
The Return of Harmony Part 1,M. A. Larson,rarity,But don't get any ideas about my gem! I know where you live.
The Return of Harmony Part 1,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,"I've got you now, element."
The Return of Harmony Part 1,M. A. Larson,discord,Oh. I can see why you like these clouds so much. Very plush.
The Return of Harmony Part 1,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,Get off there and put 'em up! Come on! Let's go!
The Return of Harmony Part 1,M. A. Larson,discord,"Hey, I'm here to deliver a message."
The Return of Harmony Part 1,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,I've got a message for you too!
The Return of Harmony Part 1,M. A. Larson,discord,"Listen closely, this is important. A weighty choice is yours to make:<U+00A0>the right selection or a big mistake. If a wrong choice you choose to pursue, the foundations of home will crumble without you."
The Return of Harmony Part 1,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,Cloudsdale? Crumble... without me? No!
The Return of Harmony Part 1,M. A. Larson,discord,"That box contains your wings. You can take them and leave the game, or you can carry on aimlessly wandering this maze. Your choice."
The Return of Harmony Part 1,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,Must... find... Rainbow Dash. As a team... we're unstoppable. Rainbow Dash won't let us down.
The Return of Harmony Part 1,M. A. Larson,applejack,"Well, looky there. Rainbow Dash is flying away. She's abandonin' us."
The Return of Harmony Part 1,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,Now I know that's a lie. [gasp] How can it be?
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Princess Celestia, we came as fast as we could."
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,princess celestia,I need you to wield the Elements of Harmony once again and stop Discord.
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,The Elements! They're gone!
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,discord,"[laughter] Everypony has to play, or the game is over and I win."
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,applejack,Our friendship...over?
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,Who are you talking to?
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,applejack,Nopony! Nopony whatsoever.
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,What?
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,Pinkie Pie! Are we glad to see you!
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,Why? Need a good laugh?
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,What is happening to my friends?
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,And what are you laughing at!?
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,discord,"Oh, you ponies are just the most fun I've had in aeons."
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,"Well, quit it! You'd better think before you laugh at the Pink...ie Pie!"
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,"Oh, yeah? Well ha, ha."
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,Quit it!
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,"No. Ha, ha."
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,Quit it!
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,No. Ha ha-ha ha ha.
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,applejack,"Uh... Rarity? This here diamond of yours? Twilight said we should split it six ways since we, uh, found it together."
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,rarity,"HI-YAH! Try it, punk. He's mine. All mine! Ya! Ya! Ya!"
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Girls, why are you all acting like this?"
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,Quit it! Stop it!
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,We need to stick together.
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,"Ha, ha."
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,discord,[laughter] It's just too entertaining.
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Stop it, Discord. You're not playing fair."
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,discord,"I'm not playing fair? Perhaps we haven't met. I'm Discord, spirit of chaos and disharmony. Hello?"
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,How are we supposed to find the Elements of Harmony when you took away the labyrinth before we could get to the end?
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,discord,"Oh, wait, did you...? [laughter] How funny! You thought the Elements were in the labyrinth?"
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,discord,I never said they were in the labyrinth.
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,But...but...
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,discord,"Keep trying, Twilight Sparkle. [mockingly] Maybe the magic of friendship can help you. Now if you'll excuse me, I have some chaos to wreak."
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,Chocolate milk? I hate chocolate milk!
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"[grunt] Think, Twilight, think! ""Find the Elements back where you began."" Back where you began."
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,rarity,Don't touch my gem!
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,"I'm touching your gem, Rarity. Ha, ha."
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,What 'chu laughin' at?
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Ugh. I just want to go home... Wait a minute... Home! ""Back where you began!"" The Elements must be in... Ponyville! Come on, girls. I'm certain this is what Discord's riddle really meant. If we get back to the library, I have a book that I just know can give us a clue. Ah!"
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,"Good boy, Angel. Mama's so proud."
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,applejack,"Wow, I can see so much better now. Whoa! I meant to do that."
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,Wah! Ahh! Whoa! Discord's turned our dirt roads into soap!
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,discord,"Beautiful, isn't it? This is the new and improved Ponyville, and these are only my first of changes."
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,"This may look like fun, but it's not."
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,Ugh.
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,discord,Picture it. The chaos capital of the world.
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,discord,"Well, wait a few minutes and you'll see it in the beautiful light of day. Or not."
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Ponyville, the chaos capital of the world? Not if I have anything to say about it."
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"[sigh] Okay, we're here. Everyone please, please, please just go inside, please?"
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,applejack,I absolutely refuse.
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,With pleasure.
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,I hate libraries!
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Pleeeease, we gotta hurry!"
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,rarity,"Forget it, Twilight. I know what you're up to. The second I go in, you'll have your little minion Spike come and take Tom!"
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,Tom?
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,rarity,"Well, it's not going to work."
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"You're not going in without him, are you?"
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,rarity,Mm-mm.
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,[grunting] Fine!
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,spike,"Ah! Brrr! What did you do that for, Fluttershy?"
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,'Cause you just looked so peaceful.
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,spike,I...uh...huh?
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,rarity,"Careful, Twilight! You'll ruin his beautiful finish."
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Oh, for the love of..."
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,spike,"Twilight, what's going on? Why does everybody look so...gray?"
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,Don't ask. I need you to help me find something.
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,"Hey, Twilight, what's soaking wet and clueless?"
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,spike,What's happened to everypony?
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,applejack,"I guess you just bring out the worst in us, Spike."
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,Ugh. No time to explain. We've got to find the reference guide to the Elements of Harmony before somepony does something she'll regret!
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,spike,"The Elements of Harmony? Oh, I know exactly where that book is. Found it!"
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,Hah!
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Fluttershy, you'd better give me that book!"
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,[sing-song voice] Keep away!
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Hey! Applejack, give me that book!"
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,applejack,I don't have any book.
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,Pinkie! You guys! Stop it right now!
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,spike,Ugh!
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,rarity,Mine!
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Hey, do you even know what you just stole?"
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,rarity,"No, but if you want it, I want it!"
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,[strained groan] GIVE ME THAT BOOK!
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,Where is she? Where's Rarity?
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,applejack,Beats me.
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,Lies!
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Get back! All of you! This is my book, and I'm going to READ IT! [gasp] The Elements!"
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,The Elements! They were here all along!
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,spike,This is great! Now you guys can defeat Discord and put everything back to normal!
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"See, girls? We did it! We found the Elements of Harmony! Together!"
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"You don't even care, do you?"
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"[sigh] I never thought it would happen. My friends... have turned into complete JERKS! Necklace! Necklace! Necklace! Necklace! And... big crown thingy! Come on, everypony, let's go!"
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,spike,"But Twilight, aren't you missing somepony?"
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Nope. We've got the liar, the grump, the hoarder, and the brute. That just about covers it."
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,spike,But what about Rainbow Dash?
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Congratulations, Spike, you're the new Rainbow Dash. Now let's go!"
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,spike,[gasp] Me? B-b-but what if she finds out I've been impersonating her? [moan] That won't end well.
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Too bad, you're Rainbow Dash. Now let's go defeat Discord so we don't ever have to talk to each other again!"
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Move! Look out, here comes Tom!"
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,discord,"Well, well, well, I see you've found the Elements of Harmony. How terrifying!"
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,Discord! I've figured out your lame riddle. You're in for it now!
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,discord,"I certainly am. You've clearly out-dueled me, and now it's time to meet my fate. I'm prepared to be defeated now, ladies. Fire when ready."
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Formation, now!"
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"""Rainbow Dash"", get over here."
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"All right, let's get this over with. What's going on?"
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,applejack,Mine's workin'. There must be somethin' wrong with yours.
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,I HATE the Elements of Harmony!
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,Hmph! Garbage.
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,rarity,MINE!
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,spike,"Sorry, Twilight. I guess I'd better get back upstairs and clean up the library. Good luck with all this<U+0096> whoa!"
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,It's your fault it didn't work.
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,Who are you talking to?
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,Any of you! ALL OF YOU! I'm outta here!
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,applejack,"I better go, too. I've got new better friends waiting for me at the farm."
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,Yeah! I'm sick of you losers.
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"FINE! Leave! See if I care! I don't need you guys either! With friends like you, who needs...enemies...?"
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,discord,"[laughing] Oh, my stomach! Twilight, you've got to see what I just did."
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,discord,"It's priceless! [laughing] Come now, Twilight Sparkle. You've got to get into the spirit of things! After all, this is your new home."
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,Not anymore...
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Pack your things, Spike, we're leaving."
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Don't ask where we're going, 'cause I don't know yet. Just not here."
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,spike,Can't...move. The princess...has been sending these...since I came back upstairs. [belch] Make it stop!
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,These are all the letters I've written to the princess since I've lived in Ponyville. But why would she send them back?
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"""Real friends don't care what your cover is."""
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"You're right, Spike. I've got to fight for my friendships. For them. For me. For Equestria!"
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,Oh...uh...why don't you just stay here and rest? I'll take care of the whole fighting for friendship thing myself.
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,applejack,"And so I tried to defeat Discord, but none of my so-called ""friends"" would lift a hoof to help me."
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Applejack, I'm here to fight for our friendship."
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,applejack,"Oh, now you want to fight. Where you went when I was battlin' Discord?"
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,Snap out of it. This isn't you! You're not a liar.
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,applejack,"Wh-what happened? Twilight! [sigh] I saw a vision of us feudin' and fightin'. I couldn't face the truth, so I started tellin' lies. Can you ever forgive me?"
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,I already have. Come on!
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,"Oh no! Twilight, Applejack, I just had the worst dream!"
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,rarity,What do you think you're doing? Get away from my gem! Get away--! [grunting] Let us never speak of this again.
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,[laughter] And I-I turned gray! [giggle] Can you believe it?!
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,Uh? She's not here.
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Without Rainbow Dash, we can't use the Elements."
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,applejack,She could be anywhere by now! We're never gonna find her.
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,"Yeah, we will, 'cause she's right there!"
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,Rainbow Dash!
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,"Hey, guys!"
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,We've been looking everywhere for you!
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,That's nice.
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Discord's still on the loose! We need you to help us defeat him with your element, Loyalty!"
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,"Pfft. Loyalty, schmoyalty! Have you guys seen Ponyville? It's a disaster! I'm staying here in Cloudsdale where everything's awesome."
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,rarity,How in Equestria can she think that tiny patch of clouds is Cloudsdale?
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,applejack,The same way he got you to think that cheap rock was a bona fide diamond.
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,rarity,I thought we agreed never to speak of that again.
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,Time for Plan B.
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"[whispering] Okay, Fluttershy, you grab Rainbow Dash and hold her down. Applejack will lower me down from this rope so I can cast the memory spell on her."
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,Got it!
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,Um...I'm just wondering if it's okay if I hold you down against your will for a little bit?
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,Ugh...
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,"Nice try! Ponyville's your problem, not mine."
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Come on, Fluttershy, we've got to catch her. Hyah! Applejack!"
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,rarity,PINKIE! You were supposed to secure the ROPE!
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,Oops.
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,applejack,"Rarity, Pinkie, hold on! Y'all are slowing her down!"
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,rarity,"Oh, Fluttershy, would you be a dear and FLY FASTER, please?"
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,[whimper/crying] I can't!
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"If you can't catch her, Discord wins!"
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,That big... dumb... MEANIE!
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Okay, Applejack, last rope! Make it count!"
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,Lemme go! I don't need you guys! Leave me alone! Wh-what happened? [gasp] How's Ponyville? Where are the Elements?! Did we stop Discord?
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,Maybe it's a little early for a group hug.
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,discord,"[laughter] Chaos is a wonderful, wonderful thing."
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,Not as wonderful as friendship.
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,discord,"Oh, this again?"
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,applejack,That's right. You couldn't break apart our friendship for long.
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"I'll tell you what we've learned, Discord: we've learned that friendship isn't always easy, but there's no doubt it's worth fighting for!"
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,discord,"Ugh, gag. Fine, go ahead. Try and use your little Elements. Friend me. Just make it quick. I'm missing some excellent chaos here."
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"All right, ladies, let's show him what friendship can do!"
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,discord,Huh. What's this? No. NO!!!
The Return of Harmony Part 2,M. A. Larson,princess celestia,We are gathered here today to once again honor the heroism of these six friends who stood up to the villain Discord and saved Equestria from eternal chaos.
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Quill.
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,spike,Check.
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Parchment.
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,spike,Check.
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Extra ink.
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,spike,Check.
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Extra extra ink.
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,spike,Check.
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Is that everything on the checklist?
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,spike,Yep.
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"Great. Now that we've completed the checklist of things we need to create a checklist, we can make my checklist of the things I have to get done by the end of the day. Ready?"
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,spike,Ready!
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Item one: create checklist of the things I have to accomplish by the end of the day.
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"How are we doing, Spike?"
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,spike,"Let's see... We've already dropped off your cape at the cleaners, returned the blackboard you borrowed from Cheerilee, ordered new parchment and quills from the stationery shop..."
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Hmm... Seems like we just placed an order for those a few days ago.
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,spike,Can't imagine why we go through so many of them.
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Sounds like we're ahead of schedule. What's next?
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,spike,Cupcakes!
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,spike,Whoa...
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"Uh, I only ordered twelve."
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,spike,Uhhh-no!
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"Oh, that was very thoughtful of you. It's just some of the icing from the extra cupcake is getting all over the one next to it. See?"
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,It's just that I'm planning on sharing these at a picnic later and I don't want anypony to feel like somepony else is getting more icing.
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"Not to worry, I'll just move some of this one to... hmm... I think I may have scooped too much... oops! Now those two have more. Let's just try this again... Hmm, no, that won't do. Let me just... hmm... put some here, and... no, that's not right. A little more on this one, a little bit... and wait... I'll just... ooh, a little bit here, and here, and... perfect!"
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"Okay, time to tackle the next item on our-- oops! Looks like we're going to have to add 'give a baby dragon a bath' to our list."
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Very efficient! And a little bit gross.
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,spike,Eh.
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,spike,Looks like that's everything!
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Almost everything.
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,spike,"""Triple-check checklist to make sure we didn't miss anything when we double checked the checklist!"" Uh... check! Ugh... I've been holding that quill so long, I've got a claw cramp! Well, good thing we don't have anything to report to Princess Celestia this week... I don't think I could write another word!"
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,We haven't sent a letter to Princess Celestia this week?!
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,spike,Why? Is that bad?
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"Bad? BAD? Of course it's bad! I'm supposed to send Princess Celestia a letter every week, telling her about a lesson I've learned about friendship! Not every other week, not every ten days, every... single... week!"
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,spike,Huh?
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"Ohh... Where's my calendar, where's my calendar?!"
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,spike,Where it.. always is?
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,When did we send the last one?
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,spike,Last... Tuesday?
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,And today is...
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,spike,Tuesday?
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"Argh! Nononononononono! If I don't send her a letter by sundown, I'll be... tardy!"
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,spike,What's that now?
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"Tar-dy, Spike! Late, I'll be late! Oh, how could I let this happen? I'm usually so organized. I've never been late with an assignment."
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,spike,"Oh, please! You're the most studious student ever! I'm sure the Princess will forgive you if you miss one little deadline."
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"I'm afraid to take that chance, Spike. This is the ruler of all of Equestria we're talking about. The pony who holds my fate in her hooves! What if she doesn't forgive me?"
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,spike,Yeah... I don't think she--
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,What if instead she starts thinking I'm not taking my studies on friendship seriously?
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,spike,Why would she--
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,What if she makes me come back to Canterlot and puts me back in school and makes me prove I've been taking them seriously by giving me a test?! What if I don't pass?!
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,spike,"Well, why wouldn't you pass--"
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,She's my teacher. Do you know what teachers do to students who don't pass? They send them back a grade! But she won't just send me back a grade. She'll send me back to... magic kindergarten.
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,spike,Twilight? Twilight!
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Huh?
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,spike,That is the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard! You're not going to be sent back to magic kindergarten.
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,You're right. I have no reason to worry. Because I'm going to solve a friend's problem and get that letter to Princess Celestia before sundown!
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"So... got any problems, troubles, conundrums, or any other sort of issues, major or minor, that I as a good friend could help you solve?"
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,spike,Huh. Hmm. Huunh. Huh... I got nothin'.
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,[sigh] Then it looks like I'm going to have to find somepony who does.
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,spike,[sigh] This won't end well.
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"You've got this, Twilight. You still have plenty of time to get that letter to Princess Celestia! Has to be somepony who needs the help of a good friend!"
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Rarity!
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"Don't worry, Rarity! I'm here!"
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"[sobbing] Why me-e-e-e-e-ee... [gasp] WHYYYY?! Why? Why-y?! And of all the worst things that could happen, this is THE. WORST. POSSIBLE. THING!"
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,What's happened? Are you alright?
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"[gasp] I've lost my diamond-encrusted purple ribbon! I have searched high, and I have searched low. Low and high! High and low! But I can't find it anywhere! Anywhe-e-e-e-ere! How can I possibly finish my latest creation if I can't find it?!"
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"Never fear, Rarity. As your friend I'll do my best to help you fi--"
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"Oh, there it is. Isn't it always just the last place you look?"
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,So... you just lost your ribbon?
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,Mm-hm!
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,But now you've found it?
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,Yuh-huh.
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"And nothing else is bothering you? Nothing that I, as a good friend, could help you with?"
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,Hmm... there is one thing.
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Yes?
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,I think I left my measuring tape under the fabric over there. Could you get that for me?
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,[sighs] Measuring tape? Sure.
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,Twilight? Is there something bother-- Twilight?
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,No need to panic. Rarity is just one pony. I'm sure one of my other friends will need me.
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"What in the world...? Rainbow must be angry with Applejack! She must hate her guts! How wonderful! Rainbow Dash! Stop! Listen, Rainbow. I know you're upset with Applejack, but don't worry. Whatever it is that has come between you two, I'm sure that I, as a good friend, can help you resolve your problems."
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,"Uh, what are you talking about?"
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"Oh, Rainbow Dash, you don't have to hide your feelings from me! I can tell you two must've had a terrible fight."
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"Now, why don't you tell me all about your issues with Applejack."
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,I don't have any issues with Applejack.
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,You don't? Then why are you destroying her property?
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,"Because she asked me to. Right, Applejack?"
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,applejack,"Yes, ma'am. I wanted to put up a new barn, but this one's gotta come down first. Hehe. Now get back to it, R.D."
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,"You got it, boss!"
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,applejack,I'd take cover if I were you.
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"[sigh] I can't believe I wasted all that time. I should have just come here first. Fluttershy always has some fear she's trying to get over. As a good friend, I'll be able to help her."
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Fluttershy?
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"How can this be happening? Of all the days she had to stop being such a scaredy-pony, she had to pick today?! What am I going to do?!"
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,You really should have come to me sooner. You were carrying so much tension in that shoulder.
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,It's fine. It'll all be fine. The day isn't over yet. But it will be over soon!
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,[groans] It'll be all over! My time in Ponyville! My advanced studies! Nono. You're a good student. You can do this. Ooh! But what if I can't? You can! You just have to keep it together. Keep. It. Together!
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,spike,Are you talking to... yourself? Twilight?
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,spike,Snap out of it!
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Huh?
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,spike,Are you okay?
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,spike,"Twilight, I'm really worried. I mean this letter thing is really getting to you. Here. You've been so anxious all day that you completely forgot about the picnic. Why don't you just relax and go hang out with--"
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,The picnic! I should go see my friends!
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,spike,I'm glad you've come to your senses.
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"Please tell me I did not forget the plates. [gasp] I did. I totally forgot them. Of all the worst things that could happen, this is THE. WORST. POSSIBLE. THING! [cries] Why, why, why... Uh... What? You didn't expect me to lay on the grass, did you?"
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,applejack,"You alright, hun?"
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,No! I am not alright.
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,It's just terrible.
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Simply awful.
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,It's the most horrific trouble I've ever been in and I really really really need your help!
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"My letter to Princess Celestia is almost overdue, and I haven't learned anything about friendship!"
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,"Oh, thank goodness. I thought something really awful had happened."
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"[strangled noises] Something awful has happened! If I don't turn in the letter on time, I'll be tardy! TARDY!"
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,applejack,"No offense, sugarcube, but it looks like somepony's gettin' themselves all worked up over nothin'."
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,This is not nothing. This is everything. I need you guys to help me find somepony with a problem I can fix before sundown! My whole life depends on it!
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,applejack,Come on now. Have a seat and stop sweatin' the small stuff.
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,Wow. I've never seen Twilight so upset before.
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"Oh, what a drama queen. Mm. Relatively speaking..."
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"Clock is ticking, Twilight. Clock. Is. Ticking. Keep it together. If I can't find a friendship problem... I'll make a friendship problem!"
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,"Oh, hi, Twilight. How's it go--"
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"Gr-eat. Just great. You three look like you're doing great too! Looks like three good friends who obviously don't need the help of another good friend. This is Smarty Pants. She was mine when I was your age, and now I want to give her to you!"
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,scootaloo,Uhh... she's... great.
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,Yeah. Great.
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,sweetie belle,I really... like her... mane.
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"She even comes with her own notebook and quill, for when you want to pretend she's doing her homework!"
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,scootaloo,That's... um... great.
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,Yeah... great.
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,sweetie belle,I really like her... mane?
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"I just hope the fact that there are three of you and only one of her doesn't become a problem! I'd hate to cause a rift between such good friends. So, who wants to play with her first?"
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,"Uh... You should play with her first, Sweetie Belle. Y'know, 'cause you like her mane so much."
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,sweetie belle,Nonononononono. I think Scootaloo should get to play with her first.
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,scootaloo,"I'd love to, but, um, you take her, Apple Bloom."
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,Applejack says it's important to share.
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"[thinking] I gotta think of something! Thinkthinkthinkthinkthink Twilight, think! [gasp] That's it! [aloud] Ooh, you're going to like Smarty Pants. And you're going to like her more than anything."
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,scootaloo,[gasp] I want it.
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,I need it.
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,sweetie belle,I really like her mane!
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"The 'want it, need it' spell. Works every time. Okay, okay, let's break it up. I think we can all see that there is an important lesson to be learned here about-- Ugh! C'mon, girls, we're all friends here, right? Don't you think you ought to share?"
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,No way!
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,[annoyed groan] Big McIntosh! Thank goodness! You've gotta help me get that doll away from those girls!
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,big mcintosh,Eeyup.
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"Oh, thank you so much. Now if you could just give her to me?"
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,big mcintosh,Nnnope.
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Oh no!
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,Give her back!
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,mayor mare,What's all the commotion about?
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,sweetie drops,"That incredible, amazing doll!"
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,mayor mare,Gimme!
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,big mcintosh,Nope.
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"Oh, what have I done?!"
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,applejack,Y'all hear that? What in the name of all things oats 'n apples is goin' on here?!
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Don't look at it!
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,Don't look at what?
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,My Smarty Pants doll! I enchanted her and now everypony is fighting over her!
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,Why would you enchant your doll?
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"Oh, I had to do something! I had nothing to report to Princess Celestia! I thought if I couldn't find a problem, I'd make a problem! The day is almost over!"
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,applejack,Not almost!
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,princess celestia,Twilight Sparkle!
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,applejack,Whoa nelly.
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,princess celestia,Meet me in the library.
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"Goodbye, girls. If you care to visit, I'll be in magic kindergarten, back in Canterlot."
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,Magic kindergarten?
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,Canterlot?
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,We're never gonna see Twilight again!
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,applejack,"Uh, what are we gonna do, y'all?"
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"Of all the worst things that could happen, this is THE. WORST. POSSIBLE. THING! What? I really mean it this time!"
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,But...but... I'm supposed to send you a letter about friendship every week. I missed the deadline. I'm a bad student! I'm... tardy!
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,princess celestia,"You are a wonderful student, Twilight. I don't have to get a letter every week to know that."
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Really?
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,Wait!
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,You can't punish her!
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,applejack,It wasn't her fault!
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,princess celestia,I'm listening.
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,"Please, your Highness. We all saw that Twilight was upset."
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,But we thought that the thing she was worrying about wasn't worth worrying about.
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,applejack,"So when she ran off all worked up, not a single one of us tried to stop her."
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"As Twilight's good friends, we should have taken her feelings seriously and been there for her!"
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,Please don't take her away from us just because we were too insensitive to help her.
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,princess celestia,Looks like you all learned a pretty valuable lesson today.
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,princess celestia,"Very well. I'll forget Twilight's ""punishment"" on one condition."
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,princess celestia,"From this day forth, I would like you all to report to me your findings on the magic of friendship when, and only when, you happen to discover them."
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"Princess Celestia, wait! How did you know I was in trouble?"
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,princess celestia,"Your friend Spike made me aware that you were letting your fears get the best of you. I commend him for taking your feelings seriously. Now, if you will all excuse me, I must return to Canterlot. I'm expecting some mail."
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,applejack,"Y'all heard the Princess. Spike, take a letter."
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,applejack,"[clears throat] Dear Princess Celestia,"
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,applejack,We're writin' to you because today we all learned a little somethin' about friendship.
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,We learned that you should take your friends' worries seriously.
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,Even if you don't think that she has anything to worry about.
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,And that you shouldn't let your worries turn a small problem...
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,...into an enormously huge entire-town-in-total-chaos Princess-has-to-come-and-save-the-day problem.
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,applejack,"Signed, your loyal subjects."
Lesson Zero,Meghan McCarthy,spike,"P.S. Obviously Spike did not have to learn a lesson, because he is the best, most awesome friend a pony could ask for. Unlike everypony else, he took things seriously, and- Eheh... uh... yeah... I'll just, um..."
Luna Eclipsed,M. A. Larson,spike,"Ugh, come on, Twilight. We're gonna be late for the Nightmare Night festival. Huh? Are you that one kooky grandpa from Ponyville Retirement Village?"
Luna Eclipsed,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,I'm Star Swirl the Bearded! Father of the amniomorphic spell? Did you even read that book I gave you about obscure unicorn history?
Luna Eclipsed,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Hi, everypony. Great costumes. Happy Nightmare Night, Granny Smith."
Luna Eclipsed,M. A. Larson,granny smith,I should have been asleep five hours ago.
Luna Eclipsed,M. A. Larson,pipsqueak,"Pipsqueak the pirate, at your service. It's my very first Nightmare Night."
Luna Eclipsed,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,Since you moved here from Trottingham?
Luna Eclipsed,M. A. Larson,pipsqueak,"No, my very first Nightmare Night ever!"
Luna Eclipsed,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,[chicken squawk] Enough chitchat! Time is candy!
Luna Eclipsed,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Pinkie Pie, aren't you a little old for this?"
Luna Eclipsed,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,Too old for free candy? [chicken squawk] Never.
Luna Eclipsed,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,[bell jingles] Do you like it?
Luna Eclipsed,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,"Yeah! Great costume, Twilight! You make a fantastic weirdo clown!"
Luna Eclipsed,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,A clown? Look at the borders on these robes. These are hoof-stitched!
Luna Eclipsed,M. A. Larson,spike,It's a great costume! Huh! Grandpa!
Luna Eclipsed,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,Star Swirl the Bearded is only the most important conjurer of the pre-classical era.
Luna Eclipsed,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"He created more than two hundred spells! He even has a shelf in the Canterlot library of magic named after him. Maybe I should start up a pony group to teach ponies about history. I bet everypony would love it! Don't you, Spike?"
Luna Eclipsed,M. A. Larson,spike,[chewing candy] Mm-hmm! [eating sounds] I love it!
Luna Eclipsed,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Hey look, we're here already! Should we get something to eat?"
Luna Eclipsed,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,"Twilight, Twilight! Look at our haul! Ah! Can you believe it? And then, we went to Cheerilee's house, and got a bunch more goodies. Didn't we, Pip?"
Luna Eclipsed,M. A. Larson,pipsqueak,Sure did!
Luna Eclipsed,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,"And then, we had to stop and wait for Granny Smith, and -<U+0096>"
Luna Eclipsed,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Rainbow Dash, that wasn't very nice."
Luna Eclipsed,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,"Lighten up, old-timer. This is the best night of the year for pranks!"
Luna Eclipsed,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,Look what you did to Spike!
Luna Eclipsed,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,It's all in good fun. Oh! Oh! There's another group over there!
Luna Eclipsed,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Happy Nightmare Night, Applejack!"
Luna Eclipsed,M. A. Larson,applejack,"Howdy, Spike! Hey, Twilight! Nice costume."
Luna Eclipsed,M. A. Larson,spike,Thanks! I'm a dragon.
Luna Eclipsed,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"She means me, Spike."
Luna Eclipsed,M. A. Larson,applejack,"With that beard, I reckon you're some sorta country music singer."
Luna Eclipsed,M. A. Larson,applejack,"While y'all are here, ya' feel like bobbin' for an apple?"
Luna Eclipsed,M. A. Larson,mayor mare,"Thank you, everypony, and welcome to the Nightmare Night festival!"
Luna Eclipsed,M. A. Larson,spike,Spooky voice might work better if she wasn't dressed like that.
Luna Eclipsed,M. A. Larson,zecora,"Follow me, and very soon, you'll hear the tale of Nightmare Moon."
Luna Eclipsed,M. A. Larson,zecora,"Listen close, my little dears, I'll tell you where you got your fears of Nightmare Night, so dark and scary. [blows] Of Nightmare Moon, who makes you wary."
Luna Eclipsed,M. A. Larson,zecora,"Every year, we put on a disguise, to save ourselves from her searching eyes."
Luna Eclipsed,M. A. Larson,zecora,But Nightmare Moon wants just one thing: to gobble up ponies in one quick swing!
Luna Eclipsed,M. A. Larson,zecora,"Hungrily, she soars the sky. If she sees nopony, she passes by. So if she comes and all is clear, Equestria is safe another year!"
Luna Eclipsed,M. A. Larson,pipsqueak,"Uh, Miss Zecora, if we wear costumes to hide from Nightmare Moon, so she won't gobble us up, how come we still need to give her some of our candy?"
Luna Eclipsed,M. A. Larson,zecora,"A perfect question, my little friend. For Nightmare Moon you must not offend. [blows] Fill up her belly with a treat or two, so she won't return to come eat you!"
Luna Eclipsed,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,[screaming] Everypony! Just dump some candy and get out of here!
Luna Eclipsed,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,[gasp] It's Nightmare Moon! Run!
Luna Eclipsed,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,[awestruck] Princess Luna!
Luna Eclipsed,M. A. Larson,princess luna,"[booming voice] Citizens of Ponyville! We have graced your tiny village with our presence, so that you might behold the real Princess of the Night! A creature of nightmares no longer, but instead a pony who desires your love and admiration! Together we shall change this dreadful celebration into a bright and glorious feast!"
Luna Eclipsed,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,"Did you hear that, everypony? Nightmare Moon says she's gonna feast on us all!"
Luna Eclipsed,M. A. Larson,princess luna,"[normal voice] What? No, children, no! You no longer have reason to fear us! Screams of delight is what your princess desires, not screams of terror! [stomps hoof] Madame Mayor, thy Princess of the Night hath arrived."
Luna Eclipsed,M. A. Larson,princess luna,"What is the matter with you? Very well, then. Be that way. We won't even bother with the traditional royal farewell."
Luna Eclipsed,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,I'm gonna go talk to her.
Luna Eclipsed,M. A. Larson,spike,You can't talk to her! She's Nightmare Moon!
Luna Eclipsed,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"No, she's not. I saw the Elements of Harmony change her back to good. But it seems like she's having some trouble adjusting after being gone for a thousand years."
Luna Eclipsed,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Princess Luna? Hi, my name is-"
Luna Eclipsed,M. A. Larson,princess luna,Star Swirl the Bearded. Commendable costume! Thou even got the bells right.
Luna Eclipsed,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Thank you! Finally! Somepony who gets my costume! Uh, I just came to welcome you to our celebration! My actual name is-"
Luna Eclipsed,M. A. Larson,princess luna,Twilight Sparkle. [booming voice] It was thou who unleashed the powers of harmony upon us and took away our dark powers!
Luna Eclipsed,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"And that was a good thing, right?"
Luna Eclipsed,M. A. Larson,princess luna,[normal voice] But of course. We could not be happier. Is that not clear?
Luna Eclipsed,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Well, you kinda sound like you're yelling at me."
Luna Eclipsed,M. A. Larson,princess luna,"But this is the traditional royal Canterlot voice! It is tradition to speak using the royal ""we"", and to use [booming voice] this much volume when addressing our subjects!"
Luna Eclipsed,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"You know, that might explain why your appearance was met with... mixed results. I think if you just changed your approach a bit, you might be met with a warmer reception."
Luna Eclipsed,M. A. Larson,princess luna,[booming voice] Change our approach?
Luna Eclipsed,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,Lower the volume?
Luna Eclipsed,M. A. Larson,princess luna,[normal voice] Ohhh. We have been locked away for a thousand years. We are... not sure we can.
Luna Eclipsed,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,Go away! No candy here! Visitors not welcome on Nightmare Night!
Luna Eclipsed,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"[nervous laughing] Fluttershy, it's me, Twilight!"
Luna Eclipsed,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,[nervous laughter] Wait right here.
Luna Eclipsed,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,Fluttershy... you remember Princess Luna?
Luna Eclipsed,M. A. Larson,princess luna,[booming voice] Charmed.
Luna Eclipsed,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,[timidly] Likewise.
Luna Eclipsed,M. A. Larson,princess luna,[booming voice] Twilight Sparkle hath spoken of the sweetness of thy voice. We ask thou teachest to us to speak as thou speakest.
Luna Eclipsed,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,[very quiet] Okay.
Luna Eclipsed,M. A. Larson,princess luna,[booming voice] Shall our lessons begin?
Luna Eclipsed,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,[whisper] Okay.
Luna Eclipsed,M. A. Larson,princess luna,[booming voice] Shall we mimic thy voice?
Luna Eclipsed,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,[quiet] Okay.
Luna Eclipsed,M. A. Larson,princess luna,[booming voice] How is this?
Luna Eclipsed,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,"[hurriedly] Perfect, lesson over!"
Luna Eclipsed,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"A little quieter, princess."
Luna Eclipsed,M. A. Larson,princess luna,[booming voice] How is... [loud voice] this?
Luna Eclipsed,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Better. Right, Fluttershy?"
Luna Eclipsed,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,"[nervous, dazed laughter] Yes."
Luna Eclipsed,M. A. Larson,princess luna,[loud voice] How... about... now?
Luna Eclipsed,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,Now you're getting it.
Luna Eclipsed,M. A. Larson,princess luna,[normal voice] And... how about now?
Luna Eclipsed,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,Yes! Well done.
Luna Eclipsed,M. A. Larson,princess luna,"[booming voice] I thank thee, dear Fluttershy! Our normal speaking voice shall surely win us the hearts of thy fellow villagers."
Luna Eclipsed,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,Fluttershy! You've gotta hide us! Nightmare Moon is here and... [chicken squawk] Ah! She stole Fluttershy's voice so she can't scream when she gobbles her up!
Luna Eclipsed,M. A. Larson,princess luna,"[booming voice] Nay, children, wait! [normal voice] I mean... nay, children, no, wait."
Luna Eclipsed,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Come on, princess. Time for plan B."
Luna Eclipsed,M. A. Larson,princess luna,"It is of no use, Twilight Sparkle. They have never liked us and they never shall."
Luna Eclipsed,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,My friend Applejack is one of the most likable ponies around. I'm sure she'll have some ideas.
Luna Eclipsed,M. A. Larson,pipsqueak,Heee...!
Luna Eclipsed,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Uh... Applejack, the princess is looking for a little advice on how to fit in around here."
Luna Eclipsed,M. A. Larson,applejack,"""Fit in""? Really?"
Luna Eclipsed,M. A. Larson,applejack,"I mean... that's easy! All you gotta do is have the right attitude. Loosen up a bit, be positive, play a few games, have some fun."
Luna Eclipsed,M. A. Larson,princess luna,"Fun? What is this ""fun"" thou speakest of? Pray tell, what purpose do these serve?"
Luna Eclipsed,M. A. Larson,applejack,"You can do it, princess!"
Luna Eclipsed,M. A. Larson,princess luna,"Ha! Your princess enjoys this ""fun""! In what other ways may we experience it?"
Luna Eclipsed,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Fire away, princess!"
Luna Eclipsed,M. A. Larson,princess luna,Ha ha! The fun has been doubled!
Luna Eclipsed,M. A. Larson,applejack,"Why don't you try bobbin' for apples? We got the best apples in Equestria here, princess."
Luna Eclipsed,M. A. Larson,princess luna,"I ask that thou call us... me... Luna, fair Applejack. Hear me, villagers! All of you! Call me Luna!"
Luna Eclipsed,M. A. Larson,princess luna,Show me to these bobbing apples.
Luna Eclipsed,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,"Hey, gals. Anypony seen Pip? We lost him the last time we had to run<U+0096> [chicken squawk] Aaah! Nightmare Moon is gobbling Pipsqueak! Everypony run!"
Luna Eclipsed,M. A. Larson,pipsqueak,Help! My backside has been gobbled!
Luna Eclipsed,M. A. Larson,princess luna,"'Tis a lie! Thy backside is whole and ungobbled, thou ungrateful whelp! [hoof stomp, thunder] Fair villagers, please do not back away. Let us join together in... fun!"
Luna Eclipsed,M. A. Larson,princess luna,Not enough fun for you? What say you to this?!
Luna Eclipsed,M. A. Larson,princess luna,Huzzah! How many points do I receive?
Luna Eclipsed,M. A. Larson,princess luna,Do not run away!
Luna Eclipsed,M. A. Larson,princess luna,"As your princess, we command you!"
Luna Eclipsed,M. A. Larson,princess luna,[deafening voice] Be still!
Luna Eclipsed,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Princess, remember! Watch the screaming!"
Luna Eclipsed,M. A. Larson,princess luna,"[booming voice] No, Twilight Sparkle! We must use the traditional royal Canterlot voice for what we are about to say. Since you choose to fear your princess rather than love her, and dishonor her with this insulting celebration, we decree that Nightmare Night shall be canceled! Forever!"
Luna Eclipsed,M. A. Larson,applejack,"[sigh] Shoot. We had everything goin' our way. Luna was happy, everypony in town was happy, now look at 'em."
Luna Eclipsed,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,It's not over yet.
Luna Eclipsed,M. A. Larson,applejack,What are you gonna do?
Luna Eclipsed,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,I'm going to do what I do best. Lecture her!
Luna Eclipsed,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,Princess?
Luna Eclipsed,M. A. Larson,princess luna,"Leave me be, Twilight Sparkle."
Luna Eclipsed,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Princess, I'm sorry it hasn't worked out how we wanted. But you have to believe me when I tell you that Nightmare Night is one of the most popular celebrations we have."
Luna Eclipsed,M. A. Larson,princess luna,Yes. I can tell. By all the adoring shrieks of the children as they run away.
Luna Eclipsed,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,Princess...
Luna Eclipsed,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,No! No shrieking. No screaming or squealing either. Okay?
Luna Eclipsed,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,[muffled] Okay.
Luna Eclipsed,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"There's something I want you to see. And I promise that it's safe, but you really, really, really can't shriek. Do you promise not to shriek?"
Luna Eclipsed,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Pinkie Pie, you remember Princess Luna, right?"
Luna Eclipsed,M. A. Larson,princess luna,Ah. The ringleader of the frightened children. Hast thou come to make peace?
Luna Eclipsed,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,Rainbow!
Luna Eclipsed,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"She's changed, Pinkie! She's not evil or scary anymore! And she definitely doesn't want to gobble you up!"
Luna Eclipsed,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,"Well, duh."
Luna Eclipsed,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,Huh?
Luna Eclipsed,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,"I know that. Sheesh, Twilight. I'm almost as big as her, how's she gonna gobble me up?"
Luna Eclipsed,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,So why do you keep running away and screaming?
Luna Eclipsed,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,Sometimes it's just really fun to be scared!
Luna Eclipsed,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Fun? Pinkie Pie, you're a genius!"
Luna Eclipsed,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,Princess Luna! I've finally figured out why you're having so much trouble being liked!
Luna Eclipsed,M. A. Larson,princess luna,[deadpan] Forgive me if I withhold my enthusiasm.
Luna Eclipsed,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,Come with me. I'll explain everything on the way.
Luna Eclipsed,M. A. Larson,pipsqueak,Gosh. I never thought my very first Nightmare Night would be my very last.
Luna Eclipsed,M. A. Larson,zecora,"Come, little Pip. Now don't you fret. Nightmare Night's not over yet. We still have candy left to give, so Nightmare Moon might let us live."
Luna Eclipsed,M. A. Larson,mayor mare,"Yes. Come on, little ponies. What's Nightmare Night without the annual candy offering? You don't want Nightmare Moon to gobble you up, do you?"
Luna Eclipsed,M. A. Larson,spike,"Aw, the rainbow wig just kills it for me."
Luna Eclipsed,M. A. Larson,applejack,"Come on, kids! Doesn't that sound like fun?"
Luna Eclipsed,M. A. Larson,pipsqueak,"Goodbye, Nightmare Night. Forever."
Luna Eclipsed,M. A. Larson,nightmare moon,[booming voice] Citizens of Ponyville! You were wise to bring this candy to me. I am pleased with your offering. So pleased that I may just eat it... instead of eating you!
Luna Eclipsed,M. A. Larson,princess luna,"[spit] I am not certain that did what you meant for it to do, Twilight Sparkle."
Luna Eclipsed,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,Just wait.
Luna Eclipsed,M. A. Larson,princess luna,For what? For... for them to scream some more?
Luna Eclipsed,M. A. Larson,pipsqueak,"Um... Princess Luna. I know there's not gonna be any more Nightmare Night, but do you suppose maybe you could come back next year and scare us again anyway?"
Luna Eclipsed,M. A. Larson,princess luna,Child. Art thou saying that thou... likest me to scare you?
Luna Eclipsed,M. A. Larson,pipsqueak,"It's really fun! Scary, but fun!"
Luna Eclipsed,M. A. Larson,princess luna,It... is?
Luna Eclipsed,M. A. Larson,pipsqueak,Yeah! Nightmare Night is my favorite night of the year.
Luna Eclipsed,M. A. Larson,princess luna,Well then. We shall have to bring [booming voice] Nightmare Night back!
Luna Eclipsed,M. A. Larson,pipsqueak,"Whoa! You're my favorite princess ever! [to foals] She said yes, guys!"
Luna Eclipsed,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"See? They really do like you, princess."
Luna Eclipsed,M. A. Larson,princess luna,"Can it be true? [thunder, booming voice] Oh, most wonderful of -- [normal voice] I mean... Oh, most wonderful of nights."
Luna Eclipsed,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Dear Princess Celestia,"
Luna Eclipsed,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"When you first sent me to Ponyville, I didn't know anything about friendship. I met somepony tonight who was having the same problem -- your sister, Princess Luna! She taught me that one of the best things you can do with friendship is to give it to others, and help them find it themselves! And I'm happy to report that all of Ponyville has learned that even if somepony seems a little intimidating, even scary, when you offer them your friendship, you'll discover a whole new pony underneath. And even if my Star Swirl the Bearded costume didn't go over, this still turned out to be the best Nightmare Night ever!"
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,"Rarity! Rrgh, you ruined the surprise! I was gonna serve you breakfast in bed!"
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,rarity,Father! Mother!
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,rarity,I... figured. [sniffs] I didn't know you could burn juice.
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,rarity,Vacation? Is that this week? As in 'starting this very instant' this week?! Uurh. Let me guess: apple sauce?
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,Nope. Toast! We're gonna have the bestest time two sisters could ever have! I'm gonna go grab my stuff from Dad's wagon.
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,rarity,"So, now, when you say 'a week'... is that, um, seven whole days?"
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,rarity,"But I've got such a long to-do list. Oh well, I suppose 'spend time with your sister' will just have to be added to the list."
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,Just a few necessities.
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,rarity,"Now, let's get that kitchen all cleaned up."
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,Cleaned up? But we haven't even eaten yet.
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,rarity,"Well now, Sweetie Belle, I appreciate the gesture, but we simply can't eat this breakfast; it's burnt."
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,It's not that burnt.
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,rarity,"Never fear, my dear, I'll get a proper breakfast going."
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,Can I help?
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,rarity,"Oh, er, of course, er, in one moment, Sweetie Belle. Let me just get things started."
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,Rarity! I thought you said I was gonna help!
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,rarity,You are! You... can... put the garnish on the plates.
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,You mean this parsley?
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,rarity,"Okay, now, easy! It has to be just right! No need to rush. No! That's too slow. Careful! Back up! Looking for perfection here..."
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,"Whoa, whoa!"
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,rarity,Not... bad.
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,rarity,[gasp] There are some things I must attend to. Can you take the dirty towels to the laundry room?
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,"No problem, I'll make myself useful!"
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,rarity,Sweetie Belle!
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,I told you I'd make myself useful. Surprised?
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,rarity,Am I? You washed my incredibly expensive one-of-a-kind designer crocheted wool sweater! Do you know how hard these things are to come by?
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,What's the big deal?
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,rarity,"The big deal is that in the heat of the sun, wool... shrinks."
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,Oh. Sorry.
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,rarity,Nng... Well. Back to work. I must create.
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,Sorry?
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,rarity,"Huh. Stay out of trouble, okay? Please?"
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,I just wanted to do something nice for my sister.
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,"Raargh, I'm so bored! When is Rarity gonna finish her work?"
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,rarity,"[in Sweetie Belle's mind] Stay out of trouble, okay?"
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,I never got in trouble for drawing. Hmm. This needs something...
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,"Hi, Rarity! I made a special drawing for y<U+0096>"
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,rarity,[screams] Oh no! Did you use these gems?!
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,"Well, yes, but I know you'll have more in your work room..."
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,rarity,"But, but these are extremely rare baby blue sapphires! I need them for an outfit for an extremely important client!"
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,Oh. Sorry.
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,rarity,"[sigh] Sweetie Belle, what am I going to do with you?"
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,"Oh! We could paint together, we could ride bikes, play chess, sing a song, catch frogs, pillow fight<U+0096>"
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,rarity,That's not what I meant!
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,Oh.
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,rarity,Now I have to go and find some more of these gems!
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,I'll go with you and help!
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,rarity,"No! No thank you. You can help by picking up these papers and stacking them, neatly. Put the pens and pencils back exactly where you found them, and please find something to do that doesn't create a large mess for me to clean up!"
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,"Geez Louise, can't I do anything right?"
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,Surprise!
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,rarity,My- ee- bleh- My inspiration room! What did you do? What did you do?!
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,"When I saw the big mess in your room, I thought I'd clean it up for you."
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,rarity,"This wasn't a mess! It was organized chaos! I was just about finished planning my new fashion line, and, and you, you, you went and, and you<U+0096> and you put everything away!"
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,"But every time I make a mess, you get upset!"
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,rarity,But this was my mess in my house! And now I have to start from scratch!
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,"But, I thought it would make you happy!"
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,rarity,Happy?! Happy?! I<U+0096> [grinds teeth] I just need some time alone. Hm!
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,How's the sleepover at Rarity's goin'?
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,"[mimicking Rarity] Why, it's smashing!"
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,Huh?
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,I just wish we could do something special together that didn't include me goofing anything up.
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,The Sisterhooves Social! Applejack an' I do it every year! You an' Rarity can compete against other sister teams in all these neat events!
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,That sounds like the perfect way for us to hang out! Rarity will think it's an excellent idea.
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,rarity,What a ridiculous idea. A contest at Sweet Apple Acres? It doesn't sound... very... clean.
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,"So, what, now you're back to hating messes?"
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,rarity,"Sweetie Belle, watch your tone! I am still your big sister."
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,Right! And any sister who cares about her sister goes!
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,rarity,Sweetie Belle...! Honestly! Playing silly little games in the dirt is just... uncouth! With or without a sister.
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,"Well then! Maybe, maybe I'll try the Sisterhooves Social without a sister! In fact, I think I'll try the rest of my life without a sister!"
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,rarity,"[gasp] Oh, I'm the one who's ruining your life?! Really?! Have you looked around this place? I'm the one who'd be better off with no sister!"
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,Well it looks like we finally agree on something! Neither of us needs a sister!
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,rarity,Deal!
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,"Deal! Goodbye, un-sister!"
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,rarity,Hmph!
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,applejack,'Uncouth'? She said the Sisterhooves Social was 'uncouth'?
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,Yeah! Uncouth? [belch] Wait. What's uncouth?
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,It's not just the Social. She thinks I'm uncouth.
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,applejack,"Honey, Rarity thinks everything's uncouth."
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,[with mouth full] What's uncouth?
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,applejack,"It means uncivil. Y'know, bad mannered?"
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,applejack,"Exactly. Sweetie Belle, just give Rarity some time. She'll come around. Sisters always do."
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,Not sisters like Rarity.
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,applejack,"Come on, now. Apple Bloom and I got some chores to finish up on. Maybe you can help!"
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,You sure you want me to help? I just mess everything up!
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,applejack,"Oh, come on, that's just stinkin' thinkin'. Watch!"
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,applejack,"Good catch there, Apple Bloom! Whoo!"
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,This is a chore?
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,applejack,"Since we can't sell the bruised apples, we gotta collect them all for the pigs to eat."
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,"It's a lot of work, so we make a game of it. Wanna try?"
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,"Um, okay. Ow! You're right, it is hard work."
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,That's why we do it...
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,"Huh, Rarity never wants to do chores together."
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,rarity,"Ugh, all that work ruined, thanks to Sweetie Belle. Oh my. It's usually a big mess in here. [gasp] Id-ee-a! This is genius! I shall call it 'full spectrum fashions'! If Sweetie Belle hadn't<U+0096> [clears throat] Well, no matter. She still shouldn't have touched my things without permission. Hm!"
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,applejack,Apple Bloom! You're up!
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,You're... making... grape juice? Rarity would call the fashion police on me if I got grape juice anywhere near her precious outfits.
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,"Well, that's silly!"
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,applejack,Apple Bloom...
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,"Please, Applejack, she didn't mean<U+0096>"
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,applejack,"How d'you like them grapes, y'little whippersnapper!"
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,rarity,"Now to get these fabrics washed for my fabulous new line. Ooh, my favorite sweater... I just can't believe that Sweetie Belle."
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,rarity,"Oh, Opal-wopal! It's as if Sweetie Belle knew the sweater was perfect for you. And Sweetie Belle should consider herself perfectly lucky that this thoughtless mishap turned out all right. Hm."
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,applejack,Apple Bloom!
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,"Got it, sis!"
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,Wow. It's as if they were just one pony.
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,applejack,"Way to corral some critters, sis!"
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,Rarity never high-hoofs me.
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,rarity,"Perfect! Just one more, and this ensemble is fini! Rrgh, Sweetie Belle! Where's her silly little arts and crafts project?"
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,rarity,"Oh, Sweetie Belle! My one and only sister! What have I done? All the time I could have spent with you was wasted complaining and wishing you were gone! [crying dramatically] Woe is me! No! I must get her back! I must! As Celestia is my witness, I shall never be sisterless again!"
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,rarity,"[gasp] Sweetie Belle! Oh, I have been galloping all over looking for you. I<U+0096>"
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,"Oh hello, un-sister. What are you doing here? Better be careful, you might get some dust on you."
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,rarity,"Oh, Sweetie Belle, I want to apologize. I am not better off without a sister."
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,I'm not better off without a sister either. Spending the day with Applejack and Apple Bloom made me realize that.
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,rarity,"Oh, Sweetie, you don't know how happy I am to hear<U+0096>"
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,And that's why I'm adopting Applejack as my big sister!
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,rarity,What?!
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,applejack,What?!
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,What?!
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,A sister is someone who loves and takes care of another sister. Applejack's a real sister.
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,applejack,"H-Hold on, Sweetie Belle. Don't get ahead of yourself here."
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,"Besides, she's my big sister!"
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,applejack,"Yeah, um<U+0096>"
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,"[to Rarity] Or maybe she should be your sister, so she could teach you what a good sister is supposed to be!"
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,applejack,"Heh, um, actually, I<U+0096>"
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,rarity,"But I don't need lessons on being a good sister, I-I promise! Listen! I'll show you how to cook my favorite quiche! Or, or, I'll show you the proper way to beautify your mane. Won't that be fun? Hm?"
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,"Hm! You want me to go home with you, so we can do what you wanna do?"
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,rarity,Uh... yes?
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,Just forget it!
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,"We're still sisters, right?"
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,rarity,"Well, that apology went swimmingly. Applejack, why do you have to be so good and make me look so bad?"
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,applejack,"[chuckles] Oh Rarity, once again you're thinkin' about yourself. Bein' sisters is a give and take. You've been doin' a whole lotta takin', but you haven't been doin' a whole lotta givin'."
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,rarity,But of course I give. I give lessons. Reasonable demands.
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,applejack,"But ya never give in. Bein' sisters is like... apple pie. You can have amazin' apples, and you can have a wonderfully crispy crust, but only together you can have a perfect apple pie."
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,rarity,"But apart, all we are is just a pile of mush and some crumbly dry mess... [gasp] I know what I need to do! I just hope it isn't too late!"
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,"Well, I guess it's a good thing Rarity isn't here. Do I see 'uncouth' written all over this contest?"
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,Look at the size of that pig!
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,applejack,He sure is a cutie.
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,"That's the last word Rarity would use. [mimicking Rarity] Oh my, what a repulsive monstrosity! This thing needs a head to toe makeover!"
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,applejack,It's almost time!
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,"Well, you two have fun. Sure wish I had a sister to run the race with. Huh?"
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,You do now!
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,applejack,AB and I figured since we do this every year...
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,I'd let you borrow my sis so you can give it a try!
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,applejack,Sister for a day.
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,No way!
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,One. Day. One. Day.
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,granny smith,"Is this thing on? [to Big McIntosh] I don't think this thing is on. [to the megaphone] Hello! [Big McIntosh whispers into her ear] What is the- e- oh. You have to say so. Confangled modern doohickeys. Now, the event you've all been waiting fer! The Sister Soci- The Socialhooves- Oh, dabnabbit, you know, the big race! We have five teams this year fer the event! So y'all head on up to the finish line, y'hear? [Big McIntosh whispers into her ear] [to Big McIntosh] Eh? [to the megaphone] The start line! [to Big McIntosh] That's what I said."
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,That's us.
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,One. Day. Good luck!
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,granny smith,And may the best sisters win! On your marks... get set... Gooooo!
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,"You okay, Applejack?"
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,"Applejack, help!"
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,"You can do it, sister!"
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,"Ooh, so close! You almost won!"
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,"Thank you, Applejack! You were amazing! I don't even care that we didn't win. This was so much fun! Huh? Rarity?! Wait, where's Applejack?"
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,I don't get it.
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,applejack,[chuckles] We switched places over at the very first mudhole.
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,"So, we did the whole competition... together?"
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,rarity,"That we did, little sister. Well, except for the start line."
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,But you finished together!
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,You mean... you were all in on it?
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,You did this for me?
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,rarity,Us. I did it for us. You see? We are apple pie!
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,Huh?
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,rarity,"Uh, I'll explain later. For now, I think we deserve a celebration!"
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,Where?
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,rarity,"The spa, of course."
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,"Oh, Rarity."
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,rarity,"No, I-I-I'm serious."
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,rarity,"Very well then, what should we write to the Princess?"
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,I'll start. Having a sister is just about the bestest thing in the world. But it sure isn't the easiest.
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,rarity,"I agree that being sisters is a wonderful thing, but it takes teamwork. Sometimes it's about compromising. Sometimes it's about accepting each others' differences. But mostly, it's about having fun together. Even if it means getting your hooves a little bit dirty."
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,A lot dirty.
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,rarity,A little bit dirty.
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,A lot dirty.
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,rarity,A little bit dirty!
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,A lo<U+0096>
Sisterhooves Social,Cindy Morrow,spike,"Hold it, hold it! How about ""a medium amount of dirty, not too little, not too much, just right""?"
The Cutie Pox,Amy Keating Rogers,apple bloom,"Today's the day, Cutie Mark Crusaders! I can just feel it! Today's the day we are all gonna get our cutie marks in... bowlin'!"
The Cutie Pox,Amy Keating Rogers,scootaloo,Whoo-hoo!
The Cutie Pox,Amy Keating Rogers,sweetie belle,"[muffled] Whooo! [spits out bag] I mean, yaay!"
The Cutie Pox,Amy Keating Rogers,apple bloom,"Why, after today, we won't even be the Cutie Mark Crusaders anymore! We'll be the... the Three Strikes!"
The Cutie Pox,Amy Keating Rogers,scootaloo,That makes us sound like we've struck out.
The Cutie Pox,Amy Keating Rogers,apple bloom,Mmm. How 'bout the Pin Twins?
The Cutie Pox,Amy Keating Rogers,sweetie belle,But there are three of us.
The Cutie Pox,Amy Keating Rogers,apple bloom,Okay then... Um... the Bowlin' Dolls!
The Cutie Pox,Amy Keating Rogers,sweetie belle,The Bowling Dolls! That's it!
The Cutie Pox,Amy Keating Rogers,scootaloo,Perfect!
The Cutie Pox,Amy Keating Rogers,apple bloom,All righty then! Let's bowl 'em over!
The Cutie Pox,Amy Keating Rogers,apple bloom,Phpoo!
The Cutie Pox,Amy Keating Rogers,apple bloom,I did it! I did it! Blank?
The Cutie Pox,Amy Keating Rogers,apple bloom,But... but... what about my ball?
The Cutie Pox,Amy Keating Rogers,sweetie belle,"That bowling sure was fun, even if all I got was gutter balls."
The Cutie Pox,Amy Keating Rogers,scootaloo,"Yeah, at least you were able to keep your ball in your lane. I don't think Mr. Kingpin is ever gonna let me play again! Hey, maybe I could get my cutie mark in demolition!"
The Cutie Pox,Amy Keating Rogers,scootaloo,"Aw, come on, Apple Bloom."
The Cutie Pox,Amy Keating Rogers,sweetie belle,I know just what you need to put the bloom back on your apple.
The Cutie Pox,Amy Keating Rogers,sweetie belle,A treat from Sugarcube Corner will cheer you up.
The Cutie Pox,Amy Keating Rogers,apple bloom,"No, it won't."
The Cutie Pox,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,A party will cheer you up!
The Cutie Pox,Amy Keating Rogers,apple bloom,"No, it won't."
The Cutie Pox,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,A lovely new chapeau will cheer you up.
The Cutie Pox,Amy Keating Rogers,apple bloom,"No, it won't."
The Cutie Pox,Amy Keating Rogers,scootaloo,"Come on, Apple Bloom, it's just a cutie mark!"
The Cutie Pox,Amy Keating Rogers,sweetie belle,Or lack of a cutie mark!
The Cutie Pox,Amy Keating Rogers,scootaloo,"Shh! That's not helping! Apple Bloom! Where are you going?! Apple Bloom, come back!"
The Cutie Pox,Amy Keating Rogers,apple bloom,Whoa! Ah! Ooh! Ow! Nnnn...
The Cutie Pox,Amy Keating Rogers,zecora,"Well, who is it that we have here? Why, it's Apple Bloom, my dear!"
The Cutie Pox,Amy Keating Rogers,apple bloom,Ow...
The Cutie Pox,Amy Keating Rogers,zecora,"What has happened to you, youth? Ah, you've gone and chipped your tooth. Come with me, I have just the trick that will fix you up quite quick."
The Cutie Pox,Amy Keating Rogers,apple bloom,"[with a lisp] I've tried everything, Zecora, and still no cutie mark! Well, I'm gonna be as old as Granny Smith and still have a blank flank!"
The Cutie Pox,Amy Keating Rogers,zecora,"Your frustration is well understood, but one must be patient for all things good."
The Cutie Pox,Amy Keating Rogers,apple bloom,"[with a lisp] Ugh, I've heard that from every pony I know! And now from every zebra I know! I'm just too impatient to be patient. I just want my cutie mark and I want it now!"
The Cutie Pox,Amy Keating Rogers,zecora,"For your cutie mark, you will have to wait. We must fix that tooth before it's too late. Now drink down every little drop, and this mixture will mend that chip on top!"
The Cutie Pox,Amy Keating Rogers,apple bloom,"[glug, glug] Oh my star apples, you did it, Zecora! Golly, you have tonics that heal all sorts of ailments. Bad bones, bad back, bad breath..."
The Cutie Pox,Amy Keating Rogers,zecora,"Yes little one, it is true, I have many a healing brew."
The Cutie Pox,Amy Keating Rogers,apple bloom,"And not only stuff that fixes the bad, but stuff that brings the good! Good health, good hair... good heavens! Hmm... I bet you can mix up a brew to fix... anything."
The Cutie Pox,Amy Keating Rogers,zecora,"There are many mixtures in this room, but none for what you want, dear Apple Bloom. A magic potion does not hold the key. For a cutie mark, time is the only remedy."
The Cutie Pox,Amy Keating Rogers,apple bloom,Fine. Whatcha got goin' on there?
The Cutie Pox,Amy Keating Rogers,zecora,"I am brewing up another mix for a rooster and his chicks. [muffled] It seems the rooster has lost his crow, [normal] making mornings very slow."
The Cutie Pox,Amy Keating Rogers,apple bloom,"Hey, I've seen that flower bloomin' in Ponyville! What is it?"
The Cutie Pox,Amy Keating Rogers,zecora,"It is one we call 'Heart's Desire'. A dash will ignite the rooster's fire. With Heart's Desire, his talent comes into view, and he'll give a mighty cock-a-doodle-doo!"
The Cutie Pox,Amy Keating Rogers,apple bloom,"Zowie! Heart's Desire, huh?"
The Cutie Pox,Amy Keating Rogers,zecora,"Ay me, but what is this? I have run out of amethyst. I must go get this purple flower for my brew to have full power!"
The Cutie Pox,Amy Keating Rogers,apple bloom,"Yeah, you go, you go."
The Cutie Pox,Amy Keating Rogers,sweetie belle,I'm so hungry.
The Cutie Pox,Amy Keating Rogers,scootaloo,"Yeah, I can't wai--"
The Cutie Pox,Amy Keating Rogers,sweetie belle,"Um, Apple Bloom... what is it?"
The Cutie Pox,Amy Keating Rogers,scootaloo,Yeah! Is it an 'o'? Is your talent spelling?
The Cutie Pox,Amy Keating Rogers,sweetie belle,Or is it a ring? Are you a jewelry maker?
The Cutie Pox,Amy Keating Rogers,apple bloom,"No, it's a loop-de-hoop!"
The Cutie Pox,Amy Keating Rogers,scootaloo,[gasp] A what now?
The Cutie Pox,Amy Keating Rogers,apple bloom,"A loop-de-hoop! 'Least, that's what I always called it. Applejack made it for me from an old rain barrel when I was littler! Who woulda thought that loop-de-hoop would end up bein' my special talent?"
The Cutie Pox,Amy Keating Rogers,sweetie belle,"Wow, Apple Bloom, that's amazing!"
The Cutie Pox,Amy Keating Rogers,diamond tiara,That's it? That's your talent?
The Cutie Pox,Amy Keating Rogers,silver spoon,Spinning a hoop around your waist? Puh-lease.
The Cutie Pox,Amy Keating Rogers,apple bloom,"Oh, you ain't seen nothin' yet."
The Cutie Pox,Amy Keating Rogers,scootaloo,"Apple Bloom, you're super-duper-loop-de-hooper!"
The Cutie Pox,Amy Keating Rogers,apple bloom,"Thanks, everypony!"
The Cutie Pox,Amy Keating Rogers,cheerilee,"All right, my little ponies, time for class!"
The Cutie Pox,Amy Keating Rogers,cheerilee,Apple Bloom?
The Cutie Pox,Amy Keating Rogers,apple bloom,"Yes, Miss Cheerilee?"
The Cutie Pox,Amy Keating Rogers,cheerilee,I want you to take your loop-de-hoop into the yard... and give us all a lesson in your amazing loop-de-hooping!
The Cutie Pox,Amy Keating Rogers,apple bloom,"Don't worry, gals. Keep at it and you might get to be half as good as me!"
The Cutie Pox,Amy Keating Rogers,apple bloom,"Great job, girls!"
The Cutie Pox,Amy Keating Rogers,sweetie belle,"You're too kind, Apple Bloom."
The Cutie Pox,Amy Keating Rogers,scootaloo,"Yeah, we stink."
The Cutie Pox,Amy Keating Rogers,apple bloom,"Nah, you just need a little practice. Soon you'll be able to... hoop and bop! Hoop and hop! [muffled] Hoop and skip! [normal] And hoop and flip!"
The Cutie Pox,Amy Keating Rogers,cheerilee,"[laughs] Show us some more, Apple Bloom."
The Cutie Pox,Amy Keating Rogers,apple bloom,"Well, all right, just a few more tricks. But be warned! These are advanced moves, not for beginners. Got that, Diamond Tiara?"
The Cutie Pox,Amy Keating Rogers,apple bloom,I call this one the hoop-la! [makes helicopter noises] Huh? Oof!
The Cutie Pox,Amy Keating Rogers,diamond tiara,Another cutie mark? Hah! I guess that last trick was a lot of hoopla. Those cutie marks are fake!
The Cutie Pox,Amy Keating Rogers,apple bloom,What? No they're not!
The Cutie Pox,Amy Keating Rogers,diamond tiara,"Miss Cheerilee, have you ever heard of a pony with two cutie marks?"
The Cutie Pox,Amy Keating Rogers,cheerilee,"I must say that I never have, but maybe Apple Bloom has two special talents!"
The Cutie Pox,Amy Keating Rogers,silver spoon,Oh yeah? Then let's see you do that!
The Cutie Pox,Amy Keating Rogers,snips,Spin plates!
The Cutie Pox,Amy Keating Rogers,snails,Yeah!
The Cutie Pox,Amy Keating Rogers,sweetie belle,Two cutie marks?
The Cutie Pox,Amy Keating Rogers,scootaloo,Two talents?
The Cutie Pox,Amy Keating Rogers,apple bloom,Aw yeah!
The Cutie Pox,Amy Keating Rogers,sweetie belle,Our friend is the most...
The Cutie Pox,Amy Keating Rogers,apple bloom,"Alright, everypony, You ready for a real show?"
The Cutie Pox,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"Yee-haw, little sis! Congratulations on gettin' not just one, but two cutie marks! We're mighty proud of you, right, Big McIntosh?"
The Cutie Pox,Amy Keating Rogers,big mcintosh,Eeyup.
The Cutie Pox,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"I've never seen anythin' like it. Have you, Big Mac?"
The Cutie Pox,Amy Keating Rogers,big mcintosh,Nnnope.
The Cutie Pox,Amy Keating Rogers,granny smith,"Why, the way you were a-hoopin' and a-hoppin' and kickin' and spinnin' reminded me of when I was a spry young filly. Guh, charley horse, charley horse! Ooh, that's better."
The Cutie Pox,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"Why, Apple Bloom, I think you're ready to hit the rodeo circuit right now!"
The Cutie Pox,Amy Keating Rogers,apple bloom,"Actually, I'm ready to hit the hay right now. I'm plum tuckered. I'll see y'all in the mornin'. Night!"
The Cutie Pox,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"Night! Oh my, little Apple Bloom has finally blossomed, hasn't she, Big Mac?"
The Cutie Pox,Amy Keating Rogers,big mcintosh,Eeyup!
The Cutie Pox,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"[grunting] What in tarnation is that? Apple Bloom, what is all that awful... tapping? [gasp] Three cutie marks?!"
The Cutie Pox,Amy Keating Rogers,apple bloom,Help me!
The Cutie Pox,Amy Keating Rogers,apple bloom,Help me!
The Cutie Pox,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"C'mere, you! Ow! Ow! Whoa!"
The Cutie Pox,Amy Keating Rogers,apple bloom,"I'm sorry, Applejack! I dunno how to make it stop!"
The Cutie Pox,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"Well, I know somepony who might!"
The Cutie Pox,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,Three cutie marks. Three talents. I've never seen anything like it! I was just reading something about unusual equine illnesses. What was it?
The Cutie Pox,Amy Keating Rogers,spike,"""Perplexing Pony Plagues"", perhaps?"
The Cutie Pox,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"Yes, Spike, you're amazing!"
The Cutie Pox,Amy Keating Rogers,spike,"Yes, well, I do have some talents."
The Cutie Pox,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,Hay fever... the trots... [gasp] Cutie pox!
The Cutie Pox,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,Cutie pox. This puzzling pony plague afflicted a population of ponies back in the Paleopony Period!
The Cutie Pox,Amy Keating Rogers,spike,"Heh, say that ten times fast!"
The Cutie Pox,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"Random cutie marks appeared all over the ponies' bodies, causing them to perform all the talents that came with them!"
The Cutie Pox,Amy Keating Rogers,apple bloom,Just like me!
The Cutie Pox,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"Yes, but what's the cure? What's the cure?!"
The Cutie Pox,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,It says here there's no known cure!
The Cutie Pox,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"The cause of the breakout was never discovered, and the cutie pox disappears as mysteriously as they arrived!"
The Cutie Pox,Amy Keating Rogers,apple bloom,"Oh, no! Sacr<e9> bleu! Plus de marques de cutie! [gasp] Qu'est-ce c'est?! Je parle Fran<e7>ais?!"
The Cutie Pox,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,My sister's speakin' in fancy!
The Cutie Pox,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,She needs help!
The Cutie Pox,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,I know she needs help! We can't just wait for this to go away! We gotta find somepony to mix up a cure! And fast!
The Cutie Pox,Amy Keating Rogers,apple bloom,Tout de suite!
The Cutie Pox,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,Not some pony... some zebra!
The Cutie Pox,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,Zecora!
The Cutie Pox,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"Hurry, hurry!"
The Cutie Pox,Amy Keating Rogers,apple bloom,D<e9>p<ea>chez-vous!
The Cutie Pox,Amy Keating Rogers,spike,"No, she's not."
The Cutie Pox,Amy Keating Rogers,spike,She just has some weird mysterious disease with no known cure called cutie pox.
The Cutie Pox,Amy Keating Rogers,zecora,I thought I had removed their fear the last time that I visited here. But doors are barred and shutters shut. Guess I should've stayed inside my hut.
The Cutie Pox,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,Zecora! Apple Bloom has cutie pox! We were just on our way to see if you had a cure!
The Cutie Pox,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,But magically you're here! Was your zebra sense a-tinglin'?
The Cutie Pox,Amy Keating Rogers,zecora,"My 'zebra sense' did not bring me round, it was a special flower that I needed found. I thought I picked enough to fix all the potions I had to mix, but after my visit from Apple Bloom, some had mysteriously left my room. Apple Bloom! What do you say? Did this flower just walk away?"
The Cutie Pox,Amy Keating Rogers,apple bloom,"I, um..."
The Cutie Pox,Amy Keating Rogers,zecora,"A cutie pox cure I have forsooth, for healing power is in the Seeds of Truth."
The Cutie Pox,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"Well, well then give 'em to her! Quick!"
The Cutie Pox,Amy Keating Rogers,zecora,"These seeds must be planted in the ground. With the truth, they'll grow, and the cure is found."
The Cutie Pox,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,Come again?
The Cutie Pox,Amy Keating Rogers,zecora,"The Seeds of Truth do hold the cure, but one must speak words, true and pure."
The Cutie Pox,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"Well then let's get to it! Alright, they're planted, now somepony tell the truth!"
The Cutie Pox,Amy Keating Rogers,apple bloom,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!"
The Cutie Pox,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,Somepony! Anypony!
The Cutie Pox,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"Yesterday I told Mrs. Cake that I ate two corn cakes, but I really ate three! Okay, six! I ate six corn cakes! [cries] Make it stop! Oh, make it stop!"
The Cutie Pox,Amy Keating Rogers,apple bloom,"Wah, I can't stand it any more! It's me! I admit it! I didn't earn my cutie mark! They're all fake! I figured the Heart's Desire would help me get what I wanted most! So when Zecora left her hut, I mixed up a special potion and put the rest of the Heart's Desire in it!"
The Cutie Pox,Amy Keating Rogers,apple bloom,"[chomps, chews and swallows] Ahh."
The Cutie Pox,Amy Keating Rogers,sweetie belle,Apple Bloom!
The Cutie Pox,Amy Keating Rogers,scootaloo,Are you okay?
The Cutie Pox,Amy Keating Rogers,apple bloom,"I'm great, and I've never been happier to be a blank flank. But I'm awful sorry I lied, 'specially to you gals. I was so desperate for my cutie mark, I just got carried away. And I'm really sorry I snuck those flowers from you, Zecora. Why, I wouldn't blame you if you never wanted me to come by again."
The Cutie Pox,Amy Keating Rogers,zecora,"Now, Apple Bloom, do not be silly. You are always welcome, my little filly. With each mistake you learn something new, growing up into a better you."
The Cutie Pox,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"Apple Bloom, would you mind writing to Princess Celestia and telling her what you've learned?"
The Cutie Pox,Amy Keating Rogers,apple bloom,"I'd be happy to, Twilight! Spike?"
The Cutie Pox,Amy Keating Rogers,spike,Ready!
The Cutie Pox,Amy Keating Rogers,apple bloom,"Dear Princess Celestia,"
The Cutie Pox,Amy Keating Rogers,apple bloom,"Waiting for what your heart desires can be really hard. So, you may try to take a shortcut. But this dishonesty never works, because you didn't earn what your heart desired. The only cure is being honest with yourself and others. And that's something every heart desires."
The Cutie Pox,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"I sure am proud of you, sis. Seems like you finally learned the importance of patience."
The Cutie Pox,Amy Keating Rogers,apple bloom,Yup! All good things come to those who wait. Well! I've waited long enough.
The Cutie Pox,Amy Keating Rogers,scootaloo,"Actually, that was way too long."
The Cutie Pox,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,What?!
The Cutie Pox,Amy Keating Rogers,apple bloom,So what are we gonna do today to earn our cutie marks?
The Cutie Pox,Amy Keating Rogers,scootaloo,"Well, I was thinking, for a pony who's never mixed up a potion before, you sure stirred up something fierce."
The Cutie Pox,Amy Keating Rogers,sweetie belle,Yeah! So what if your talent is potion making?
The Cutie Pox,Amy Keating Rogers,apple bloom,"Oh my gosh, totally! Let's go talk to Zecora, now!"
The Cutie Pox,Amy Keating Rogers,sweetie belle,Yeah!
The Cutie Pox,Amy Keating Rogers,scootaloo,Woo-hoo!
May the Best Pet Win!,Charlotte Fullerton,rainbow dash,Ha-ha! Whoo-hoo! Yeah! [laughs] Whoa!
May the Best Pet Win!,Charlotte Fullerton,rainbow dash,"Winona? I mean... Winona's head?! Um, is this weird, or is it just me? Angel? Gummy?! Okay, this is officially beyond weird now and right on down to freaky town."
May the Best Pet Win!,Charlotte Fullerton,rainbow dash,[gasp] Yaaaaah!
May the Best Pet Win!,Charlotte Fullerton,rainbow dash,Whaa!
May the Best Pet Win!,Charlotte Fullerton,rainbow dash,Phew.
May the Best Pet Win!,Charlotte Fullerton,applejack,Let's get this thing started!
May the Best Pet Win!,Charlotte Fullerton,rarity,"Sincerest apologies, Rainbow, if our pets were bothering you."
May the Best Pet Win!,Charlotte Fullerton,rarity,"Say you're sorry, Opal."
May the Best Pet Win!,Charlotte Fullerton,rarity,She's... sorry.
May the Best Pet Win!,Charlotte Fullerton,rainbow dash,What are you all doing out here?
May the Best Pet Win!,Charlotte Fullerton,applejack,"Why, we always round up our critters for a regular ol' Pony Pet Playdate in this park."
May the Best Pet Win!,Charlotte Fullerton,rainbow dash,"Uh, you do?"
May the Best Pet Win!,Charlotte Fullerton,applejack,Same time every week.
May the Best Pet Win!,Charlotte Fullerton,fluttershy,I thought you knew. You didn't know? She didn't know?
May the Best Pet Win!,Charlotte Fullerton,twilight sparkle,"Well, we had initially planned on inviting Rainbow, of course, except<U+0096>"
May the Best Pet Win!,Charlotte Fullerton,pinkie pie,"We were totally gonna invite you, Rainbow, then Twilight remembered that you don't even have a pet, and Rarity remembered that you really like to take naps in the afternoon, so Applejack figured you wouldn't be missing out on anything anyway, and Fluttershy and I nodded our heads in agreement like this."
May the Best Pet Win!,Charlotte Fullerton,fluttershy,"Oh, please don't be mad at us."
May the Best Pet Win!,Charlotte Fullerton,rainbow dash,"Oh, I'm not mad. You all are right. Not much point of a Pony Pet Playdate for me if I'm a pony without a pet, right?"
May the Best Pet Win!,Charlotte Fullerton,applejack,"Eeexactly. So, if'n you'll excuse us..."
May the Best Pet Win!,Charlotte Fullerton,rainbow dash,"Hey, now wait a minute! Just because I don't have a pet now doesn't mean I never want a pet!"
May the Best Pet Win!,Charlotte Fullerton,fluttershy,"Ohh! Y, y, Oh, really? You really want a pet? Really? 'Cause I've got so many wonderful choices at my house! Oh, and I know you'll just love them! And they'll love you! Oh, and you'll be best friends forever and ever! Oh!"
May the Best Pet Win!,Charlotte Fullerton,fluttershy,"Now, Rainbow, my dear, I cannot express my delight It's abundantly clear That somewhere out here Is the pet that will suit you just right"
May the Best Pet Win!,Charlotte Fullerton,rainbow dash,"I can't wait to get started, but first let me set a few rules It's of utmost importance The pet that I get Is something that's awesome and cool"
May the Best Pet Win!,Charlotte Fullerton,fluttershy,"Awesome, cool, got it! I have so many wonderful choices, just wait, you will see"
May the Best Pet Win!,Charlotte Fullerton,rainbow dash,I need something real fast like a bullet to keep up with me
May the Best Pet Win!,Charlotte Fullerton,fluttershy,Sure! How 'bout a bunny? They're cutesy and wootsie and quick as can be
May the Best Pet Win!,Charlotte Fullerton,rainbow dash,Cutesy? Wootsie? Have you even met me?
May the Best Pet Win!,Charlotte Fullerton,fluttershy,"Rainbow, have faith You see, I will bet you Somewhere in here is the pet that will get you"
May the Best Pet Win!,Charlotte Fullerton,fluttershy,"Come on, the sky's the limit!"
May the Best Pet Win!,Charlotte Fullerton,rainbow dash,Sky is good. I'd like it to fly.
May the Best Pet Win!,Charlotte Fullerton,fluttershy,"Really? Because I think this widdle puddy tat has your name written all over it. Yes, he does. Aww, look, he likes you!"
May the Best Pet Win!,Charlotte Fullerton,rainbow dash,Pass.
May the Best Pet Win!,Charlotte Fullerton,fluttershy,I have so many wonderful choices for you to decide There are otters and seals With massive appeal
May the Best Pet Win!,Charlotte Fullerton,rainbow dash,Otters and seals do not fly.
May the Best Pet Win!,Charlotte Fullerton,fluttershy,"Maybe not, but I've seen this particular seal catch ten feet of air when he breaches the water!"
May the Best Pet Win!,Charlotte Fullerton,rainbow dash,That's it. I'm outta here.
May the Best Pet Win!,Charlotte Fullerton,fluttershy,"Wait! There must be a pet here That will fit the ticket How 'bout a ladybug, or a cute cricket?"
May the Best Pet Win!,Charlotte Fullerton,rainbow dash,Bigger. And cooler.
May the Best Pet Win!,Charlotte Fullerton,fluttershy,"Bigger, cooler. Right."
May the Best Pet Win!,Charlotte Fullerton,rainbow dash,It's just a squirrel.
May the Best Pet Win!,Charlotte Fullerton,fluttershy,Not just any squirrel. A flying squirrel!
May the Best Pet Win!,Charlotte Fullerton,rainbow dash,"...Yeah. So, like I was saying..."
May the Best Pet Win!,Charlotte Fullerton,fluttershy,I'm sensing you want an animal that can fly.
May the Best Pet Win!,Charlotte Fullerton,rainbow dash,Ya think?
May the Best Pet Win!,Charlotte Fullerton,fluttershy,I have plenty of wonderful creatures who soar in the sky Like a sweet hummingbird or a giant monarch butterfly
May the Best Pet Win!,Charlotte Fullerton,rainbow dash,"Better, but cooler."
May the Best Pet Win!,Charlotte Fullerton,fluttershy,"I see. How 'bout an owl, or a wasp, or a toucan? There's so many wonderful creatures the likes of that There are falcons and eagles They are both quite regal Or perhaps what you need is a dark and mysterious bat?"
May the Best Pet Win!,Charlotte Fullerton,rainbow dash,"Now you're talking! But instead of just one standout, now that's too many."
May the Best Pet Win!,Charlotte Fullerton,fluttershy,"Not a bad problem to have, if you ask me."
May the Best Pet Win!,Charlotte Fullerton,rainbow dash,"The bat would be awesome, but the wasp I'm digging too Do you have something in a yellow striped bat?"
May the Best Pet Win!,Charlotte Fullerton,fluttershy,No.
May the Best Pet Win!,Charlotte Fullerton,rainbow dash,"What to do, what to do? [gasp] A prize! That's it! There's really just one way To find out which animal's best Hold a contest of speed, agility, and guts That will put each pet to the test"
May the Best Pet Win!,Charlotte Fullerton,fluttershy,"Don't forget style, that should be considered"
May the Best Pet Win!,Charlotte Fullerton,rainbow dash,Then we'll know for sure who's best of the litter
May the Best Pet Win!,Charlotte Fullerton,fluttershy,The one who is awesome as cool
May the Best Pet Win!,Charlotte Fullerton,rainbow dash,"Just like me Can't settle for less, 'cause I'm the best"
May the Best Pet Win!,Charlotte Fullerton,rainbow dash,"Who's the number one, greatest, perfectest pet"
May the Best Pet Win!,Charlotte Fullerton,fluttershy,May the games
May the Best Pet Win!,Charlotte Fullerton,rainbow dash,And may the best pet win!
May the Best Pet Win!,Charlotte Fullerton,rainbow dash,"[blows whistle] Shh! [to assembled animals] So! You all think you've got what it takes to be my pet, do ya? Well, we'll just see about that! If any of you don't think you can handle it, bow out now before you humiliate yourself in front of your peers. This competition isn't for the weak. You'd better be prepared to step up your game! You call that flapping?! That's better. There's only room on Team Dash for one of you, and my future pet needs to be able to take it to the extreme! Any questions?"
May the Best Pet Win!,Charlotte Fullerton,applejack,I got one. Does she understand what a pet really needs?
May the Best Pet Win!,Charlotte Fullerton,twilight sparkle,"Yeah, like care and attention, love and affection<U+0096> Ugh! And breath mints!"
May the Best Pet Win!,Charlotte Fullerton,fluttershy,"Now, you just pay attention, and try your best, and<U+0096>"
May the Best Pet Win!,Charlotte Fullerton,rainbow dash,"Seriously, Fluttershy! The turtle? What did you bring that thing here for?"
May the Best Pet Win!,Charlotte Fullerton,fluttershy,"Technically he's a tortoise, and he's always dreamed of being somepony's pet. He just wants a chance to compete, he won't get in the way. You won't even know he's here."
May the Best Pet Win!,Charlotte Fullerton,rainbow dash,No.
May the Best Pet Win!,Charlotte Fullerton,fluttershy,"Oh, just let him try."
May the Best Pet Win!,Charlotte Fullerton,rainbow dash,"Ugh, but there's no way he can possibly keep up. Look at him!"
May the Best Pet Win!,Charlotte Fullerton,fluttershy,It won't hurt to let him try.
May the Best Pet Win!,Charlotte Fullerton,rainbow dash,But<U+0096>
May the Best Pet Win!,Charlotte Fullerton,fluttershy,Just let him try?
May the Best Pet Win!,Charlotte Fullerton,rainbow dash,"Grrgh, ugh, fine! But don't say I didn't warn you! This isn't a game, you know! Alright, now these games will determine which one of you has the most important qualities I'm looking for in a pet. Speed. Agility. Guts. Style. Coolness. Awesomeness. And radicalness."
May the Best Pet Win!,Charlotte Fullerton,twilight sparkle,Aren't those all the same thing?
May the Best Pet Win!,Charlotte Fullerton,rainbow dash,"You would think that, Twilight. And that's why you would never qualify to be my pet."
May the Best Pet Win!,Charlotte Fullerton,rainbow dash,Speed! On your marks...
May the Best Pet Win!,Charlotte Fullerton,rainbow dash,Get set... [blows whistle] Sorta speedy... not speedy... pretty speedy... could be more speedy...
May the Best Pet Win!,Charlotte Fullerton,rainbow dash,Yeah! That's speed!
May the Best Pet Win!,Charlotte Fullerton,rainbow dash,[to the tortoise] Tsk-tsk. That's just sad.
May the Best Pet Win!,Charlotte Fullerton,rainbow dash,Agility! Sorta agile... not agile... pretty agile... could be more agile... [to the tortoise] Wanna know the opposite of agility? That.
May the Best Pet Win!,Charlotte Fullerton,rainbow dash,"Yeah, baby, now that's what I call agility! [sing-song voice] Don't leave me hangin'! I'm gonna have to shave a point off your score for that."
May the Best Pet Win!,Charlotte Fullerton,rainbow dash,Okay! Which of you has the guts to try and get Opal's favorite toy away from her?
May the Best Pet Win!,Charlotte Fullerton,rainbow dash,Now that takes guts!
May the Best Pet Win!,Charlotte Fullerton,rainbow dash,"Style! Any pet of mine's gotta look good, 'cause you gotta make me look good!"
May the Best Pet Win!,Charlotte Fullerton,rainbow dash,Coolness!
May the Best Pet Win!,Charlotte Fullerton,rainbow dash,Sorta cool.
May the Best Pet Win!,Charlotte Fullerton,rainbow dash,Not cool.
May the Best Pet Win!,Charlotte Fullerton,rainbow dash,Pretty cool.
May the Best Pet Win!,Charlotte Fullerton,rainbow dash,Could be cooler.
May the Best Pet Win!,Charlotte Fullerton,rainbow dash,Not what I had in mind. I can't hear you!
May the Best Pet Win!,Charlotte Fullerton,rainbow dash,Eugh.
May the Best Pet Win!,Charlotte Fullerton,rainbow dash,Now that's a cool sound!
May the Best Pet Win!,Charlotte Fullerton,rainbow dash,"[to bat] Sorta awesome. [to toucan] Not awesome. [to flamingo] Could be more awesome. [to owl] Ho ho ho, yeah, that is awesome! [to tortoise] Uh, you did that already. That's pretty much all you can do, huh?"
May the Best Pet Win!,Charlotte Fullerton,rainbow dash,"Whoa! That was truly awesome! But I'm afraid this is the radicalness competition, so I'm gonna have to take some points off."
May the Best Pet Win!,Charlotte Fullerton,rainbow dash,"[sigh] Listen, turtle..."
May the Best Pet Win!,Charlotte Fullerton,fluttershy,Tortoise.
May the Best Pet Win!,Charlotte Fullerton,rainbow dash,"Whatever! You've had your fun, but I think you and I both know who made the cut and who didn't."
May the Best Pet Win!,Charlotte Fullerton,rainbow dash,You didn't.
May the Best Pet Win!,Charlotte Fullerton,rainbow dash,"I mean... 'A' for effort and everything, you gave it your best shot, maybe I've got a gold star sticker around here somewhere you can have, but, seriously, go home. You're starting to creep me out. So, anyway, you're all outstanding competitors, but there can only be one of you who's number one. So the final tie-breaking contest is going to be... pause for dramatic effect... a race against... me! Through Ghastly Gorge! Dun dun dun!"
May the Best Pet Win!,Charlotte Fullerton,rainbow dash,Gesundheit.
May the Best Pet Win!,Charlotte Fullerton,rainbow dash,"Actually, Ghastly Gorge isn't scary. It's fun. Heh. I've flown through it a million times myself, so obviously I'll be at the front of the pack. But whichever of you make it across the finish line with me will have proven you can keep up with me, and will have earned the honor and glory of getting to be my pet! Ready? Setgo!"
May the Best Pet Win!,Charlotte Fullerton,rainbow dash,Woo-hoo! Haha! Try to keep up!
May the Best Pet Win!,Charlotte Fullerton,rainbow dash,"Can't catch me, ha-ha!"
May the Best Pet Win!,Charlotte Fullerton,rainbow dash,"C'mon, slowpokes! You wanna win, don't ya?"
May the Best Pet Win!,Charlotte Fullerton,rainbow dash,"Oh! I forgot to tell you! Watch out for the Quarray eels! They don't like it when you get too close to their nests, like this. Whoa."
May the Best Pet Win!,Charlotte Fullerton,rainbow dash,"Easy, peasy, one-two-threesy! Right, guys?"
May the Best Pet Win!,Charlotte Fullerton,rainbow dash,AVALANCHE! Hey! Whoaaaa!
May the Best Pet Win!,Charlotte Fullerton,rainbow dash,"C'mon... No! Wait! Come back! Don't leave me! I'm the one who's supposed to win! I don't wanna end up stuck here... forever! Oh no, nonono, th-this can't be happening. Forever is way too long to be trapped in Ghastly Gorge. I mean, it's like, forever! Somepony! Anypony! Help me!"
May the Best Pet Win!,Charlotte Fullerton,rainbow dash,"Wahoo! My prayers have been answered! Oh, thankyouthankyoutha<U+0096> You?! Oh no! Now I'm not only going to be stuck here forever, I'm gonna be stuck here forever with the most annoying turtle in the world! Gyh, I'm doomed. DOOMED, I tell you!"
May the Best Pet Win!,Charlotte Fullerton,twilight sparkle,"Hm, something's not right here."
May the Best Pet Win!,Charlotte Fullerton,fluttershy,Where's Rainbow Dash?
May the Best Pet Win!,Charlotte Fullerton,applejack,Great galloping galoshes! There's been an avalanche in there!
May the Best Pet Win!,Charlotte Fullerton,spike,Rainbow!
May the Best Pet Win!,Charlotte Fullerton,pinkie pie,Wait! Look!
May the Best Pet Win!,Charlotte Fullerton,fluttershy,It's the turtle!
May the Best Pet Win!,Charlotte Fullerton,fluttershy,"Oh, whatever..."
May the Best Pet Win!,Charlotte Fullerton,twilight sparkle,And he's carrying something on his back...
May the Best Pet Win!,Charlotte Fullerton,pinkie pie,Ahh! It's Rainbow Dash! It's her! It's Rainbow!
May the Best Pet Win!,Charlotte Fullerton,fluttershy,Maybe we'd better go meet him halfway.
May the Best Pet Win!,Charlotte Fullerton,spike,"Huh. Way to go, little guy!"
May the Best Pet Win!,Charlotte Fullerton,twilight sparkle,"Oh, thank goodness you're not hurt, Rainbow!"
May the Best Pet Win!,Charlotte Fullerton,rainbow dash,Just my pride.
May the Best Pet Win!,Charlotte Fullerton,applejack,"It sure was, if'n it means Rainbow gets to have her own little critter just like the rest of us from now on."
May the Best Pet Win!,Charlotte Fullerton,rainbow dash,Uh... thanks. What you did... I owe you one.
May the Best Pet Win!,Charlotte Fullerton,fluttershy,Rainbow! Your new pet is over here waiting for you!
May the Best Pet Win!,Charlotte Fullerton,rainbow dash,Oh... Right... Yeah... That.
May the Best Pet Win!,Charlotte Fullerton,spike,What's the matter?
May the Best Pet Win!,Charlotte Fullerton,pinkie pie,"You got your perfect pet, right?"
May the Best Pet Win!,Charlotte Fullerton,fluttershy,"The best of the best like you wanted, remember? It can fly and it's not a squirrel! Should we sing about it again?"
May the Best Pet Win!,Charlotte Fullerton,applejack,"A falcon sure looks good on ya, Rainbow."
May the Best Pet Win!,Charlotte Fullerton,fluttershy,Yay?
May the Best Pet Win!,Charlotte Fullerton,rainbow dash,But I said whoever crosses the finish line with me gets to be my pet.
May the Best Pet Win!,Charlotte Fullerton,pinkie pie,"You did! You did say that! She did say that, that was the rule!"
May the Best Pet Win!,Charlotte Fullerton,rainbow dash,And the only racer who crossed the finish line with me was the one who stopped to save me when I needed help. The tortoise!
May the Best Pet Win!,Charlotte Fullerton,twilight sparkle,But what about the<U+0096>
May the Best Pet Win!,Charlotte Fullerton,applejack,Wouldja look at that? He even smiles slow.
May the Best Pet Win!,Charlotte Fullerton,rainbow dash,"Spike, take a letter. Dear Princess Celestia,"
May the Best Pet Win!,Charlotte Fullerton,rainbow dash,"I used to think that the most important traits to look for in a pet, or any best friend, were all physical competitive abilities. But now I can see how short-sighted and shallow that was."
May the Best Pet Win!,Charlotte Fullerton,rainbow dash,"Today I learned what the most important quality really is. A certain kind of spirit. A stick-to-it-ive-ness. A never give up, can-do attitude that's the mark of a real winner. And this tortoise has it."
May the Best Pet Win!,Charlotte Fullerton,twilight sparkle,Tenacity.
May the Best Pet Win!,Charlotte Fullerton,rainbow dash,Gesundheit. You just can't stop that little guy. He's like a... like a... Tank!
May the Best Pet Win!,Charlotte Fullerton,fluttershy,"But Rainbow! You didn't want a pet that couldn't fly because it would keep you grounded and hold you back, remember?"
May the Best Pet Win!,Charlotte Fullerton,rainbow dash,Hmm...
May the Best Pet Win!,Charlotte Fullerton,rainbow dash,"Heh. C'mon, Tank! We're gonna be late for our very first Pony Pet Playdate!"
The Mysterious Mare Do Well,Merriwether Williams,scootaloo,"Attention, everypony! Attention! The official Rainbow Dash Fan Club will come to order. Let's get right down to our first order of business. I motion that Rainbow Dash be declared the most awesome pony in Ponyville."
The Mysterious Mare Do Well,Merriwether Williams,snails,"I second the motion, and might I add that if you looked up the word 'awesome' in the dictionary, there would be a picture of Rainbow Dash."
The Mysterious Mare Do Well,Merriwether Williams,snips,I object!
The Mysterious Mare Do Well,Merriwether Williams,snips,I think the word 'awesome' is played out! Rainbow Dash deserves better! I motion that we declare her the most stupendous pony!
The Mysterious Mare Do Well,Merriwether Williams,scootaloo,'Stupendous'? Is that the best you've got? I motion that we declare her... wonderiffic!
The Mysterious Mare Do Well,Merriwether Williams,snips,Astonishing!
The Mysterious Mare Do Well,Merriwether Williams,scootaloo,Breathtaking!
The Mysterious Mare Do Well,Merriwether Williams,snips,Astounding!
The Mysterious Mare Do Well,Merriwether Williams,scootaloo,Bedazzling!
The Mysterious Mare Do Well,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,What about super-ultra-extreme-awesomazing?
The Mysterious Mare Do Well,Merriwether Williams,scootaloo,"All in favor of declaring Rainbow Dash the most 'super-ultra-extra-uh-whatever you said' pony in all of Ponyville, say 'aye'!"
The Mysterious Mare Do Well,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,[sigh] What a beautiful day. There's nothing like a dip in the clouds to make a Pegasus feel super relaxed.
The Mysterious Mare Do Well,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,"Looks like my sky swim will have to wait! I'm Rainbow Dash, and I'm here to rescue you!"
The Mysterious Mare Do Well,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,"Wow. What's with this crowd? Uh, thanks, everypony. It was really no big deal."
The Mysterious Mare Do Well,Merriwether Williams,scootaloo,That Rainbow Dash sure is something.
The Mysterious Mare Do Well,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,[gasps] Oh no! There's something wrong with the baby!
The Mysterious Mare Do Well,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,"She's not cheering for everypony's favorite hero, Rainbow Dash!"
The Mysterious Mare Do Well,Merriwether Williams,scootaloo,There just aren't enough words in the dictionary to describe Rainbow Dash's awesomeness.
The Mysterious Mare Do Well,Merriwether Williams,twilight sparkle,I can think of a few new words.
The Mysterious Mare Do Well,Merriwether Williams,applejack,And I bet 'modest' is not one of them.
The Mysterious Mare Do Well,Merriwether Williams,twilight sparkle,"No, but she is kinda awesome."
The Mysterious Mare Do Well,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,"Never fear, your friendly neighborhood Rainbow Dash is here!"
The Mysterious Mare Do Well,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,I can't hear you!
The Mysterious Mare Do Well,Merriwether Williams,twilight sparkle,"Call me silly, but I think this whole hero thing might be going to Rainbow Dash's head."
The Mysterious Mare Do Well,Merriwether Williams,pinkie pie,You may be right...silly.
The Mysterious Mare Do Well,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,"And then I zoomed into the well. I knew it would be dark and dangerous, but I didn't let that stop me. Danger's my middle name. Rainbow 'Danger' Dash. Thinking back on it, I acted pretty awesomely heroic that day."
The Mysterious Mare Do Well,Merriwether Williams,spike,That day.
The Mysterious Mare Do Well,Merriwether Williams,applejack,Awesomely heroic that day and awesomely arrogant ever since.
The Mysterious Mare Do Well,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,"Hey, Applejack. How'd you like to be immortalized as my friend?"
The Mysterious Mare Do Well,Merriwether Williams,applejack,Immorta-what?
The Mysterious Mare Do Well,Merriwether Williams,twilight sparkle,Are you taking notes?
The Mysterious Mare Do Well,Merriwether Williams,spike,"Yup! I've been hoof-picked by Rainbow Dash herself, to write her autobiography!"
The Mysterious Mare Do Well,Merriwether Williams,twilight sparkle,"Umm, autobiographies are supposed to be written by the pony they are about."
The Mysterious Mare Do Well,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,"Maybe for your normal, run-of-the-mill ponies. But I'm far too busy saving lives to stop and write. That's why I hired Spike as my ghost writer."
The Mysterious Mare Do Well,Merriwether Williams,pinkie pie,[yelps] Spike's a ghost!
The Mysterious Mare Do Well,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,"...Anyway. Spike here writes down everything I say. Don't you, Spike?"
The Mysterious Mare Do Well,Merriwether Williams,spike,Don't... you... Spike. Got it!
The Mysterious Mare Do Well,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,"This way, I can stay focused on performing those acts of bravery that nopony else has the guts to perform. Yep, it takes guts. But it also takes brains. And sometimes a big lunch and a nap. Being a hero is surely not for everypony, but I'm up to the challenge."
The Mysterious Mare Do Well,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,[grunts] There you go.
The Mysterious Mare Do Well,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,"Aim high, kid, but don't aim for the impossible."
The Mysterious Mare Do Well,Merriwether Williams,snips,"Uh, don't you think you should go and help?"
The Mysterious Mare Do Well,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,"[muffled] Yeah, yeah. I've got a good ten seconds to spare. Just a couple more."
The Mysterious Mare Do Well,Merriwether Williams,spike,The tension is unbearable. Will Rainbow Dash make it on time?
The Mysterious Mare Do Well,Merriwether Williams,mayor mare,That's right! Ponyville has a new hero. A mysterious mare that has done well by our fair city today. I dub this new masked hero 'The Mysterious Mare Do Well'!
The Mysterious Mare Do Well,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,"Mare Do Well, huh? Well that mare would do well to stay outta my way! Ponyville's only got room for one hero, and that hero is me!"
The Mysterious Mare Do Well,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,"[clears throat] Never fear, your friendly neighborhood Rainbow<U+0096>"
The Mysterious Mare Do Well,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,"Ugh, fine! Picky, picky. Whoaaaa! Aah!"
The Mysterious Mare Do Well,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,"I can't believe it. Mare Do Well is stronger than me? Well, a hero is more than just muscle, and she's gonna learn that the hard way."
The Mysterious Mare Do Well,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,"Huh? Never fear, your friendly neighbor<U+0096> Whoa!"
The Mysterious Mare Do Well,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,Never fear<U+0096> Uh! I'm coming! Hold on! Whoa!
The Mysterious Mare Do Well,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,"Here ya go, safe and sound."
The Mysterious Mare Do Well,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,"Well, Mare Do Well, or should I call you Mare Do Slow? You're gonna have to pick up the pace if you wanna compete with me, 'cause I move like lightning."
The Mysterious Mare Do Well,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,"[growls] Okay. She's strong, fast, and somehow knows what's gonna happen ahead of time. I've gotta step up my game."
The Mysterious Mare Do Well,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,"[gasps] If the dam breaks, the whole town will be flooded! Looks like Ponyville needs a hero! Easy peasy."
The Mysterious Mare Do Well,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,"My game is officially back on. If only somepony were here to pat me on the back. Eh, guess I'll have do it myself<U+0096> [yelps] [screams] Help! [spits] Help! You?! I suppose you want me to thank<U+0096> You gotta be kidding me..."
The Mysterious Mare Do Well,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,"Lemme get this straight. She's strong, she's agile, and she's magic? Ughhh! How do I compete with that? Wait a minute. I do have a leg up on her. And that leg is... wings! Hah! Take that, Mare Do Well!"
The Mysterious Mare Do Well,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,"Oh, for the love of Pete."
The Mysterious Mare Do Well,Merriwether Williams,applejack,"Gotta hand it to the girl, that Mare Do Well sure can pull off some pretty heroic feats."
The Mysterious Mare Do Well,Merriwether Williams,twilight sparkle,"I must say, I was impressed by that spell she used to fix the dam. Seems like something like that would take quite a bit of study."
The Mysterious Mare Do Well,Merriwether Williams,fluttershy,She really cares about everypony's safety.
The Mysterious Mare Do Well,Merriwether Williams,rarity,Have you seen her costume? It is to die for! If you ask me she's a hero of fashion.
The Mysterious Mare Do Well,Merriwether Williams,applejack,And she's modest and humble. She lets her actions speak for themselves. Gotta admire that.
The Mysterious Mare Do Well,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,I don't have to admire that! I don't think she's all that great!
The Mysterious Mare Do Well,Merriwether Williams,spike,She's... great.
The Mysterious Mare Do Well,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,I didn't say that.
The Mysterious Mare Do Well,Merriwether Williams,twilight sparkle,Sounds like somepony's jealous.
The Mysterious Mare Do Well,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,"Who, me?"
The Mysterious Mare Do Well,Merriwether Williams,spike,Rainbow Dash is jealous.
The Mysterious Mare Do Well,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,"Don't write that, Spike!"
The Mysterious Mare Do Well,Merriwether Williams,spike,Correction: Rainbow Dash is very jealous.
The Mysterious Mare Do Well,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,"Fine! Laugh all you want, but I'll be the one laughing when I prove to you all that I'm just as good<U+0096> no, that I'm a better hero than Mare Do Well!"
The Mysterious Mare Do Well,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,"Huh, no sign of trouble here. Darn it."
The Mysterious Mare Do Well,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,Buses and baby carriages are always careening down this hill. Where is an out-of-control vehicle when you need one?!
The Mysterious Mare Do Well,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,"Rrgh, there are absolutely no freak natural disasters going on anywhere! How am I supposed to prove myself when everything's so normal and safe? [gasps] Hold it right there, Granny Smith! You don't have to pretend with me. I can see that you're in way over your head here."
The Mysterious Mare Do Well,Merriwether Williams,granny smith,"Eh, what's that?"
The Mysterious Mare Do Well,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,"You're putting on a brave face, I get it. But you don't have to anymore. I'll help you cross the street!"
The Mysterious Mare Do Well,Merriwether Williams,granny smith,"[grunting] Actually, I can cross the street just fine!"
The Mysterious Mare Do Well,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,Don't worry! You're in extremely... capable... hooves!
The Mysterious Mare Do Well,Merriwether Williams,granny smith,[panicked grunts] Back off!
The Mysterious Mare Do Well,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,"[pants] Here we are! Safe and sound. A good and heroic citizen deserves a little recognition, don't you think?"
The Mysterious Mare Do Well,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,[gasps] Somepony's in trouble!
The Mysterious Mare Do Well,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,"You'd better let me handle this, ma'am! For your own safety, I must ask you to stand back!"
The Mysterious Mare Do Well,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,Ta-da!
The Mysterious Mare Do Well,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,How would you describe what I just did? Would you say I was amazing?
The Mysterious Mare Do Well,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,"Please, just answer the question! Was I, or was I not, amazing?"
The Mysterious Mare Do Well,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,"Oh, look!"
The Mysterious Mare Do Well,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,Another great feat of heroism! I have just saved that grass!
The Mysterious Mare Do Well,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,From weeds! Weeds that were attempting to eat this lawn!
The Mysterious Mare Do Well,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,"Aww, who am I kidding?"
The Mysterious Mare Do Well,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,"All anypony talks about is Mare Do Well this and Mare Do Well that! What about me? How could everypony forget about me so easily? I mean... have I changed? Same sleek body. Same flowing mane. Same spectacular hooves. Nope, I'm still awesome. They're wrong. But... then... why am I all alone? I hate being all alone."
The Mysterious Mare Do Well,Merriwether Williams,scootaloo,"Hey, Rainbow Dash!"
The Mysterious Mare Do Well,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,"I knew it! No need to apologize, squirt. Anypony could make that mistake."
The Mysterious Mare Do Well,Merriwether Williams,scootaloo,Mistake? What mistake?
The Mysterious Mare Do Well,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,Wait a minute. Why are you here?
The Mysterious Mare Do Well,Merriwether Williams,scootaloo,"To invite you to join us! We're heading off to the thank you parade for Ponyville's greatest hero, Mare Do Well."
The Mysterious Mare Do Well,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,No! No way! Can't you see I-I wanna be alone? I love being alone.
The Mysterious Mare Do Well,Merriwether Williams,scootaloo,"Oh, okay. See you later then."
The Mysterious Mare Do Well,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,"Yeah, right, like I'm gonna thank her. [mockingly] Thank you, Mare Do Well, whoever you are, for ruining e<U+0096> [normal] Hey, squirt! Wait up!"
The Mysterious Mare Do Well,Merriwether Williams,mayor mare,"Welcome to Ponyville's first, but surely not last, thank you parade, in honor of our city's greatest hero, the mysterious Mare Do Well!"
The Mysterious Mare Do Well,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,"The mysterious Mare Do Well, huh?"
The Mysterious Mare Do Well,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,So what are you hiding? Let's see how mysterious you are without that mask!
The Mysterious Mare Do Well,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,What the hay?
The Mysterious Mare Do Well,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,"Grrr... I got you now! Alright, Miss Mysterious! Mystery... solved! [yelps] P-p-p-p- Pinkie?! Whudda- hud-d-duh- hud-d-duh- huh?! Twilight?! Applejack?! There were three of you?!"
The Mysterious Mare Do Well,Merriwether Williams,twilight sparkle,"Yup, we all played Mare Do Well at different times."
The Mysterious Mare Do Well,Merriwether Williams,applejack,"I stopped the carriage bus with these babies, Bucky McGillicuddy and Kicks McGee."
The Mysterious Mare Do Well,Merriwether Williams,pinkie pie,It's alright.
The Mysterious Mare Do Well,Merriwether Williams,twilight sparkle,And I used my magic to fix the dam.
The Mysterious Mare Do Well,Merriwether Williams,fluttershy,"Ooh, ooh! And I did the flyby afterwards."
The Mysterious Mare Do Well,Merriwether Williams,rarity,I made the costumes. Fabulous if I do say so myself!
The Mysterious Mare Do Well,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,I don't understand. Why? Don't you want me to be a hero?
The Mysterious Mare Do Well,Merriwether Williams,twilight sparkle,Of course we want you to be a hero.
The Mysterious Mare Do Well,Merriwether Williams,applejack,But a real hero doesn't brag.
The Mysterious Mare Do Well,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,"Uh, I guess I did start to brag a little."
The Mysterious Mare Do Well,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,"Okay, a lot."
The Mysterious Mare Do Well,Merriwether Williams,twilight sparkle,Celebrating your accomplishments is natural. But...
The Mysterious Mare Do Well,Merriwether Williams,applejack,...Rubbin' them in everypony's face is not.
The Mysterious Mare Do Well,Merriwether Williams,applejack,I think we're getting off topic here.
The Mysterious Mare Do Well,Merriwether Williams,twilight sparkle,"What we're trying to say is, it's great to be really good at something, but it's important to act with grace and humility."
The Mysterious Mare Do Well,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,Ohhhh. That makes loads more sense. Yeah. You're right. And I guess I should've also acted with grace and humility when others outshine me. Like Mare Do Well.
The Mysterious Mare Do Well,Merriwether Williams,twilight sparkle,Sounds like you've got a letter to write to Princess Celestia.
The Mysterious Mare Do Well,Merriwether Williams,spike,"Already got it covered. As your ghost writer, I've already penned a letter to the Princess."
The Mysterious Mare Do Well,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,"That's nice of you, Spike, but I really wanna write this letter myself."
The Mysterious Mare Do Well,Merriwether Williams,spike,"Aww, come on, I wrote the whole thing already!"
The Mysterious Mare Do Well,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,"Okay, let's hear it."
The Mysterious Mare Do Well,Merriwether Williams,spike,[clears throat] Dear Princess Cel-
The Mysterious Mare Do Well,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,Look out! It's a real ghost!
Sweet and Elite,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,[gasp] Here? I get to stay here?
Sweet and Elite,Meghan McCarthy,princess celestia,"Twilight Sparkle said you were coming to Canterlot for a visit, and asked if I might accommodate you."
Sweet and Elite,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"Thank you so much, Princess."
Sweet and Elite,Meghan McCarthy,princess celestia,You're very welcome.
Sweet and Elite,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"No, really. This is so nice of you."
Sweet and Elite,Meghan McCarthy,princess celestia,"It's nothing, really."
Sweet and Elite,Meghan McCarthy,princess celestia,You are very we<U+0096>
Sweet and Elite,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,Thank you!
Sweet and Elite,Meghan McCarthy,princess celestia,I'll leave you to get settled.
Sweet and Elite,Meghan McCarthy,princess celestia,Enjoy your stay.
Sweet and Elite,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,Thank you!
Sweet and Elite,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,That's perfect.
Sweet and Elite,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"Oh, this old thing? Oh, it's just something I<U+0096>"
Sweet and Elite,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"Oh, yes, of course... how are you?"
Sweet and Elite,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"Well, yeah, yes, but<U+0096>"
Sweet and Elite,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"""Looked a little country"". ""Not something you can get in Canterlot"". I'll show you something worthy of Canterlot!"
Sweet and Elite,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"[panting] I have to get started right away. This new design is very ambitious, and I've already written to Twilight to let her know she'll have something beyond fabulous to wear to her party. [gasps] Fancy Pants!"
Sweet and Elite,Meghan McCarthy,fancy pants,"I say, that's one way to make an introduction."
Sweet and Elite,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"Oh, goodness, I am so sorry. I didn't see you there. I've just got so many bags and I was trying to get back to my suite at the castle and<U+0096>"
Sweet and Elite,Meghan McCarthy,fancy pants,You're staying at the castle?
Sweet and Elite,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,Wh<U+0096> The Princess invited me to stay in one of the suites.
Sweet and Elite,Meghan McCarthy,fancy pants,You know the Princess?
Sweet and Elite,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"Oh, it's for an ensemble I'm making for a friend. Her birthday is in a few days. [pants] Again, I am really sorry I bumped into you."
Sweet and Elite,Meghan McCarthy,fancy pants,"I'm not! Heheh, you are obviously somepony worth bumping into! Listen, I have a VIP box reserved at the Wonderbolts Derby this afternoon. Would you, would you be so kind as to join me and a few of my companions there?"
Sweet and Elite,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,Me?
Sweet and Elite,Meghan McCarthy,fancy pants,"But of course, my dear."
Sweet and Elite,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"Well, I'm, uh, ah- no- sure."
Sweet and Elite,Meghan McCarthy,fancy pants,"We'd love to see you there, uh...?"
Sweet and Elite,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,Rarity.
Sweet and Elite,Meghan McCarthy,fancy pants,Rarity.
Sweet and Elite,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"Pardon me. 'Scuse me, 'scuse me!"
Sweet and Elite,Meghan McCarthy,fancy pants,"Rarity, jolly good to see you! So glad you could make it."
Sweet and Elite,Meghan McCarthy,fancy pants,"Everypony, this is Rarity. She's staying at Canterlot Castle."
Sweet and Elite,Meghan McCarthy,fancy pants,"I'll be rooting for Rapidfire, of course. He's sure to take home the grand prize."
Sweet and Elite,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,I don't think he has a chance against Fleetfoot.
Sweet and Elite,Meghan McCarthy,fancy pants,"Bravo, Rarity! I say, how did you know Fleetfoot would be victorious?"
Sweet and Elite,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"My friend Rainbow Dash talks about her all the time. She says what Fleetfoot lacks in size, she makes up for in speed."
Sweet and Elite,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"Uh... [gulps] Why... she's... she's the... the Wonderbolts' trainer, of course."
Sweet and Elite,Meghan McCarthy,fancy pants,"Staying at Canterlot Castle, and she knows the Pegasus training the Wonderbolts. I told you all this was an important pony."
Sweet and Elite,Meghan McCarthy,fancy pants,"Three cheers for Rarity, my new favorite party guest!"
Sweet and Elite,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"...And then I said, ""Puh-lease, that isn't a hat, darling, that's a natural disaster that somehow landed atop your head!"""
Sweet and Elite,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"Oh, I'd love to, but I<U+0096>"
Sweet and Elite,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"Well, that sounds wonderful, but I<U+0096>"
Sweet and Elite,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"I'm flattered, really. It's just I have a project I really need to get started on, and-"
Sweet and Elite,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,...of course I'll be there.
Sweet and Elite,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"Looks like we'll be spending a few more days here, Opalescence. Turns out bumping into Fancy Pants like that was the best thing that's ever happened to me. Of course, finishing Twilight's dress in time for her birthday party is still my top priority, but I can't possibly disappoint the Canterlot elite by rejecting their invitations now, can I?"
Sweet and Elite,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"I'll be the toast of the town, the girl on the go I'm the type of pony every pony, every pony should know I'll be the one to watch, the girl in the flow I'm the type of pony every pony, every pony should know"
Sweet and Elite,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"Oh, I hope I haven't forgotten anything."
Sweet and Elite,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,We'd better get going.
Sweet and Elite,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,I must get back to Ponyville with enough time to finish Twilight's ensemble.
Sweet and Elite,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"For me? Dearest Rarity, your presence is requested at the Canterlot garden party tomorrow afternoon. Yours, Jet Set and Upper Crust! [gasps] The Canterlot garden party! Why, next to the Galloping Gala that is the premier event in Canterlot! [squeals] Oh, but if I go, I'll miss Twilight's birthday... But if I don't go, my new reputation in Canterlot as a Very Important Pony might be ruined! I might never be invited to another high society event again! Friend's birthday... Very Important Pony... [winces] It's just too important. [takes deep breath] My dear Twilight, I am afraid I won't be able to make it to your birthday party tomorrow, because... because poor Opal is quite ill, and she is in no condition to make the long journey back to Ponyville! I do hope you understand. Your friend, Rarity."
Sweet and Elite,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"No. But, I will need some help unpacking them."
Sweet and Elite,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"What do you think? Too much? You're right. Too little. Ah, garden party, here I come!"
Sweet and Elite,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,"[fades in] Swoosh! And right before she hit the ground, shoom, she<U+0096> Hi again!"
Sweet and Elite,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,What are you<U+0096> how did you<U+0096> Why are you<U+0096>
Sweet and Elite,Meghan McCarthy,applejack,"Listen to her. She's so excited to see us, she can hardly talk."
Sweet and Elite,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"What I mean to say is, what are you all doing here?"
Sweet and Elite,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"When I got your letter saying you were stuck in Canterlot, I asked Pinkie Pie if it wouldn't be too much trouble to move my birthday party here, so you wouldn't have to miss it!"
Sweet and Elite,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,Balloons are super easy to pack.
Sweet and Elite,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"Wow... First you get me a suite at Canterlot Castle and now this. I don't know what to say, Twilight."
Sweet and Elite,Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,How about you start by saying what you're doing in that fancy getup?
Sweet and Elite,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,"Oh, poor Opal. Where is the sick darling?"
Sweet and Elite,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"Oh, uhh, she's... Hold on a minute."
Sweet and Elite,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,I am so sorry about this.
Sweet and Elite,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,She's resting on the bed.
Sweet and Elite,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,Poor baby.
Sweet and Elite,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,She looks awful.
Sweet and Elite,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Is... that my dress?
Sweet and Elite,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,Yes.
Sweet and Elite,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,It's so... simple. So practical. So me! It's the perfect dress for my birthday party! I love it!
Sweet and Elite,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,[sighs in relief] You don't know how glad I am to hear you say that.
Sweet and Elite,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"When I told the Princess that I was moving the party to Canterlot, she was kind enough to offer us the Canterlot Castle ballroom!"
Sweet and Elite,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,Isn't it fancy pants?
Sweet and Elite,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,"Oh, I never leave home without my party cannon!"
Sweet and Elite,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,Ta-da!
Sweet and Elite,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"I thought about having my birthday outside, but they're having another party on the castle grounds today."
Sweet and Elite,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,Let's party!
Sweet and Elite,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,Mmh... No reason I can't at least make an appearance...
Sweet and Elite,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,I'm here!
Sweet and Elite,Meghan McCarthy,fancy pants,Rarity! So happy to see you here.
Sweet and Elite,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,I wouldn't have missed this for the world.
Sweet and Elite,Meghan McCarthy,fancy pants,"[sniffs] I say, what is that scent you're wearing? It smells like... [sniffs] Is that cake frosting?"
Sweet and Elite,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"...Yes, I always dab a little frosting behind my ears before I go out. [laughs nervously] After all, who doesn't like the smell of cake frosting?"
Sweet and Elite,Meghan McCarthy,fancy pants,I know I do.
Sweet and Elite,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"[sighs] Well, all this talk about cake has made me hungry. Think I'll go and see what's on the hors d'oeuvre table. If you'll excuse me..."
Sweet and Elite,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,I think I left the bathwater running in my suite.
Sweet and Elite,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,I really should go check on Opal...
Sweet and Elite,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,Is that Princess Celestia?
Sweet and Elite,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,[hushed] I need to use the little fillies' room!
Sweet and Elite,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,Can I get anypony more punch?
Sweet and Elite,Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,"Uh, what's with the croquet mallet?"
Sweet and Elite,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,[muffled] What croquet mallet?
Sweet and Elite,Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,"Duh, the one in your mouth!"
Sweet and Elite,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"[laughs nervously] Ooh, that croquet mallet. I- well I, you know, the truth is... the truth is..."
Sweet and Elite,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Were you at that other party in the garden?
Sweet and Elite,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"I, I..."
Sweet and Elite,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"Rarity, I'm surprised at you."
Sweet and Elite,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,Twilight let me explain! I<U+0096>
Sweet and Elite,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,I hadn't realized you were such a savvy businesspony!
Sweet and Elite,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,You must understand! I<U+0096>
Sweet and Elite,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"All of those ponies look so posh. And with the Grand Galloping Gala coming up, I bet you could totally get some of them to buy your dresses. Very smart!"
Sweet and Elite,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"Oh, well, you didn't have to do that. You should totally go over there and mingle!"
Sweet and Elite,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"Twilight, you really are the best friend a pony could ever ask for. I don't know why I ever thought you wouldn't understand."
Sweet and Elite,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Understand what?
Sweet and Elite,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,Nothing. See you girls later!
Sweet and Elite,Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,"Hey, wait up! We're your friends! I'm sure they won't mind if we check out the party too! C'mon, you guys! Let's show them how to party Ponyville style!"
Sweet and Elite,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,Oh no!
Sweet and Elite,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,Mmm!
Sweet and Elite,Meghan McCarthy,applejack,"How come y'all aren't doing any gardening? This is a garden party, isn't it?"
Sweet and Elite,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,[nervous laugh] Yeah.
Sweet and Elite,Meghan McCarthy,fancy pants,"Excuse me, might I ask where you got your ensemble?"
Sweet and Elite,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"Why, yes! Yes, you may. A very, very close friend of mine from Ponyville made it for me."
Sweet and Elite,Meghan McCarthy,fancy pants,Ponyville? You don't say?
Sweet and Elite,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,I do say. Her name is<U+0096>
Sweet and Elite,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"Fancy Pants! Come with me! I'd like to show you this, er, thing that's over there. On the other side of the room."
Sweet and Elite,Meghan McCarthy,fancy pants,"In a moment, my dear. This lovely filly from Ponyville was just about to tell me who made her charming dress."
Sweet and Elite,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"That dress? Oh come now, who cares, it's just a plain old<U+0096>"
Sweet and Elite,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"Oh, don't be so modest! This dress you made is beautiful!"
Sweet and Elite,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,We all think so!
Sweet and Elite,Meghan McCarthy,fancy pants,[to Rarity] You know these ponies?
Sweet and Elite,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"Yes. Yes, I do know them. They may not be as sophisticated as some of you Canterlot ponies, but they are my best friends. And they are without a doubt the most important ponies I know."
Sweet and Elite,Meghan McCarthy,fancy pants,"I, for one, find them charmingly rustic."
Sweet and Elite,Meghan McCarthy,fancy pants,And I think the dress you made for your friend is lovely. [chuckle] I dare say every mare in Canterlot will be wanting one.
Sweet and Elite,Meghan McCarthy,fancy pants,"Er, yes, now then. How about you introduce me to your friends?"
Sweet and Elite,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,With pleasure!
Sweet and Elite,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"Dear Princess Celestia,"
Sweet and Elite,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,I wanted to tell you about the important lesson I learned during my visit.
Sweet and Elite,Meghan McCarthy,princess celestia,Now that I would like to hear.
Sweet and Elite,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"I learned that no matter where you go in life, you should never forget that you are the product of your home and your friends. And that is something always to be proud of, no matter what."
Sweet and Elite,Meghan McCarthy,princess celestia,"Hm, a very valuable lesson to have learned."
Secret of My Excess,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"No distractions. Today is too important. Re-shelving day! Understanding Medieval Equestria goes in Pony History. Modern Spellcasting. That's Classics. The Art of the To-Do List... Actually, I kinda wanna read that again."
Secret of My Excess,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,Spike! What are you laughing at?
Secret of My Excess,M. A. Larson,spike,"This little beauty is my birthday present to myself! It's a fire ruby! I've been aging it for months, and it's almost ripe!"
Secret of My Excess,M. A. Larson,spike,"[giggles] Hey, you took my advice! Just use the whole floor as one big shelf."
Secret of My Excess,M. A. Larson,rarity,"[muffled] Hellooo? [normal] Anypony home? Twilight? [gasps] Is that a fire ruby?! Huh, that must be at least twenty carats! No inclusions, pristine facets..."
Secret of My Excess,M. A. Larson,spike,And totally delicious.
Secret of My Excess,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,Uhh... if you guys don't mind?
Secret of My Excess,M. A. Larson,rarity,"Oh, uh, of course. I just came by to see if you had any books on historical fashion... [to Spike] Did you say... delicious?"
Secret of My Excess,M. A. Larson,spike,"Sure did! Next week's my birthday, and this is my birthday dinner."
Secret of My Excess,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,Start with this one.
Secret of My Excess,M. A. Larson,rarity,"Thanks, Twilight. I've got a feeling ruffled taffeta capes are going to make a huge comeback this season, and I want to be ahead of the game... [to Spike] I hope it's as tasty as it is beautiful, Spike. I've never seen anything quite so stunning before."
Secret of My Excess,M. A. Larson,spike,"Gosh... You really like it, huh?"
Secret of My Excess,M. A. Larson,rarity,Like it? It's magnificent.
Secret of My Excess,M. A. Larson,spike,[sighs] Then you should have it. This beautiful gem was meant to be with you.
Secret of My Excess,M. A. Larson,rarity,"I don't know what to say... This is so thoughtful. Oh, my little Spikey-wikey! [kisses] Thank you so much!"
Secret of My Excess,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Wow, Spike, that's one of the kindest, most generous things you've ever done. I've never seen Rarity so happy!"
Secret of My Excess,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Just about finished, Spike? Everypony will be here soon."
Secret of My Excess,M. A. Larson,spike,There. Perfect! Everything looks perfect!
Secret of My Excess,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,Not quite everything.
Secret of My Excess,M. A. Larson,spike,"A washcloth? I don't get it. Ah, no way, Twilight! I said I wasn't gonna wash the cheek that Rarity kissed, and I meant it!"
Secret of My Excess,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"It's over, Spike! I'm cleaning that cheek!"
Secret of My Excess,M. A. Larson,spike,[gasps for breath] It's mine! Stop it!
Secret of My Excess,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,Never!
Secret of My Excess,M. A. Larson,spike,Twilight...!
Secret of My Excess,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,[blows party hooter] Happy birthday!
Secret of My Excess,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,"Party time, woo-hoo!"
Secret of My Excess,M. A. Larson,spike,Are those... for me?
Secret of My Excess,M. A. Larson,applejack,"You bet they are, birthday boy."
Secret of My Excess,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,"Happy birthday, Spike."
Secret of My Excess,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,Don't you know you get presents on your birthday?
Secret of My Excess,M. A. Larson,spike,"Well, actually, this is my first birthday in Ponyville... I usually just get one present... from Twilight. A book."
Secret of My Excess,M. A. Larson,rarity,"Speaking of presents, this is from my new line of taffeta capes. I'm going to make one for each of you!"
Secret of My Excess,M. A. Larson,rarity,"I've been inspired by the generosity of my little Spikey-wikey, who gave me this beautiful fire ruby, one of the kindest acts I've ever experienced. Mmm."
Secret of My Excess,M. A. Larson,spike,"Applejack, I can't thank you enough for this great blanket. I really needed a new one."
Secret of My Excess,M. A. Larson,applejack,"C'mon, Spike, you already thanked me fifteen times. I'm startin' to get a little embarrassed."
Secret of My Excess,M. A. Larson,spike,"I know I keep thanking you guys, but I'm just so grateful. I wish this party could last forever."
Secret of My Excess,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,"Duh! The party can't last forever 'cause you have to go to Sugarcube Corner, 'cause the Cakes said they have a special surprise for you, 'cause it's your birthday!"
Secret of My Excess,M. A. Larson,spike,No way!
Secret of My Excess,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,"I said the party couldn't last forever, but it doesn't need to end right now!"
Secret of My Excess,M. A. Larson,spike,"Hi, Mr. and Mrs. Cake!"
Secret of My Excess,M. A. Larson,mr. cake,"Mr. There's the dragon of the hour! Happy birthday, Spike!"
Secret of My Excess,M. A. Larson,spike,Thanks!
Secret of My Excess,M. A. Larson,mrs. cake,"Mrs. When we found out it was your birthday, we couldn't resist trying out a new recipe: sapphire!"
Secret of My Excess,M. A. Larson,spike,Wow!
Secret of My Excess,M. A. Larson,spike,"Thank you so much! Man, first I get a bunch of great presents from my best friends, and now an amazing sapphire cupcake! Hohoh, what a day! Whoa! Oh my gosh! I'm so sorry, Cheerilee!"
Secret of My Excess,M. A. Larson,cheerilee,That's okay. What's got you so excited?
Secret of My Excess,M. A. Larson,spike,"[chomps] [muffled] Pinkie Pie told me I should come see the Cakes, so they could give me a cake 'cause it's my birthday today."
Secret of My Excess,M. A. Larson,cheerilee,"Well, happy birthday, Spike! I wish I had something to give you! Uh... Oh! Here you go!"
Secret of My Excess,M. A. Larson,spike,"Wow, really?"
Secret of My Excess,M. A. Larson,cheerilee,"Sure! Everypony should get fun gifts on their birthday! Have a great birthday, Spike."
Secret of My Excess,M. A. Larson,spike,I wish every day was my birthday...
Secret of My Excess,M. A. Larson,spike,"Pinkie Pie mentions my birthday to the Cakes, and I get a cupcake. I mention it to Cheerilee, and I get this great hat."
Secret of My Excess,M. A. Larson,spike,"Hmmm, I wonder... Hey there, Lickety Split! That's a pretty cool ball you got there! Did you know it's my birthday?"
Secret of My Excess,M. A. Larson,spike,"[laughs] This is unbelievable! [chuckles] Hey, Junebug! It's my birthday!"
Secret of My Excess,M. A. Larson,spike,"Aren't you gonna give me something? You know, like a birthday present?"
Secret of My Excess,M. A. Larson,spike,"Well, how about those flowers? I'll take those<U+0096>"
Secret of My Excess,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Spike! Uh, sorry, Junebug, I think Spike might've gotten a little carried away."
Secret of My Excess,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,What are you doing? You're out here demanding gifts now?
Secret of My Excess,M. A. Larson,spike,"Wow, you're right, Twilight. I don't know what got into me. Thanks for snapping me out of it. I'd better go give Cheerilee her hat back."
Secret of My Excess,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,No problem. See you at home later?
Secret of My Excess,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Wow, what a rough night's sleep, Spike. I had the weirdest drea<U+0096>"
Secret of My Excess,M. A. Larson,spike,[yawns/hisses] What happened?
Secret of My Excess,M. A. Larson,spike,"What's happening to me, Twilight?!"
Secret of My Excess,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,I don't know! Think back to last night. Did something happen? Spike? What did you do after I saw you?
Secret of My Excess,M. A. Larson,spike,I went to talk... to...
Secret of My Excess,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,Spike!
Secret of My Excess,M. A. Larson,spike,Huh?
Secret of My Excess,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,You went to talk to who?
Secret of My Excess,M. A. Larson,spike,"Oh, um... I don't remember. Hey, can I have that globe? You're not using it, right?"
Secret of My Excess,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,Huh?
Secret of My Excess,M. A. Larson,spike,What about this book?
Secret of My Excess,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Spike, I'm worried about you. You're usually not so... grabby!"
Secret of My Excess,M. A. Larson,spike,My arms aren't usually [voice drops] this long either. What's happening to me?
Secret of My Excess,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,This is Spike. [slaps] And something's wrong with him. [slaps] He used to be half this size! And he keeps trying to take things that aren't [slaps] his!
Secret of My Excess,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"So? What do you think, Doctor?"
Secret of My Excess,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,That's not the problem. He's always been a dragon.
Secret of My Excess,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"[sighs] Okay. Thank you, doctor."
Secret of My Excess,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Thanks anyway. C'mon, Spike."
Secret of My Excess,M. A. Larson,zecora,"Ooh, he is starting to mature. Of this fact I am quite sure."
Secret of My Excess,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,Mature? So he's just... growing up? But that doesn't explain why he keeps grabbing things.
Secret of My Excess,M. A. Larson,zecora,"A dragon's heart is prone to greed, a steady diet to make growth speed. Then, the resulting bigger size only makes their hunger rise. If this trait should go unchecked, if Spike continues to collect, more growth will certainly occur <U+0096> he is going to turn into a monster."
Secret of My Excess,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"[gasps] You mean the more things a dragon collects, the bigger and greedier he gets? But how do we stop him before he's completely out of control?"
Secret of My Excess,M. A. Larson,zecora,"If his monstrous ways you wish to impede, you must prevent him from practicing greed."
Secret of My Excess,M. A. Larson,apple bloom,"Get away from her, you brute!"
Secret of My Excess,M. A. Larson,spike,Spike want!
Secret of My Excess,M. A. Larson,scootaloo,You're not getting my scooter!
Secret of My Excess,M. A. Larson,spike,Spike want!
Secret of My Excess,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Hey, Spike! Check out this amazing broom!"
Secret of My Excess,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"[sing-song voice] C'mon, big boy! Look at this incredible broom!"
Secret of My Excess,M. A. Larson,spike,Spike want!
Secret of My Excess,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Fight all you want, I'm not letting you out! Oh, Spike, I just re-shelved this room!"
Secret of My Excess,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,[groans] What now?
Secret of My Excess,M. A. Larson,applejack,"Now who in Ponyville would steal my apples? For that matter, who would steal my leaves?"
Secret of My Excess,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Applejack, help! Spike's running wild and I need you to lasso him!"
Secret of My Excess,M. A. Larson,applejack,"[laughs] Oh, that's a good one, Twilight. Sweet little Spike, running wild. Ha, what a laugh."
Secret of My Excess,M. A. Larson,applejack,"Twilight, get my rope."
Secret of My Excess,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,Huh? [laughs] Don't tell me! You-you tied yourselves up?
Secret of My Excess,M. A. Larson,applejack,Get us out of here right now!
Secret of My Excess,M. A. Larson,applejack,[gasps] What was that?
Secret of My Excess,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,Sounded like Fluttershy to me!
Secret of My Excess,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,Fluttershy? Fluttershy!?
Secret of My Excess,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,I'm up here!
Secret of My Excess,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,What happened?
Secret of My Excess,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,"I was helping my squirrel friends with a dance step, and all of a sudden, a giant, r-rampaging d-d-d-dragon stormed through!"
Secret of My Excess,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,That was Spike!
Secret of My Excess,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,Spike? But why would Spike steal my chicken coop? He just pulled it out of the ground and filled it with a bunch of apples and stuff!
Secret of My Excess,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,That sounded like Pinkie Pie!
Secret of My Excess,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"C'mon, girls!"
Secret of My Excess,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,Back! Get back!
Secret of My Excess,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,Pinkie Pie! Stop giving him cake!
Secret of My Excess,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,"I'm not giving him cake, I'm assaulting him with cake!"
Secret of My Excess,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,How dare you take the cake!
Secret of My Excess,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,He's completely out of control! Who knows where he'll go next!
Secret of My Excess,M. A. Larson,rarity,"Put me down, you brute!"
Secret of My Excess,M. A. Larson,rarity,How rude.
Secret of My Excess,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,"Don't worry Rarity, we'll save you!"
Secret of My Excess,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,"Put her down, right now!"
Secret of My Excess,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,"I-If you wouldn't mind, that is..."
Secret of My Excess,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,"I mean it, dragon boy!"
Secret of My Excess,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,We'll be ever so grateful if you'd be so kind as to possibly consider...
Secret of My Excess,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,"Drop her, scaly!"
Secret of My Excess,M. A. Larson,rarity,Hey! I'm<U+0096> not some<U+0096> sort of common<U+0096> fly swatter!
Secret of My Excess,M. A. Larson,rarity,Girls! My cape!
Secret of My Excess,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,Look! The Wonderbolts!
Secret of My Excess,M. A. Larson,rarity,"Oh, be quiet. You've got nothing to be proud of. You steal everypony's things, terrorize the town, and use me as a weapon against my own friends! Which, as horrible as it is, I can almost understand because you're a dragon and all. But this! [rips off dress] This is a crime against fashion! Oh no. You are not getting this gemstone! This was given to me by my dear friend Spikey-wikey, the kindest, sweetest, most generous dragon ever. And it is too precious to me to give to a greedy old beast like you!"
Secret of My Excess,M. A. Larson,rarity,"Oh, what now? I suppose you'll be eating me or something? Spike?! You're the rampaging dragon?!"
Secret of My Excess,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,Somepony do something!
Secret of My Excess,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,On it!
Secret of My Excess,M. A. Larson,spike,Rarity? I need to tell you something! Just in case we don't make it! I've always sort of had a crush<U+0096>
Secret of My Excess,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,[gasps] We did it! I can't believe we did it!
Secret of My Excess,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,All in a day's work.
Secret of My Excess,M. A. Larson,rarity,"Spike, I just have to tell you how absolutely proud I am of you."
Secret of My Excess,M. A. Larson,spike,Proud of me?
Secret of My Excess,M. A. Larson,spike,"Dear Princess Celestia,"
Secret of My Excess,M. A. Larson,spike,"Today I learned a great lesson about friendship. Well, you might think that it would feel good to get lots and lots of stuff, but it doesn't feel nearly as good as giving something special to somepony you really care about. But I learned that it truly is better to give than to receive, and that kindness and generosity are what lead to true friendship. And that's more valuable than anything in the world. Well... almost anything."
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,twilight sparkle,We're getting closer!
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,I can hardly wait!
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,fluttershy,"I'm so excited, I-I feel like shouting! [softly] Woo-hoo!"
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,applejack,"Hooo-wee! Canterlot, here we come!"
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,rarity,"Oh, I do hope I look festive enough!"
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,pinkie pie,There it is! Canterlot!
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,twilight sparkle,"Oh, isn't Canterlot wonderful this time of year?"
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,"Yeah, I wish it was Hearth's Warming Eve every day."
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,applejack,There's so much to look at! I feel like my durned eyes are gonna pop right out of my head!
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,twilight sparkle,"I have an idea, let's play 'I spy with my little eye' as we walk! I'll go first. I spy... an eight-foot candy cane."
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,I spy a snowpony!
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,pinkie pie,I spy somepony eating a gingerbread house...
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,pinkie pie,[munching] ...and it's me!
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,twilight sparkle,I can't believe that Princess Celestia chose us to put on the most important play of the season! Do you guys know what an honor this is? For all of us?
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,fluttershy,"Oh, I wish she hadn't honored me quite so much... I can't go onstage! I don't want everypony looking at me!"
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,rarity,"Fluttershy, darling, there's nothing to feel nervous about."
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,fluttershy,No?
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,rarity,"Of course not. All across Equestria, ponies are preparing their own pageants for Hearth's Warming Eve in their own towns. It's tradition."
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,fluttershy,So you're saying they'll be too busy to come to our play?
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,rarity,"Well, no. We're in the Canterlot pageant, the biggest, most important production in all of Equestria. A lot of ponies will come to watch us."
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,fluttershy,A lot?
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,rarity,Hundreds.
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,fluttershy,Hundreds?
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,rarity,[gasps] Maybe even thousands!
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,rarity,"Oh, my hair! Applejack? Be a dear and shut those windows, will you?"
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,"Aaah! Rain-bow-Dash! Rain-bow-Dash! Aaaah! Thank you, thank you!"
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,applejack,It's a reenactment of the founding of Equestria. It's not the 'Rainbow Dash Show'.
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,Well it should be the 'Rainbow Dash Show'! I'm the star!
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,twilight sparkle,"Fluttershy, you've got to come out of there!"
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,spike,Curtain in two minutes!
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,pinkie pie,"Twilight, let me handle this."
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,rarity,My hair!
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,twilight sparkle,PINKIE!
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,applejack,The Hearth's Warming Eve pageant is about harmony and friendship.
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,spike,"[with a faux British accent] Once upon a time, long before the peaceful rule of Celestia, and before ponies discovered our beautiful land of Equestria, ponies did not know harmony. It was a strange and dark time. A time when ponies were torn apart... by hatred!"
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,spike,"[normal voice] I know. Can you believe it? [accent] During this frightful age, each of the three tribes <U+0096> the Pegasi, the unicorns, and the Earth ponies <U+0096> cared not for what befell the other tribes, but only for their own welfare. In those troubled times, as now, the Pegasi were the stewards of the weather. But they demanded something in return. Food that could only be grown by the Earth ponies."
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,spike,"The unicorns demanded the same, in return for magically bringing forth day and night. And so, mistrust between the tribes festered, until one fateful day, it came to a boil. And what prompted the ponies to clash? 'Twas a mysterious blizzard that overtook the land, and toppled the tribes' precarious peace."
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,spike,The normally industrious Earth ponies were unable to farm their land.
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,spike,"The Earth ponies were freezing. The home of the Pegasi fared no better. The Pegasi were hungry. And the unicorns were freezing and hungry. Even the unicorns' magic was powerless against the storm. Each tribe blamed the others for their suffering, and the angrier everypony grew, the worse the blizzard became. And so it was decided that a grand summit would be held to figure out a way to cope with the blizzard."
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,spike,Each tribe sent their leaders.
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,spike,"Daughter of the unicorn king, Princess Platinum."
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,spike,"Ruler of the Pegasi, Commander Hurricane. And lastly..."
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,spike,"...leader of the Earth ponies, Chancellor Puddinghead. Perhaps the three tribes could finally settle their differences, and agree on a way to get through this disaster."
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,All I wanna know is why the Earth ponies are hogging all the food!
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,pinkie pie,"Us?! We're not hogging all the food, you are! Oh, wait. You're right. It's us. Well, it's only 'cause you mean old Pegasusususes are making it snow like crazy!"
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,"For the hundredth time, it's not us! We're not making it snow! It must be the unicorns! They're doing it with their freaky magic!"
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,rarity,"[gasps] How dare you! Unlike you Pegasi ruffians, we unicorns would never stoop to such a thing! H-m-ph!"
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,pinkie pie,"Well, if you non-Earths aren't gonna stop using your weirdo powers to freeze us all, then I'm just plum out of ideas."
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,What a shocker. An Earth pony with no ideas.
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,rarity,"Commander Hurricane, please cease with the insults!"
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,"You're not the boss of me, your royal snootiness!"
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,rarity,I beg your pardon?! I am a princess! I won't be spoken to that way!
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,"Well, I'm leaving first!"
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,pinkie pie,"No, I'm first!"
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,spike,And the blizzard raged on.
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,spike,"So the summit of the tribes did not turn out as well as hoped, and the three leaders returned home to lick their wounds, and basically complain."
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,Atten-tion! Well? Aren't you curious about how it went?
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,fluttershy,"Oh! Commander Hurricane, sir! How did it go, sir?"
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,"Horribly! Those other tribe leaders are so disrespectful! Don't they realize that we are a mighty tribe of warriors, and should not be crossed? We have got to break ranks with those weak foals!"
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,rarity,[shivering] Clover the Clever! I need you!
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,twilight sparkle,"Yes, your Majesty. Did the other pony tribes see reason as I predicted?"
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,rarity,"Those other tribes are impossible! I, for one, can no longer bear to be anywhere near those lowly creatures. The unicorns are noble and majestic. We will no longer consort with the likes of them!"
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,applejack,"Wouldn't it have been easier to use the door, Chancellor?"
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,pinkie pie,"Maybe for you, Smart Cookie. But I am a chancellor. I was elected because I know how to think outside the box. Which means [slightly echoes] I can also think inside the chimney. Can you think inside a chimney?"
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,applejack,Uh...
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,pinkie pie,I didn't think so.
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,applejack,Ugh.
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,pinkie pie,Ohmygosh. Hold on to your hooves! I am just about to be brilliant!
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,applejack,[under her breath] That'd be a first.
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,pinkie pie,I have decided that the Earth ponies are gonna go it alone!
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,applejack,"Aw, so you mean the other tribes didn't come around? Shoot... I really thought we could get through to 'em if we<U+0096>"
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,pinkie pie,"Don't worry about them. We're the ones with all the food, right?"
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,applejack,"Actually, we're all out."
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,pinkie pie,"Fine, then we'll have to go somewhere new where we can grow some new food. And with me as our fearless leader, what could go wrong?"
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,applejack,[under her breath] Where should I start?
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,pinkie pie,The point is...
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,"C'mon, Private Pansy, let's get a move on! Hup-one, hup-two!"
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,"Get a hold of yourself, Private! We cannot let anything distract us from the mission at hand. To find, and if necessary, to conquer a new land!"
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,fluttershy,"Conquer, sir?"
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,You never know where enemies might be lurking.
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,fluttershy,"I don't see any enemies, Commander. Just... snow."
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,Okay. This is getting old.
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,rarity,"Oh, this is simply taking forever. My hooves are killing me! How long have we been walking for?"
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,twilight sparkle,"About five minutes, your highness."
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,rarity,"Oh, I never imagined finding a new land would be so hard. But it'll all be worth it, don't you agree?"
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,twilight sparkle,I actually think that the three tribes could've tried harder.
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,rarity,Stoooooop!
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,twilight sparkle,What's wrong?
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,rarity,That is what's wrong!
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,twilight sparkle,"Your Highness, it's just a stream. We can cross it easily."
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,rarity,"I refuse to get my gown wet. I have no intention of arriving at my new land looking like a bedraggled Earth pony, or worse yet a rough-and-tumble Pegasus. I, for one, have no intention of stooping down to their level. On the other hand, I have no trouble watching you stoop down."
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,rarity,"And do watch the gown, darling. It's worth more than all of the books in your library."
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,pinkie pie,"Yes, yes. This is definitely the right direction."
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,applejack,It feels like we're going in circles.
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,pinkie pie,But that's impossible. Are you suggesting that I'm reading the map wrong?
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,applejack,"Absolutely not, your chancellorness. It's just that there are holes in the map, and<U+0096>"
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,pinkie pie,Of course! How else could I see where I was going?
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,applejack,"Yeah, uh<U+0096>"
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,pinkie pie,"Or talk? I need to be able to talk! I mean, how would we survive if I just suddenly shut up?"
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,applejack,"Heaven forbid that should happen, your chancellorship. Heh. It's just that... the map is also upside down."
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,pinkie pie,"I got a newsflash for you, Cookie. The Earth is round. There is no up or down."
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,applejack,You're right! It's such a relief to me that you're in charge of this map...
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,pinkie pie,"Relief? You don't need relief! If anypony needs relief around here, it's me! I'm a chancellor! I'm a bigshot! You're just my, um... my, uh..."
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,applejack,Secretary.
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,pinkie pie,"Whatever. You take the map, while I enjoy some relief."
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,applejack,"Yes, Chancellor Puddinghead."
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,spike,"[accent] And so, each leader encountered obstacles along the way, but eventually, they all arrived in a new and wondrous land. Nopony had ever seen paradise before."
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,This is the new land we've been searching for!
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,fluttershy,What a view... I can see my future house from here.
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,I proclaim this new land to be... Pegasopolis!
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,rarity,"I've never seen such jewels! This ruby is dazzling. This whole land is dazzling. I'm double dazzled! [squeals] In the name of the unicorns, I hereby dub this land Unicornia!"
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,pinkie pie,The air! The trees! The dirt! This dirt is the dirtiest dirt in the whole dirt world!
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,applejack,"And fertile, too. Perfect for growing food."
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,pinkie pie,"In the name of the Earth ponies, I think I'm gonna call this new place... uh... Dirtville."
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,applejack,"How about ""Earth""?"
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,pinkie pie,Earth! Congratulations to me for thinking of it.
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,I planted my flag first!
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,rarity,Did not!
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,Did too!
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,pinkie pie,I planted mine earlier than first.
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,rarity,All of you riffraff are trespassing in Unicornia!
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,The name is Pegasopolis!
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,pinkie pie,Earth!
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,Pegasopolis!
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,rarity,Unicornia!
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,I say we fight for the land. May the best pony win!
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,rarity,That's barbaric. Clover the Clever? Throw that brute into the dungeon!
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,twilight sparkle,"What dungeon? Look, perhaps if we all calmed down..."
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,applejack,I agree. Let's all calm down.
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,fluttershy,I vote for calm.
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,"I'll have you court-martialed for insubordination, Private! We settle this on the battlefield!"
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,rarity,Who dares throw a snowball at royalty?!
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,pinkie pie,"Wait a minute, where'd all this snow come from anyway?"
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,Oh no. Not again.
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,spike,"[accent] And so the paradise that the ponies had found was soon lost, buried beneath a thick blanket of snow and hard feelings. Instead of beautiful, it was blizzardy. Instead of wonderful, it was wintry! Instead of spectacular, it was snow-tacular! Instead of<U+0096>"
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,spike,"[laughs nervously] [clears throat] [accent] Everypony was forced to seek shelter. They searched high and low, but the only shelter for miles was a cold and desolate cave. And, of course, the three tribes had to share it, and nopony was too happy about that."
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,rarity,"Please, Commander Hothead."
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,It's Commander Hurricane.
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,rarity,"[clears throat] Please, Commander, could you just stand back and give me my royal space?"
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,"You mean like this, your highness?"
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,rarity,Indeed not! You see this invisible line?
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,"Private? Outline our territory for everypony to see. See this real, non-invisible line? No unicorns or Earth ponies are allowed to cross it! This is the sovereign territory of Pegasopolis!"
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,rarity,Clover the Clever?
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,pinkie pie,Uh... Smart Cookie!
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,applejack,"I know, I know."
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,"What are you doing? Don't go around the rock, go over it! I'm not giving up an inch of territory to the enemy!"
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,rarity,"That rock is clearly on the Unicornia side of the cave, and it belongs to us! [under her breath] Who knows? there could be jewels inside."
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,[groans] I claim this rock for Pegasopolis!
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,rarity,"Unhand that rock this instant, you scoundrel!"
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,pinkie pie,"Oh, look, you found my rock. I've been looking for it everywhere."
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,Hey! You invaded our territory!
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,pinkie pie,"Finders keepers, losers weepers!"
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,That's the last straw!
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,rarity,Give me my rock!
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,twilight sparkle,"Look, everypony! The entrance!"
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,Great. Now there's no way out! We're trapped!
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,rarity,You two deserve this horrible fate. You've done nothing but argue and fight with each other!
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,"You've been fighting too, your Highness."
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,pinkie pie,Yeah! Worse! I haven't been fighting nearly as much as you!
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,rarity,How ridiculous! A unicorn never stoops to fighting!
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,That's just 'cause you wimpy unicorns know you'd never win! Earth ponies are numbskulls!
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,rarity,Pegasi are brutes!
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,pinkie pie,Unicorns are snobs!
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,fluttershy,W-W-What is that... thing?
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,twilight sparkle,They must be... windigos!
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,twilight sparkle,"My mentor Star Swirl the Bearded taught me about them. They're winter spirits that feed off fighting and hatred. The more hate the spirit feels, the colder things become!"
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,applejack,"Then... this is our fault. We three tribes... we brought this blizzard to our home by fightin' and not trustin' each other. Now it's destroyin' this land, too."
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,twilight sparkle,And now our bodies will become as cold as our hearts... all because we were foolish enough to hate.
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,fluttershy,"Well, I don't hate you... I actually hate Commander Hurricane a lot more than I hate you guys."
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,fluttershy,"Actually, I don't really hate her, I just really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really dislike her."
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,applejack,"Well, I don't hate you guys either."
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,twilight sparkle,Nor do I.
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,applejack,"No matter what our differences, we're all ponies."
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,fluttershy,What was that?
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,applejack,I didn't know unicorns could do that.
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,twilight sparkle,"I didn't either. Nothing like this has ever happened before. But I know it couldn't have been just me. It came from all three of us, joined together, in friendship."
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,spike,"[accent] All through the night, the three ponies kept the fire of friendship alive by telling stories to one another and by singing songs, which of course became the winter carols that we all still sing today. Eventually, the warmth of the fire and singing and laughing reached the leaders, and their bodies began to thaw. [normal voice] And it even began to melt their hearts."
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,spike,"[accent] The three leaders agreed to share the beautiful land, and live in harmony ever afterwards. And together, they named their new land..."
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,twilight sparkle,We should be so honored that Princess Celestia chose us! She must really think we exemplify what good friends are!
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,rarity,"Applejack, I thought you closed all the windows."
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,applejack,"Don't blame me. Rainbow Dash should've flown up there and shut it. After all, she's got wings."
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,Why do I always have to do all the high up chores? Why can't Twilight use her magic for a change!
Hearth's Warming Eve,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,Y'know what? I got it.
Family Appreciation Day,Cindy Morrow,granny smith,The timberwolves are a-howlin'! The timberwolves are a-howlin'!
Family Appreciation Day,Cindy Morrow,big mcintosh,Eeyup.
Family Appreciation Day,Cindy Morrow,granny smith,The zap apples are comin'! The zap apples are comin'!

Family Appreciation Day,Cindy Morrow,granny smith,[pause] Wait for what?
Family Appreciation Day,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,To make zap apple jam with you!
Family Appreciation Day,Cindy Morrow,granny smith,"O'course. Now I been doin' this ever since I was a little pony, so be warned, pickle pear. There's a whole mess o' steps in this process and you gots to get each one of them just right, or no zap apple jam. Take this."
Family Appreciation Day,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,"Uh, is this one of your gazillion secret herbal ingredients for the zap apple jam?"
Family Appreciation Day,Cindy Morrow,granny smith,"That there's a broom. Now get sweepin', pipsqueak! Now while you sweep, I'll get to, uh... something there... umm... Oh, ponyfeathers. Bet I'd forget my mane if it wasn't attached to my head."
Family Appreciation Day,Cindy Morrow,applejack,"There's the zap apple leaves, right on schedule!"
Family Appreciation Day,Cindy Morrow,granny smith,"A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L-M-N-O-P..."
Family Appreciation Day,Cindy Morrow,granny smith,"Well, howdy-doo there, Filthy Rich!"
Family Appreciation Day,Cindy Morrow,filthy rich,"Hello, Mrs. Smith. Did I hear right that there's a zap apple harvest coming in a few days?"
Family Appreciation Day,Cindy Morrow,granny smith,"Four days, to be exact."
Family Appreciation Day,Cindy Morrow,filthy rich,"Excellent news, and as usual, I get your first hundred jars?"
Family Appreciation Day,Cindy Morrow,granny smith,"'Course, Filthy."
Family Appreciation Day,Cindy Morrow,filthy rich,"Uh, I prefer Rich."
Family Appreciation Day,Cindy Morrow,granny smith,"Oh, and how is your pappy doin'?"
Family Appreciation Day,Cindy Morrow,diamond tiara,"Oh, you poor, poor thing, having to make all that zap apple jam with Granny Smith."
Family Appreciation Day,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,"Actually, I been looking forward to making zap apple jam for years!"
Family Appreciation Day,Cindy Morrow,diamond tiara,I'm not talking about the jam. I'm talking about Granny Smith! You must be sooo embarrassed.
Family Appreciation Day,Cindy Morrow,granny smith,[muffled] Soup's on!
Family Appreciation Day,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,"Uh, what do ya mean?"
Family Appreciation Day,Cindy Morrow,diamond tiara,"You know, with all her silly ways, how she forgets things, and makes you wear these ridiculous costumes?"
Family Appreciation Day,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,Granny said that the water needs<U+0096>
Family Appreciation Day,Cindy Morrow,diamond tiara,Thank goodness you're here on the farm and not in town where everypony could see you. [hushed] Don't worry. Your secret is safe with me.
Family Appreciation Day,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,"""Silly ways""?"
Family Appreciation Day,Cindy Morrow,granny smith,"Uh, thank you kindly, Filthy!"
Family Appreciation Day,Cindy Morrow,granny smith,"Oh, isn't this just precious?"
Family Appreciation Day,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,Please stop!
Family Appreciation Day,Cindy Morrow,granny smith,And it is perfect for makin' our zap apple jam!
Family Appreciation Day,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,"Shh! Stop it, Granny!"
Family Appreciation Day,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,"Granny, please! Those ponies over there are watchin' me!"
Family Appreciation Day,Cindy Morrow,granny smith,"What? Are those fillies your friends? Hello, Half-pint's friends!"
Family Appreciation Day,Cindy Morrow,silver spoon,"Hiii, Granny Smith! Hiii, [mockingly] Half-pint!"
Family Appreciation Day,Cindy Morrow,granny smith,"What dolls. Why, when I was little, ponies didn't come that purdy."
Family Appreciation Day,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,"Are we done shopping, Granny? 'Cause I'd like to get back to the farm, fast."
Family Appreciation Day,Cindy Morrow,granny smith,"All done, smellybelly. [singing] I got my honey, gooey-goo! Got my honey, gooey-ooh! Got my honey, iddley-hoo!"
Family Appreciation Day,Cindy Morrow,filthy rich,"And, by capturing the whole sale market, purchasing in bulk and slashing all prices, we undermine every other gift market in town, and that's how Rich's Barnyard Bargains became the cornerstone of retail in Ponyville."
Family Appreciation Day,Cindy Morrow,cheerilee,"Well, thank you, Mr. Filthy<U+0097>I mean, Mr. Rich. What a wonderful day of sharing! And thank you for being a part of Family Appreciation Day! Now, uh, let's see who will be bringing in a family member for next Monday's Family Appreciation Day. Um... Oh! Apple Bloom!"
Family Appreciation Day,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,"But Miss Cheerilee. Monday is zap apple harvest day, and Applejack and Big McIntosh will be too busy to come and speak."
Family Appreciation Day,Cindy Morrow,cheerilee,"Well, is there anypony else in your family that could<U+0096>"
Family Appreciation Day,Cindy Morrow,diamond tiara,Miss Cheerilee. Apple Bloom's Granny Smith isn't working harvest. She could come.
Family Appreciation Day,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,"Oh! But, uh, no, that wouldn't<U+0096>"
Family Appreciation Day,Cindy Morrow,cheerilee,"That's a splendid idea, Diamond Tiara! Apple Bloom, you shall bring in Granny Smith on Monday."
Family Appreciation Day,Cindy Morrow,cheerilee,"Have a great weekend, everypony!"
Family Appreciation Day,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,"Granny Smith? Come Monday, I'll be the laughin' stock of Ponyville!"
Family Appreciation Day,Cindy Morrow,applejack,"I'm sorry, Apple Bloom. I already told you that we just can't take a break from harvest to come to your school. You know what'll happen."
Family Appreciation Day,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,"I know... After the fifth day, the zap apples disappear..."
Family Appreciation Day,Cindy Morrow,granny smith,Look! The third sign! Right on time! Hot diggity!
Family Appreciation Day,Cindy Morrow,granny smith,"Alright, you lazy daisies, move your caboose!"
Family Appreciation Day,Cindy Morrow,applejack,"I'm sorry, Apple Bloom, but don't you fret. Granny Smith's got no shortage of entertainin' stories to tell."
Family Appreciation Day,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,I know. That's what I'm worried about.
Family Appreciation Day,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,"I'll be embarrassed, shamed, disgraced, mortified, humiliate<U+0096>"
Family Appreciation Day,Cindy Morrow,scootaloo,"What are you, a dictionary?"
Family Appreciation Day,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,Snap out of it. We're here to help you!
Family Appreciation Day,Cindy Morrow,scootaloo,"After all, we are the Cutie Mark Crusaders. We'll figure out a way to postpone your presentation."
Family Appreciation Day,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,But how? Ugh! All this worry is makin' me sick!
Family Appreciation Day,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,Sick?
Family Appreciation Day,Cindy Morrow,scootaloo,That's it! C'mon!
Family Appreciation Day,Cindy Morrow,granny smith,"Ten-hut! Now listen here, troops! Now, I don't want any whinin' or cryin' or crackin' under pressure! Do I make myself clear!?"
Family Appreciation Day,Cindy Morrow,granny smith,Court-martialed!
Family Appreciation Day,Cindy Morrow,scootaloo,"Stay still, Apple Bloom! You have to look sick!"
Family Appreciation Day,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,"Aaah! [muffled] Hey, this is hot!"
Family Appreciation Day,Cindy Morrow,granny smith,"What in the hayseed is going on in there, silly billy?"
Family Appreciation Day,Cindy Morrow,scootaloo,"Oh, Granny Smith! We were just about to come get you!"
Family Appreciation Day,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,Apple Bloom's sick! Looks like she might have to stay home all week!
Family Appreciation Day,Cindy Morrow,granny smith,[mumbles] Ooh! Perfect as a Piccadilly pear!
Family Appreciation Day,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,Now what?
Family Appreciation Day,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,"It's already almost sundown! Tomorrow is Sunday, and I only have one more day to figure something out!"
Family Appreciation Day,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,Hey! Look!
Family Appreciation Day,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,That's the fourth sign!
Family Appreciation Day,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,The zap apples have appeared!
Family Appreciation Day,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,And that gives me an idea!
Family Appreciation Day,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,"We can't move Family Appreciation Day, so let's move harvest day instead!"
Family Appreciation Day,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,They don't look... quite ripe.
Family Appreciation Day,Cindy Morrow,scootaloo,Harvesting apples early never hurt an apple.
Family Appreciation Day,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,I don't know... Zap apple trees aren't like normal apple trees. They're magic.
Family Appreciation Day,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,How different can they be?
Family Appreciation Day,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,"Well if we can't buck 'em, let's just pick 'em!"
Family Appreciation Day,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,Any other bright ideas?
Family Appreciation Day,Cindy Morrow,cheerilee,"Granny Smith, it's Miss Cheerilee! Apple Bloom said you wanted to speak with me?... Hello? Granny Smi<U+0096>"
Family Appreciation Day,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,[mimicking Granny Smith] Well hello there! Howdydoo!
Family Appreciation Day,Cindy Morrow,cheerilee,"Hi... uh... Granny Smith... is, ugh, everything okay?"
Family Appreciation Day,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,[mimicking Granny Smith] Of course it is! Why wouldn't it be?
Family Appreciation Day,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,"[mimicking Granny Smith] Oh, er, excuse me. Uh, pickles always give me the hiccups! I need to tell you that I can't make the presentation on Monday after all!"
Family Appreciation Day,Cindy Morrow,cheerilee,"Oh no, is that so?"
Family Appreciation Day,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,"[mimicking Granny Smith] No doubts about it! I gotta shear the flowers and water the sheep! I mean, I have to water the flowers and shear the sheep!"
Family Appreciation Day,Cindy Morrow,cheerilee,"Oh, well, that's too bad. We can reschedule."
Family Appreciation Day,Cindy Morrow,granny smith,"E- whut- hai- where am I? Well, howdy, Miss Cheerilee! You window shopping?"
Family Appreciation Day,Cindy Morrow,cheerilee,Uh... no? You asked me to come here to tell me that you wouldn't be making it to Family Appreciation Day?
Family Appreciation Day,Cindy Morrow,granny smith,Fiddlesticks! I wouldn't miss it for all the tea in Canterlot!
Family Appreciation Day,Cindy Morrow,cheerilee,But- didn't you just say...?
Family Appreciation Day,Cindy Morrow,granny smith,See you Monday!
Family Appreciation Day,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,[sighs] I can't believe she woke up from her nap. She never wakes up from her nap! [muffled] I wish I could just run off and hide!
Family Appreciation Day,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,"Well, you can't run off... but maybe somepony else can!"
Family Appreciation Day,Cindy Morrow,granny smith,Yee-haw!
Family Appreciation Day,Cindy Morrow,applejack,The zap apple harvest has begun!
Family Appreciation Day,Cindy Morrow,granny smith,And tomorrow we will be makin' up some zap apple jam!
Family Appreciation Day,Cindy Morrow,scootaloo,[in deeper voice] Miss Granny Smith? Telegram.
Family Appreciation Day,Cindy Morrow,granny smith,"Well, bust my buttons. Uncle Apple Strudel wants me to pay him a visit."
Family Appreciation Day,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,And you can just make the 8AM train. I already packed you a bag!
Family Appreciation Day,Cindy Morrow,granny smith,"Well, that was considerate."
Family Appreciation Day,Cindy Morrow,granny smith,"But don't you worry, flibbertigibbet! I'll be back in time to make that jam!"
Family Appreciation Day,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,[sighs] That train ride takes all day. I'm safe. Hah.
Family Appreciation Day,Cindy Morrow,cheerilee,"For today's Family Appreciation Day, we are pleased to welcome Granny Smith. Um... Apple Bloom? Is Granny Smith here?"
Family Appreciation Day,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,"Oh, I'm sorry, Miss Cheerilee, but she got called out of town on account of a family emergency<U+0096>"
Family Appreciation Day,Cindy Morrow,granny smith,"Well, howdy, my little ponies!"
Family Appreciation Day,Cindy Morrow,granny smith,"Howdy, y'all! I'm as happy as a pig in a fresh mudpile to be here!"
Family Appreciation Day,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,Whuh- what are you doing here? Did you miss the train?
Family Appreciation Day,Cindy Morrow,granny smith,"Er, no, it came. And Uncle Apple Strudel was on it."
Family Appreciation Day,Cindy Morrow,diamond tiara,I can't wait to hear Granny Smith's presentation. [hushed] If she can remember any of it.
Family Appreciation Day,Cindy Morrow,granny smith,"Long ago, when I was a little pony, things were very different here in Ponyville, 'cause there was no Ponyville!"
Family Appreciation Day,Cindy Morrow,granny smith,"[voiceover] That's right, my little ponies. Me and my family were pilgrim pony folk, back when I was a little filly. Oh, we ventured far and wide, collecting new seeds and sellin' the old. But my pa was the finest seed collector in all of Equestria. Then, one day, the Smith family found themselves in the most brilliant, most grand, most magnificent of all cities. A place called... Canterlot. Well, I bet your hooves to hindquarters I had never seen anything like it before nor since. And as if the beauty of that city wasn't enough, suddenly, she appeared. Princess Celestia, the most regal of all ponies. When lo and behold, she stopped to look at my pa's seed collection. Then Princess Celestia saw that we were plumb-tuckered and hankerin' to find our forever home. And bein' a royal Princess and all, she knew exactly the place for us to lay down our stakes. My pa gave the Princess a mighty thanks. We quickly found that land near the Everfree Forest, and we built our first home. Next, we planted our first orchards. But an orchard don't grow overnight, and we were getting mighty short on food. Now mind you, we were cautioned about the forest, and we knew that it was not fit to enter."
Family Appreciation Day,Cindy Morrow,granny smith,"[voiceover] But I knew there was critters livin' there. There must be somethin' to eat. It was dark and musty, and I won't lie, it was scary. But every inch was covered in plant life, and before I knew it, wasn't I standin' in front of the most incredible apple trees! I had never seen anything that bore this kind of colorful fruit! Oh I started picking apples quick as a whip!"
Family Appreciation Day,Cindy Morrow,granny smith,"[voiceover] I turned, and there before me stood the timberwolves! I've never run so fast in my life. I did the only thing I could think of."
Family Appreciation Day,Cindy Morrow,granny smith,"[voiceover] My pa and I planted those special apple seeds, and before our eyes they grew like wildfire. Why, we had full grown trees faster than you could say 'lickety split'. Then each year, I paid close attention to the signs of the zap apples' special harvesting times. How the weather affects the Everfree Forest, how the timberwolves howl when the zap apples first start growing, and how they zapped away if you didn't pick 'em all in one day! And the fruits of our labor were the best fruit we ever tasted. Soon enough I was mixing up batches of zap apple jam. Just like harvestin' the zap apples had its special rules, so did makin' zap apple jam. I learned that you gotta be extra friendly with the bees, otherwise their honey won't taste rightly sweet to mix in with the zap apples. Who'd'a thought that glass jars needed talkin' to? Or that zap apples like pink polka dots? But magic is as magic does. Just funny that way. Then ponies started comin' to our farm from far and wide just to get a taste of my zap apple jam. Some of them decided to stay, like Stinkin' Rich, Diamond Tiara's great grandfather. Matter of fact, the first thing he ever sold was my zap apple jam."
Family Appreciation Day,Cindy Morrow,granny smith,"[voiceover] And before we knew it, we had ourselves a nice little town, bustling with all kinds of ponies. And that is how Ponyville was founded."
Family Appreciation Day,Cindy Morrow,granny smith,"Oh, thank you kindly, little ponies. Oh, now now, let's settle down."
Family Appreciation Day,Cindy Morrow,scootaloo,"So if it weren't for you and the zap apples, Ponyville wouldn't even exist?!"
Family Appreciation Day,Cindy Morrow,granny smith,"Darn tootin', little filly!"
Family Appreciation Day,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,"If it weren't for my Granny Smith, your daddy wouldn't have Barnyard Bargains."
Family Appreciation Day,Cindy Morrow,diamond tiara,But<U+0096>
Family Appreciation Day,Cindy Morrow,diamond tiara,But she's just a... kooky old lady!
Family Appreciation Day,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,She is not a kooky old lady! She is the most amazing pony in all of Ponyville!
Family Appreciation Day,Cindy Morrow,scootaloo,I think this is the best zap apple jam I've tasted yet!
Family Appreciation Day,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,"Must be 'cause you had something to do with it, Apple Bloom."
Family Appreciation Day,Cindy Morrow,granny smith,You betcha. Apple Bloom is one humdinger of a zap apple jammer!
Family Appreciation Day,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,I am?
Family Appreciation Day,Cindy Morrow,applejack,So I take it Family Appreciation Day went well?
Family Appreciation Day,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,Did it? My Granny Smith is super special! I just forgot that for a little while.
Family Appreciation Day,Cindy Morrow,granny smith,"Aw, don't fret. I forget things all the time. Now, I'll getcha... er... somethin'. Aw."
Family Appreciation Day,Cindy Morrow,applejack,Who wants to help Granny sing to the water?
Family Appreciation Day,Cindy Morrow,filthy rich,Diamond Tiara?
Family Appreciation Day,Cindy Morrow,diamond tiara,But dad!
Baby Cakes,Charlotte Fullerton,applejack,Can you believe the new baby is finally here?
Baby Cakes,Charlotte Fullerton,twilight sparkle,Cup Cake and Carrot Cake must be so proud!
Baby Cakes,Charlotte Fullerton,rarity,I wonder if it's a filly or a colt?

Baby Cakes,Charlotte Fullerton,rainbow dash,"Aw, yeah! Heh, just you wait! Once little Pound Cake there gets his wings going, he'll be all over the place."
Baby Cakes,Charlotte Fullerton,twilight sparkle,And be careful around Pumpkin Cake.
Baby Cakes,Charlotte Fullerton,rarity,Baby unicorns get strange magic surges that come and go.

Baby Cakes,Charlotte Fullerton,pinkie pie,"Happy month-i-versary to you and you today! [very quickly] I-can't-believe-you're-already-a-month-old. Time-sure-flies-doesn't-it-wow. Seems-like-only yesterday-you-were-born. But now you're a month old today, hey!"
Baby Cakes,Charlotte Fullerton,pinkie pie,Are you ready for your favoritest game in the whole wide world? Where's Pinkie Pie...? Here I am! Where's Pinkie Pie...? Here I am! Where's Pinkie Pie...? Here I am!

Baby Cakes,Charlotte Fullerton,pinkie pie,"I could do it! I wanna do it! Oh, the babies love playing with me, I'll do it!"
Baby Cakes,Charlotte Fullerton,mrs. cake,Mrs. I wonder who would be available on such short notice.
Baby Cakes,Charlotte Fullerton,pinkie pie,Me! Me! Pick me!

Baby Cakes,Charlotte Fullerton,mr. cake,"Mr. [groans] [unenthusiastically] Pinkie Pie, how would you like to babysit for us?"
Baby Cakes,Charlotte Fullerton,pinkie pie,[gasps] I dunno. I'll have to check my schedule.
Baby Cakes,Charlotte Fullerton,mr. cake,"Mr. Now, Pinkie, are you sure you really understand the responsibility of watching over two babies?"
Baby Cakes,Charlotte Fullerton,pinkie pie,"I can be responsible. Why, responsibility is my middle name. Pinkie Responsibility Pie."
Baby Cakes,Charlotte Fullerton,mrs. cake,"Mrs. But this time you need to take care of them, not just play with them. You have to be responsible."
Baby Cakes,Charlotte Fullerton,pinkie pie,"Yes, I know. I will. I am."
Baby Cakes,Charlotte Fullerton,mrs. cake,"Mrs. Oh, here you are, dearie. All your responsibilities are on this list."
Baby Cakes,Charlotte Fullerton,pinkie pie,Whoa! That's a lot of responsi<U+0096> Consider it done.

Baby Cakes,Charlotte Fullerton,pinkie pie,First you jiggle your tail! Oink oink oink! Then you wriggle your snout! Oink oink oink! Then you wiggle your rump! Oink oink oink! Then shout it out! Oink oink oink!
Baby Cakes,Charlotte Fullerton,pinkie pie,"There, see? Nothing to this babysitting business! Ugh!"
Baby Cakes,Charlotte Fullerton,pinkie pie,"Snack time. That's easy enough. Okie-dokie! Eat up! Like this! Num-num-num, num-num-num-num! Ahh!"

Baby Cakes,Charlotte Fullerton,pinkie pie,Oh! Thank goodness they're home!
Baby Cakes,Charlotte Fullerton,twilight sparkle,"Hi! I finished up the work I had to do, so I thought I'd stop by and see if you needed any help. Whoa!"
Baby Cakes,Charlotte Fullerton,pinkie pie,"Thank you, thank you, thank you for coming! I can't begin to tell you what my day has been like! I mean, these babies just won't listen to reason, and don't even get me started on their taste in stand-up comedy."
Baby Cakes,Charlotte Fullerton,twilight sparkle,"It's okay, Pinkie. I figured you would need some help. That's why I stopped by."
Baby Cakes,Charlotte Fullerton,pinkie pie,Ex-cuse me?
Baby Cakes,Charlotte Fullerton,twilight sparkle,"Babies take a lot of work, and some ponies are just not cut out to handle the responsibility."
Baby Cakes,Charlotte Fullerton,pinkie pie,"Is that so? Well, thanks for stopping by, Twilight. Sorry, I don't have time to visit. I'm very very busy with my responsibilities here."
Baby Cakes,Charlotte Fullerton,twilight sparkle,I'm happy to help! It's no trouble<U+0096>
Baby Cakes,Charlotte Fullerton,pinkie pie,"Well, of all the<U+0096> She thinks I can't handle things on my own! Maybe because I haven't handled things on my own. Well, I can handle things on my own!"
Baby Cakes,Charlotte Fullerton,pinkie pie,"Pound Cake. [growls] This is a crib. It is only to be used for napping, sleeping, and on occasion with permission, as a pretend old-timey Western fort. It is not a trampoline, so stop your jumping right now, mister!"
Baby Cakes,Charlotte Fullerton,pinkie pie,"And you, young filly. We do not put anything in our mouth that we cannot safely and properly digest, so stop slobbering on that toy this instant!"
Baby Cakes,Charlotte Fullerton,pinkie pie,"Now, we've all had a very exhausting afternoon, and it's time for all good little foals to take their nap. So, fall asleep!"
Baby Cakes,Charlotte Fullerton,pinkie pie,[sighs] [kisses twice] Sleep tight.
Baby Cakes,Charlotte Fullerton,pinkie pie,"Oh, nononono. Not good, not good, not good! Pound? Pumpkin? Where are you? Come out, come out, wherever you are!"
Baby Cakes,Charlotte Fullerton,pinkie pie,"Whoa! You be a good little girl now, Pumpkin-wumpkin, and stay in your crib for your pal Pinkie-winkie!"
Baby Cakes,Charlotte Fullerton,pinkie pie,"Pound Cake? [clicks] Here, Pound Cake!"
Baby Cakes,Charlotte Fullerton,pinkie pie,"Uh, Pound Cake? Uh..."
Baby Cakes,Charlotte Fullerton,pinkie pie,[squeals] You can fly?!
Baby Cakes,Charlotte Fullerton,pinkie pie,Oh... get down here... this instant... young... colt! [gasps for breath] I'm responsible for you!
Baby Cakes,Charlotte Fullerton,pinkie pie,"No no no, Pumpkin."
Baby Cakes,Charlotte Fullerton,pinkie pie,No no.
Baby Cakes,Charlotte Fullerton,pinkie pie,"No. Hmph! I am the responsible one, and I said no."
Baby Cakes,Charlotte Fullerton,pinkie pie,"That goes for you too, Pound Cake!"
Baby Cakes,Charlotte Fullerton,pinkie pie,"Mm, razzleberry. I'm- not- letting- go! I'm- re-spon-si-ble!"
Baby Cakes,Charlotte Fullerton,pinkie pie,"Oh, not you too! There! Now who's the responsible one?"
Baby Cakes,Charlotte Fullerton,pinkie pie,"[giggles] Y'know, you're right. That is funny."
Baby Cakes,Charlotte Fullerton,pinkie pie,"Dear Princess Celestia,"
Baby Cakes,Charlotte Fullerton,pinkie pie,"I've always had fun playing with little kids, and I thought babysitting meant just more playtime, right? Wrong! Being a caregiver is way more responsibility than just being a playmate. And today, I learned that sometimes our desire for responsibility can outrun our actual ability to handle it."
Baby Cakes,Charlotte Fullerton,mr. cake,Mr. Pinkie Pie! We're back!
Baby Cakes,Charlotte Fullerton,mr. cake,Mr. Are we in the right place?
Baby Cakes,Charlotte Fullerton,pinkie pie,Shhh!
Baby Cakes,Charlotte Fullerton,mrs. cake,Mrs. P-Pinkie. This is just... just...
Baby Cakes,Charlotte Fullerton,mr. cake,Mr. Amazing is what it is. We had no idea how responsible you really are. Would you be interested in becoming our go-to babysitter on a permanent basis?
Baby Cakes,Charlotte Fullerton,pinkie pie,[gasps] Hm- Ah- lemme check my schedule! I should be available a week from... never!
Baby Cakes,Charlotte Fullerton,pinkie pie,[happily gasps] I have some free time next Tuesday.

The Last Roundup,Amy Keating Rogers,granny smith,I want you to show all them highfalutin rodeo ponies what a real rodeo pony's like!
The Last Roundup,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"You betcha, Granny Smith."

The Last Roundup,Amy Keating Rogers,fluttershy,"Oh, I hope Applejack is surprised by this surprise party!"
The Last Roundup,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,"Well, that is the point."
The Last Roundup,Amy Keating Rogers,fluttershy,"I know, but I hope she isn't so surprised she's startled, because while being surprised can be nice, being startled can be... very startling."
The Last Roundup,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,Surprise!
The Last Roundup,Amy Keating Rogers,fluttershy,"[gasps] Oh, Pinkie, you startled me."
The Last Roundup,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"Sorry! I was just practicing my ""surprise!"" for when we surprise Applejack with this super cool party for becoming rodeo champeen of Equestria! Surprise!"
The Last Roundup,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"Quiet, Pinkie, I think Applejack's coming!"
The Last Roundup,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,Surprise! Shoot!
The Last Roundup,Amy Keating Rogers,apple bloom,"Who's it from, Twilight? What's it say?"
The Last Roundup,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"It's from Applejack. ""Family and friends, not coming back to Ponyville."""
The Last Roundup,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"""...Don't worry, will send money soon."" That's all there is."
The Last Roundup,Amy Keating Rogers,apple bloom,Applejack's... not comin' back?
The Last Roundup,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,What do you mean Applejack's not coming back?! She loves Ponyville!
The Last Roundup,Amy Keating Rogers,granny smith,And she loves Sweet Apple Acres!
The Last Roundup,Amy Keating Rogers,apple bloom,And she loves her family!
The Last Roundup,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,[gasps] Something just dreadful must have happened to Applejack to make her not return!
The Last Roundup,Amy Keating Rogers,fluttershy,"Maybe she's hurt, or sad, or scared!"
The Last Roundup,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,"So, what are we waiting for? Let's go find her!"
The Last Roundup,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,Don't worry. We'll search all of Equestria if we have to. We'll bring her back.
The Last Roundup,Amy Keating Rogers,apple bloom,Y'all are the best.
The Last Roundup,Amy Keating Rogers,granny smith,"Thank you, girls! [to Big McIntosh] Our little bushel just lost one apple."
The Last Roundup,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,I hope this lead doesn't turn out to be a dead end. I don't wanna go home empty-hooved after promising we'd find her.
The Last Roundup,Amy Keating Rogers,fluttershy,I don't know how we'll break it to the Apple family.
The Last Roundup,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,I don't know how we'll break it to Ponyville!
The Last Roundup,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,I don't know how I'll make it to the next stop!
The Last Roundup,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"This is Dodge Junction, girls. Applejack is supposed to have come here after the rodeo ended. Let's fan out and try to find her."
The Last Roundup,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"Ooh, pickles! [knocking] Hurryhurryhurryhurryhurry! Hurry it up in there!"
The Last Roundup,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"Huh, some ponies. Sheesh."
The Last Roundup,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"Applejack! I found her, I found her, I found her, I found her, I found her!"
The Last Roundup,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,"Oh, Applejack, thank heavens!"
The Last Roundup,Amy Keating Rogers,fluttershy,We're so glad you're safe!
The Last Roundup,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"I found her, I found her, I found her, I found her! Be right back."
The Last Roundup,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"Uh, hey, everypony. What's up?"
The Last Roundup,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,Why didn't you come back to Ponyville?!
The Last Roundup,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,"Yes, why are you here?"
The Last Roundup,Amy Keating Rogers,fluttershy,Are you okay?
The Last Roundup,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,Do you have any snacks?
The Last Roundup,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"Tell us what happened, Applejack!"
The Last Roundup,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"Yes, ma'am."
The Last Roundup,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,And you are?
The Last Roundup,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"Aw shucks, Miss Jubilee. You don't have to go into all that."
The Last Roundup,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,"""Change of scenery""? What's that supposed to mean?"
The Last Roundup,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"S'no big deal, guys. I thought cherries would be a nice change from apples, so I took the job and came here. That's it. End of story."
The Last Roundup,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"That's it? Well, that's a terrible story!"
The Last Roundup,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"Sorry, but that's all there is to tell. Thanks for checkin' on me, but y'all can go home now. Tell my family hi, and that I'm doing a-okay."
The Last Roundup,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,"Excuse me, AJ, but we didn't travel all over Equestria searching for you to come home without you!"
The Last Roundup,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"Well, I didn't ask you to come lookin' for me! There is nothin' to tell and I am not going back to Ponyville!"
The Last Roundup,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,I don't care what she says. Applejack's not telling us something.
The Last Roundup,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,Twilight's right. We gotta get her to spill the beans.
The Last Roundup,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"What?! She had beans? Ugh, I told her I was snacky!"
The Last Roundup,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"Sure am, Miss Jubilee."
The Last Roundup,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,What are you all doing here?
The Last Roundup,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,We're your cherry sorters. Shall we get started?
The Last Roundup,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,Fine.
The Last Roundup,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,What are you five up to?
The Last Roundup,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,"Well, uh, you made working on a cherry orchard sound... so delightful."
The Last Roundup,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"Uh-huh. Well, just remember: No talking about Ponyville."
The Last Roundup,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,Fine! Why don't you quit talking and get walking?
The Last Roundup,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"So, AJ, how was Canterlot? Not talking about Ponyville, talking about Canterlot, totally different town."
The Last Roundup,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,Canterlot was fine.
The Last Roundup,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,Was the rodeo fun?
The Last Roundup,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,Yes.
The Last Roundup,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,Did you meet some nice ponies there?
The Last Roundup,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,Some.
The Last Roundup,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,Really? Did you see Wild Bull Hickok? What about Calamity Mane?
The Last Roundup,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"Yes, I saw 'em both."
The Last Roundup,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,And how did you meet Miss Jubilee?
The Last Roundup,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"Um, well, Miss Jubilee had a cherry stand at the rodeo. Real good treats."
The Last Roundup,Amy Keating Rogers,fluttershy,"Um, excuse me?"
The Last Roundup,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"Cherry winks, cherry cheesecake, cherry tarts. We struck up a conversation, being orchard folk and all."
The Last Roundup,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,So you told her about Sweet Apple Acres?
The Last Roundup,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,Yes.
The Last Roundup,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,Did you tell her why you weren't going back?
The Last Roundup,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"No, 'cuz it was none of her business!"
The Last Roundup,Amy Keating Rogers,fluttershy,Ooh... Can you please slow down?
The Last Roundup,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,Is it because I made it rain on you that one time?
The Last Roundup,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,No!
The Last Roundup,Amy Keating Rogers,fluttershy,Help!
The Last Roundup,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,Is it because you were insulted when I gave you that book on organized orchards?
The Last Roundup,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,NO!
The Last Roundup,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,Is it because you were insulted when I insulted your hair?
The Last Roundup,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"No, no, NO! I'm not telling you why, so just<U+0096>"
The Last Roundup,Amy Keating Rogers,fluttershy,STOP!
The Last Roundup,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"Well, girls, we seem to be striking out."
The Last Roundup,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,That's 'cause we're playing too nice.
The Last Roundup,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,Yes. Desperate times do call for desperate measures.
The Last Roundup,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,It's time to call in the big guns.
The Last Roundup,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"Hey, Applejack. Need some help?"
The Last Roundup,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,You promise not to ask me any questions?
The Last Roundup,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,I promise.
The Last Roundup,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"Have you ever had a cherrychanga? Ooh! Sorry, that was a question."
The Last Roundup,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"That kind of question is fine, Pinkie. No, I-I never had a cherrychanga."
The Last Roundup,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"Well, no wonder, because I made it up myself! A cherrychanga is mashed up cherries in a tortilla that's deep fried. Cherrychanga. Great name, huh? Oh, but maybe I should call it a chimicherry. Ooh, that's good too. Which do you think sounds better? Cherrychanga or chimicherry? Or what if I combine them? Chimicherrychanga! What sounds the funniest? I like funny words! One of my favorite funny words is 'kumquat'! I didn't make that one up. I would work in a kumquat orchard just so I could say 'kumquat' all day! Kumquat, kumquat, kumquat! And 'pickle barrel'! Isn't that just the funnest thing to say? Pickle barrel, pickle barrel, pickle barrel! Say it with me! Pickle barrel, kumquat, pickle barrel, kumquat, pickle barrel, kumquat, chimicherrychanga!"
The Last Roundup,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"No! Make it stop, make it stop!"
The Last Roundup,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,The only way to make it stop is for you to spill the beans!
The Last Roundup,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,Never!
The Last Roundup,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"Alright, alright! I'll tell everypony what's goin' on! Just please stop talkin'! But... can it wait 'til tomorrow at breakfast? I'm plum tuckered out."
The Last Roundup,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,"Tomorrow, huh? I don't know..."
The Last Roundup,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,Do you Pinkie promise?
The Last Roundup,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,[sighs] I will tell you the whole truth at breakfast. Pinkie promise.
The Last Roundup,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,I'm glad we're finally gonna get some answers from Applejack.
The Last Roundup,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,"Yeah, maybe."
The Last Roundup,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"Don't worry, Rainbow. She's gotta 'fess up after making a Pinkie promise."
The Last Roundup,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,Nopony breaks a Pinkie promise!
The Last Roundup,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,Applejack! [slightly distorted] You Pinkie promised!
The Last Roundup,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"Applejack, come back here!"
The Last Roundup,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"Giddy up, fellas, I gotta get the heck out of Dodge!"
The Last Roundup,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,She's gonna get away!
The Last Roundup,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"Oh no, she won't! Look, girls!"
The Last Roundup,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"Follow that stagecoach! Oh, we have you now!"
The Last Roundup,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,Whoa! What the hay?
The Last Roundup,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,Pull over!
The Last Roundup,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,Hey! Cut that out! Whoa! [to coach ponies] I'll pay you double to outrun them.
The Last Roundup,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,We'll pay you triple to slow down!
The Last Roundup,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,I'll pay you quadruple to leave them in the dust!
The Last Roundup,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,That was rude!
The Last Roundup,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,Get them! Get them!
The Last Roundup,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,"Come on, Fluttershy!"
The Last Roundup,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"Hyah! C'mon, y'all! Go, go!"
The Last Roundup,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"Applejack, you broke your Pinkie promise! Apologize!"
The Last Roundup,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"Pinkie, I did not break my promise!"
The Last Roundup,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,Wha?
The Last Roundup,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"If y'all reckon back, I told you that I would tell you everything at breakfast. But I didn't come for breakfast. I couldn't come to that breakfast, not if it meant telling y'all what happened."
The Last Roundup,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"Well, I... I..."
The Last Roundup,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"I'm sorry, Pinkie, but I can't tell y'all the truth. I just can't!"
The Last Roundup,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"Well I heard a ""sorry"" in there, so that'll have to do for now. I'll get a real apology later. Rarity, catch me."
The Last Roundup,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"Rainbow, go back!"
The Last Roundup,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,No time! They knew what they were getting into!
The Last Roundup,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,Yes. Hyah!
The Last Roundup,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,Yee-haw!
The Last Roundup,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"Ha, try and catch me now. Oh, nuts."
The Last Roundup,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,Not so fast!
The Last Roundup,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,Fine. Now you know.
The Last Roundup,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,Know what?
The Last Roundup,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"Well, just look!"
The Last Roundup,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"I am. You won an amazing number of ribbons, just like Miss Jubilee said!"
The Last Roundup,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"Don't you get it? There's every color of ribbon down there. Every color... but... blue. I came in fourth, third, even second, but I didn't win one first prize, and I certainly didn't win any prize money."
The Last Roundup,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,But the telegram said you were gonna send money.
The Last Roundup,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"That's why I came here. I wanted to earn some money. After that big old send off Ponyville gave me, I just didn't have the nerve to come home empty-hooved. I couldn't come home a failure."
The Last Roundup,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"Applejack, you're not a failure."
The Last Roundup,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,And we're your friends! We don't care if you came in fiftieth place! You're still number one in our books.
The Last Roundup,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,So... you're not upset or disappointed?
The Last Roundup,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,But what about the mayor? I don't think I can face her and tell her I didn't get that money to fix the broken roof.
The Last Roundup,Amy Keating Rogers,fluttershy,"Applejack, we can always find a way to fix that hole in the roof. But if you don't come back, we'll never be able to fix the hole in our hearts."
The Last Roundup,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,[sniffles] Darn it! Now you got me acting all sappy!
The Last Roundup,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"Dear Princess Celestia,"
The Last Roundup,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,It's a tad easier to be proud when you come in first than it is when you finish further back. But there's no reason to hide when you don't do as well as you'd hoped. You can't run away from your problems. Better to run to your friends and family.
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,[yawns] Who could that be? It's still dark!
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,"C'mon, Fluttershy! Cider season's about to start!"
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,"[squee] [shrieks] Oh, where are we? What's the rush?"
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,The rush? Don't you remember what happened last year? Or the year before that? Or pretty much any cider season ever?
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,"Um, well, uh<U+0096>"
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,"Pinkie Pie. She always ends up ahead of us in line, and then they always run out of cider!"
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,I guess I<U+0096>
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,"Gee, Rainbow Dash. It looks like a few other ponies had the same idea."
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,"Oh, gosh, Pinkie. I love your new style."
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,Who are all these ponies?!
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,"Isn't this great? I couldn't sleep last night 'cause I was so excited about cider season, and I had this brilliant idea to come down here and camp out, so I told a few others about it, and they all thought it was a great idea too, and now it's just a big old cider party! Woo-hoo! Oh, gosh, that's a lot of ponies. Hope they don't run out before you get any."
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Isn't this exciting, Spike? Opening day of cider season!"
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,spike,Yeah! That means it's only thirty more days 'til sapphire season!
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,applejack,"[through megaphone] Attention, everypony! Cider season is now officially open!"
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,applejack,"Heh. Sorry, everypony! That's it for today!"
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,"Surprise, surprise. You ran out again!"
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,"For the record, I don't mind<U+0096>"
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,Why can't you make enough cider for all of us? Or at least for me!
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,applejack,"Hold on, everypony. We've done our best to improve supply this year-"
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,applejack,"And it's always true. But Apple family cider is made with love and integrity, and only the highest quality apples in Equestria. Sorry, but that recipe takes time."
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,applejack,"If y'all just be patient, we'll have plenty more tomorrow."
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,"She's right, y'know! You can't rush perfection! And this year's batch was perfection!"
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,"Uh, Pinkie Pie<U+0096>"
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,applejack,What in Equestria is that?
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,flim,"Well, lookie what we got here, brother of mine, it's the same in every town Ponies with thirsty throats, dry tongues, and not a drop of cider to be found Maybe they're not aware that there's really no need for this teary despair"
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,flam,That the key that they need to solve this sad cider shortage you and I will share
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,flam,He's Flim
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,flim,He's Flam
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,Nonpa-what?
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,flim,"Nonpareil, and that's exactly the reason why, you see No pony else in this whole place will give you such a chance to be where you need to be And that's a new world, with tons of cider Fresh squeezed and ready for drinking"
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,flam,More cider than you could drink in all your days of thinking
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,I doubt that.
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,flam,He's Flim
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,flim,He's Flam
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,flim,I suppose by now you're wondering 'bout our peculiar mode of transport
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,flam,"I say, our mode of locomotion"
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,flim,"And I suppose by now you're wondering, where is this promised cider?"
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,flam,Any horse can make a claim and any pony can do the same
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,flim,But my brother and I have something most unique and superb Unseen at any time in this big new world

The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,flam,"What d'you say, sister?"
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,flim,"Young filly, I would be ever so honored if you might see fit to let my brother and I borrow some of your delicious, and might I add spellbindingly fragrant apples for our little demonstration here?"
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,applejack,"Uh, sure, I guess."
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,flam,"Ready, Flim?"
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,flim,"Ready, Flam?"

The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,flam,Feel free to take a sneak peek!
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,granny smith,"Now wait, you fellers, hold it! You went and over-sold it! I guarantee that what you have there won't compare For the very most important ingredient Can't be added or done expedient And it's quality, friends, Apple Acres' quality and care!"
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,flim,"Well, Granny, I'm glad you brought that up, my dear, I say I'm glad you brought that up You see that we are very picky when it comes to cider if you'll kindly try a cup"
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,flam,"Yes, sir, yes, ma'am, this great machine lets just the very best  So whaddaya say then, Apples?  Care to step into the modern world And put the Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000 to the test?"
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,flim,"What do you think, folks? Do you see what the Apples can't? I see it clear as day! I know she does! So does he! C'mon, Ponyville, you know what I'm talking about!"
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,apple bloom,You got a deal!
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,granny smith,Not so fast! No way no how that machine matches up with the care we put in our cider!
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,apple bloom,"But if it really does work, we could make everypony in town happy!"
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,applejack,"I just don't know, y'all. We've always made cider the same way."
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,big mcintosh,Eeyup. Huh?

The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,applejack,Hold on. Who gets the seventy five?
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,flim,"Why, us, naturally."
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,flam,"And, we'll throw in the magic to power the machine for free."
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,applejack,Cider sales keep our business afloat through the winter. We'd lose Sweet Apple Acres if we agreed to this.
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,big mcintosh,No deal.
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,flim,"Hmph. Very well. If you refuse our generous offer to be partners, then we'll just have to be competitors."

The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,apple bloom,What?
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,Still worried about Flim and Flam?
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,spike,Granny Smith says they were just blowing hot air.
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,applejack,I'm not so sure. They sounded mighty serious when they threatened to run us out of business.
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,apple bloom,That's it! Last cup!
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,"Oh, for Pete's sake!"
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,apple bloom,"C'mon back tomorrow, everypony!"
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,flim,What seems to be the problem here?
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,flam,"Oh my, oh my, out of cider again?"
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,flim,What have we here? Who'd like a cup?
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,flam,"Don't worry, everypony, we've got the Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000 to make more in an instant!"
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,applejack,You can't sell that cider! That's made from Apple family apples!
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,Is this some kind of cruel joke?
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,flim,"Don't worry, everypony, there are plenty of apples in Equestria. We'll find some others and make more cider than all of Ponyville can drink!"
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,apple bloom,We'll make more cider than you could ever imagine!
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,granny smith,"Now, it ain't about the speed, young'un, it's about quality."
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,Who cares how good the cider is if I never get to drink any?
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,flim,"Oh, look at these poor, dissatisfied ponies."
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,apple bloom,Ponyville is Sweet Apple Cider country!
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,applejack,Our cider speaks for itself!
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,flim,Let's put it to the test!
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,apple bloom,"Anywhere, anytime!"

The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,flim,"What's the matter, Granny Smith? Chicken?"
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,granny smith,"What did you call me, sonny?"
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,flim,"If you're so confident in your cider, then what's the problem?"
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,granny smith,"Tomorrow mornin', right here!"
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,flam,But I'm afraid we haven't any... [spits] ...apples.
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,granny smith,You can use our south field! It'll be worth it to teach y'all a thing or two about cider making!
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,flim,Excellent; we have a bet. Whoever produces the most barrels in one hour wins the exclusive right to sell cider in Ponyville.
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,granny smith,"And after we beat ya, I don't never want to see you bambahoozlers around here again!"
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,flam,Until tomorrow.
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Don't worry, Applejack, I know you'll win tomorrow!"
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,applejack,"We'd better, 'cause if we don't, we're gonna lose our farm."
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,Applejack? Are you sure this is such a good idea?
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,applejack,Me 'n' the family are... one hundred percent confident... in our cider making capabilities.
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,apple bloom,"And besides, nopony calls Granny a chicken."
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,mayor mare,"[through megaphone] Attention, everypony!"
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Well, good luck."
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,applejack,"Thanks, Twilight. We'll need it."
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,mayor mare,"[through megaphone] The teams have one hour to produce as much cider as they can, after which the barrels will be counted and the winner will be named the sole cider provider for all of Ponyville!"
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,mayor mare,Are both teams ready?
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,applejack,Ready!
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,mayor mare,Then let's... go!
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,granny smith,"Ugh, bad 'un. Good 'un! Bad 'un..."

The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,apple bloom,What?!
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,applejack,"C'mon, Apple Bloom, focus! We gotta forget those guys if we're gonna have a chance of winnin'!"
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,apple bloom,"Sorry, sis! Better keep up, Granny, we're fallin' behind!"
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,granny smith,"Egh... [sniffs] Good 'un... Ugh, bad 'un..."
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,applejack,"Rest when it's over, Big McIntosh! Ride! Ride!"
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,rarity,This is just dreadful. Even at top speed the Apples are only making one barrel to the twins' three!
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Um, Miss Mayor! Are honorary family members allowed to help in the competition?"
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,mayor mare,"Well, I'm not sure... Flim, Flam, would you object to honorary family members helping?"
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,flim,Are you kidding?
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,flam,We don't care if the whole kingdom of Canterlot helps. It's a lost cause.
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,mayor mare,"Hm, I guess it's okay. Applejack? What do you think?"
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,applejack,I think I'd love to have the rest of my family helpin' out.
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Okay, everypony, we're not gonna let those smooth talkers take our friend's farm."
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Fluttershy, help Applejack with the trees."
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,Got it.
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Pinkie Pie, you're on apple catching detail."

The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Rarity, you've got a discerning eye. Help Granny Smith at the quality control station."
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,rarity,Of course.
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Rainbow Dash, do you think you can help Big McIntosh press?"
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,In my sleep!
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Alright, everypony, let's save Sweet Apple Acres!"
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,"Over there, Apple Bloom! Don't miss them!"
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,apple bloom,"Right behind you, Pinkie Pie!"
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,granny smith,"Good 'un, bad 'un, bad 'un, good 'un..."
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,rarity,"Lovely, horrid, horrid, lovely..."
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Based on these figures, we're making five barrels for every three of theirs!"
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,applejack,"Keep it up, everypony! We're back in this!"
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,flim,"[spits] Come on, brother, we've gotta pick up the pace!"
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,flam,"Right, uh, double the power!"
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,flim,We've gotta try something else!
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,flam,"I've got it, brother of mine."
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,flim,"Well done, Flam! We're at top productivity!"
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"C'mon, Rainbow Dash, keep grinding!"
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,We don't have time for quality control if we wanna win this thing!
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,granny smith,"[yelps] Get back, you! One bad apple spoils the bunch!"
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,"Applejack, help me!"
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,applejack,There's no point in winnin' if we cheat!
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"We'll just have to work harder! C'mon, everypony!"
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,"All right then, double time!"
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,mayor mare,Time's up!
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"I'm proud of you, Applejack."
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,Integrity like that will always be... rewarded.

The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,flim,"Daww, too bad, Apples."
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,flam,Guess you'll just have to find a new line of work that doesn't match your names quite so... perfectly.
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,flim,"Now should we tear down all these tacky old buildings and put up new ones, brother?"
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,flam,"I don't see why not, brother. After all, this isn't Sweet Apple Acres anymore. How about 'Flim Flam Fields'?"
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,I ought to press you into jerk cider!
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,applejack,"No, Rainbow Dash. A deal's a deal."
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,applejack,"Congratulations to y'all. The cider business in Ponyville... is yours. C'mon, Apples. Let's go pack up our things."
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,flim,"Fear not, everypony, there's more than enough cider to go around."
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,applejack,"Go ahead, everypony. Go on, y'all. It's okay."
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,flam,"Drink up, Ponyville! Down the hatch!"
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,sweetie drops,Mine's got rocks in it!
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,flam,You wouldn't pay even one cent?
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,flam,How about two cups for one cent?
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,flam,[nervous noises] It looks like we've encountered a slight... problem here in Ponyville.
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,flim,Nopony wants our product. Next town?
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,flam,"Next town. Let's go, Flim!"
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,flim,"Let's go, Flam!"
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,applejack,They're gone.
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,That means Sweet Apple Acres is still in business!
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,apple bloom,"Because of this silly competition, we've made enough of our cider for the whole town!"
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,applejack,"Dear Princess Celestia,"
The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000,M. A. Larson,applejack,"I wanted to share my thoughts with you. [clears throat] I didn't learn anythin'! Ha! I was right all along! If you take your time to do things the right way, your work will speak for itself.

Read It and Weep,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,"No thanks. I so don't read. I'm a world-class athlete. Reading's for eggheads like you, Twilight. Heh, no offense, but I am not reading. It's undeniably, unquestionably, uncool."
Read It and Weep,Cindy Morrow,applejack,Is she serious? Who doesn't like to read a bang-up tale from time to time?
Read It and Weep,Cindy Morrow,rarity,"Why, a good book is almost as magnificent as silk pajamas on a Sunday morning, heh!"
Read It and Weep,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,"Reading is for everypony, Rainbow Dash!"

Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,sweetie belle,"I know what you mean. If it's for Miss Cheerilee, it needs to be perfect. Hearts and Hooves Day only comes once a year, after all."
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,scootaloo,I say we add a little more ribbon!
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,sweetie belle,"Mm-hmm, yeah, yeah. And just a tiny bit more lace."
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,A few more hoof-prints.
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,scootaloo,Glitter! It could definitely use just a little more glitter!
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,Now that'll show Miss Cheerilee how much we care about her. Just have to get it to the Hearts and Hooves party at school.
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,scootaloo,I think we're gonna need a bigger envelope.
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,diamond tiara,I like the red ones.
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,cheerilee,It's lovely. And so... big!
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,We just wanted to let you know that we think you're the best teacher in the whole wide world! And we think you're super! And that we love you so so much! And we want you to have the best Hearts and Hooves Day<U+0096>
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,cheerilee,"Thank you so much, girls. I love it. I really do."
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,sweetie belle,I'm sure it's nothing compared to the gifts you've gotten from your... very special somepony.
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,cheerilee,"Oh, I don't have a very special somepony at the moment."
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,Really?
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,sweetie belle,How could somepony as amazing as you not have a very special somepony on Hearts and Hooves Day?
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,cheerilee,"It's alright, Sweetie Belle. I have lots of good friends and wonderful students who care about me very much. I'm gonna have an absolutely terrific Hearts and Hooves Day. Alright, everypony, who's ready to play ""Pin the Heart on the Pony""?"
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,"If anypony deserves a very special somepony, it's her."
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,"Uh, you all right?"
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,sweetie belle,I'm more than all right. I've just come up with the best idea ever. We're gonna find Miss Cheerilee a very special somepony.
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,That is the best idea ever.
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,sweetie belle,[singsong voice] Tooold yooou!
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,So what are we waiting for? Hearts and Hooves Day is almost over! Let's get out there and find somepony special for Cheerilee already.
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,sweetie belle,Yeah!
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,scootaloo,Let's do it!
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,sweetie belle,Now it can't be just anypony. Miss Cheerilee is one of the best mares in Ponyville. She deserves to have one of the best stallions as her very special somepony.
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,sweetie belle,"Cheerilee is sweet and kind, She's the best teacher we could hope for. The perfect stallion you and I must find One to really make her heart so-o-oar. But... This one's too young, This one's too old. He clearly has a terrible cold."
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,This guy's too silly. He's way too uptight.
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,sweetie belle,"Well nothing's wrong with this one, He seems alright..."
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,scootaloo,His girlfriend sure thinks so.
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,sweetie belle,How 'bout this one?
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,He's much too flashy.
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,scootaloo,He might do!
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,Too short.
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,sweetie belle,Too tall.
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,Too clean.
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,scootaloo,Too smelly.
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,sweetie belle,Too strangely obsessed with tubs of jelly.
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,"I don't think that we're mistaken, It seems all the good ones are taken."
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,sweetie belle,"I really feel that at this rate, We'll never find the perfect date."
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,scootaloo,Doing anything special for Hearts and Hooves Day?
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,sweetie belle,"Oh please, oh please oh please say-"
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,big mcintosh,Nope.
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,sweetie belle,"We did it girls, We've found the one, Who will send our teacher's heart aflutter!"
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,Wait a minute. Lemme get this straight. Are you talkin' 'bout my brother?
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,scootaloo,"Sweetie Belle is right. Big McIntosh is the perfect match for Miss Cheerilee. He's really nice, super hard-working."
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,Hmm... but he's also pretty shy. He's never gonna ask Miss Cheerilee to be his very special somepony.
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,sweetie belle,Maybe he doesn't have to.
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,Huh?
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,sweetie belle,"If we can get Big Mac and Miss Cheerilee in a really romantic setting, I bet she'll ask him."
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,scootaloo,Sounds like a plan to me.
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,So? What are we waitin' for? Let's get out there and create the perfect date!
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,sweetie belle,Flowers. Don't forget the flowers.
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,Oops. I'm on it!
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,scootaloo,[gasp] They're coming! This is gonna be perfect. Miss Cheerilee is gonna have the best Hearts and Hooves Day ever.
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,sweetie belle,With her new very special somepony.
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,cheerilee,"Hi, girls."
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,cheerilee,So you three said you needed help identifying a tree you found here near the gazebo?
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,cheerilee,[dryly] That's an apple tree.
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,Is it?
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,"Oh, sorry, big brother. We went and fixed up the gazebo all on our own. See?"
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,scootaloo,"As long as you're here, why not have a bite to eat from this romantic-looking picnic? Oh gosh, seems like there's only room for two."
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,I guess we'll just be goin' then.
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,scootaloo,You really think this'll work?
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,sweetie belle,Of course it will work. They're perfect for each other.
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,cheerilee,Beautiful day we're having.
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,big mcintosh,Eeyup.
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,cheerilee,Any big plans for tonight?
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,big mcintosh,Nnnope.
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,"Oh, come on, Miss Cheerilee, ask him to be your very special somepony."
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,sweetie belle,"[gasp] Ohmigosh, look."
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,cheerilee,Big Mac...
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,big mcintosh,Eeyup?
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,cheerilee,You have something stuck in your teeth.
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,sweetie belle,"Aw, come on!"
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,cheerilee,Well this has been... strange.
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,big mcintosh,Eeyup.
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,cheerilee,"I need to get going, but it's always great running into a good friend."
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,big mcintosh,Yup.
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,[sigh] Do you think it just wasn't romantic enough?
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,scootaloo,Maybe it was too romantic.
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,sweetie belle,"[sigh] Either way, we failed."
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,[sigh] There's gotta be somethin' else we could<U+0096> UGH!
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"Oh my goodness, I didn't even see you there. I'm so so sorry."
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,"Aw, it's okay, Twilight. It was an accident."
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,I've just been reading the most fascinating book about Hearts and Hooves Day. Did you know that this holiday got its start because of a love potion?
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,sweetie belle,Did you say... a love potion?
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,That's right. It even has the recipe.
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,sweetie belle,"I... don't suppose we could borrow that book for a little while, do ya?"
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Of course you can. I have another book here that I think you'll<U+0096>
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,sweetie belle,[giggling] Take a tuft of cloud;
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,sweetie belle,A bright rainbow's glow;
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,sweetie belle,Stir with a Pegasus feather<U+0096>
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,scootaloo,Hey!
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,sweetie belle,"Fast, not slow."
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,Serve to two ponies who aren't in the know.
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,I feel kind of bad trickin' my brother and Miss Cheerilee this way.
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,sweetie belle,What's the problem? We all agreed these two are perfect for one another.
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,scootaloo,"Yeah, they just need a little nudge."
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,sweetie belle,"And what could make them happier than being together, right?"
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,Right!
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,scootaloo,"Oh, oh, here they come."
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,"Hiya, Miss Cheerilee."
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,cheerilee,"Hello again, girls. Hello, Big Mac. Would you three like to tell us why it was so very important that we meet you here<U+0096>"
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,sweetie belle,Punch!
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,cheerilee,Excuse me?
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,sweetie belle,"Punch! We made punch. We were gonna set up a stand and try to sell it but, heh, we needed somepony to taste-test it first."
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,Yup.
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,cheerilee,"I'm very sorry about this. I mentioned to the girls that I don't have a very special somepony, and I believe they're putting us in these awkward situations because they've decided it should be you."
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,cheerilee,I suppose we should just humor them for a moment. This punch does look delicious.
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,big mcintosh,Eeyup.
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,sweetie belle,I think they're gonna drink it.
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,cheerilee,To good friends!
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,scootaloo,They're drinking it. They're drinking it!
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,scootaloo,They're looking into each other's eyes.
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,cheerilee,Big Mac?
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,big mcintosh,Yup?
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,cheerilee,Will you be my very special somepony?
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,big mcintosh,Eeyup.
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,sweetie belle,YES!
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,cheerilee,He's my special somepony.
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,big mcintosh,Eeeeeyup.
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,cheerilee,He's my shmoopy-doopy sweetie-weetie pony pie.
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,big mcintosh,You're my shmoopy-doopy sweetie-weetie pony pie.
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,Did he just say<U+0096>
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,cheerilee,You're my cutie-patootie lovie-dovie honey-bunny.
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,big mcintosh,You're my heartie-smartie smoochie-woochie baby-waby.
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,Big Mac! Hey! Hello! What's going on?
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,sweetie belle,"Miss Cheerilee, are you alright?"
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,cheerilee,I have a special somepony. A kissy-wissy snuggy-wuggy sugar bear.
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,sweetie belle,I think we may have given them too big of a nudge.
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,big mcintosh,You're my cuddly-wuddly boopsie-woopsie pumpkin pie.
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,scootaloo,Ya think?
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,What have we done?! My brother's actin' like a grade-A goofball!
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,sweetie belle,Maybe we added too much rainbow.
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,scootaloo,Or maybe not enough cloud.
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,sweetie belle,Or maybe... uh-oh.
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,"Whaddaya mean, ""uh-oh?!"""
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,sweetie belle,We might not have given Big Mac and Miss Cheerilee a love potion. We may have given them a love poison.
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,sweetie belle,"Apparently, some prince a long time ago whipped up this recipe and gave it to this princess he liked. He meant it to be a love potion, but things didn't turn out so well."
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,"How ""not so well"" did things turn out?"
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,sweetie belle,"Well, there's something here about a dragon, the kingdom falling, chaos reigning... Okay, apparently it was all because the prince and princess were so lost in each other's eyes that they couldn't perform their royal duties."
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,"Great! We've not only turned Big Mac and Miss Cheerilee into a couple of nonsense-spoutin' nincompoops, we may have put all of Ponyville in jeopardy!"
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,scootaloo,"Come on, Apple Bloom. Miss Cheerilee and Big Mac don't have any royal duties."
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,"But they still got responsibilities. If we don't fix this... Oh no, Miss Cheerilee won't be able to teach. Big Mac won't be able to harvest any apples, and before you know it... Ponyville will be overrun with uneducated little ponies starvin' for apples. Oh, it'll be chaos! It'll be chaos!"
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,sweetie belle,There's an antidote!
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,"Well, why didn't you say so? Didn't you see me gettin' all panicked back there?"
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,sweetie belle,"If we can keep Miss Cheerilee and Big Mac from looking into each other's eyes for one full hour, the love curse will be broken."
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,scootaloo,"Only an hour? Pfh, we can pull that off in a second."
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,cheerilee,"You take the first sip, snuggle-wuggles."
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,big mcintosh,"No, you take it, schnoodle-dumplin'."
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,cheerilee,"No, you, shnooky-lumps."
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,big mcintosh,"No, you, pookie-pie."
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,mrs. cake,"Mrs. I'm all for romance, but this has been going on for hours. What's happened to these two?"
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,sweetie belle,[nervous chuckle] Who knows?
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,mrs. cake,"Mrs. Well, these lovebirds will probably be planning a wedding soon. I can always use the catering business."
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,sweetie belle,A wedding! That's it! Miss Cheerilee and Big Mac should get married!
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,How is gettin' hitched gonna keep them apart?
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,sweetie belle,They aren't really gonna get married. They're just gonna get ready to get married.
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,cheerilee,"[chuckle] No, you, biscuit-wiscuit bear!"
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,big mcintosh,"Nope, you, huggy-wuggy snuggy bunny!"
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,sweetie belle,"Hi, Miss Cheerilee, how are you?"
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,cheerilee,I have a very special somepony.
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,big mcintosh,I have a very special somepony.
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,"Yeah, we noticed."
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,sweetie belle,"Gosh, you two are so in love, the next thing you know, you'll be getting married."
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,sweetie belle,That's right. Maaarriiied.
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,[gagging] Ugh!
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,"'Course, if you're gonna get married, you wanna pick out a really nice diamond for your <U+0096> ugh! <U+0096> shmoopy-doopy, uh, pookie-pie."
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,big mcintosh,Diamond!
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,cheerilee,[distressed] Shmoopy!
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,scootaloo,Don't you think you should start looking for your wedding dress? You'll wanna look your best for your... [straining] honey-bunny snuggle-baby.
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,cheerilee,Oh! Dress!
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,sweetie belle,Now we just need to keep them apart. I'll keep Miss Cheerilee occupied. You two do the same with Big Mac.
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,No problem.
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,sweetie belle,Meet you back at the clubhouse in an hour when this whole mess is over.
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,sweetie belle,This one looks nice. Better try it on though.
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,sweetie belle,"Ten minutes down, fifty minutes to go."
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,No.
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,No.
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,Not that one either.
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,No.
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,"Too... shiny. No. You know, somethin' less... shiny."
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,Miss Cheerilee deserves the best. How much time is left? I'm runnin' out of ways to make diamonds sound bad.
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,scootaloo,We still have twenty five minutes.
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,[sigh] [anxious] Where's my brother?
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,scootaloo,Ugh.
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,"Okay, I'll see what I can do to slow him down. You go on to Carousel Boutique and warn Sweetie Belle."
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,Huh<U+0096>
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,sweetie belle,What's wrong? Where's Apple Bloom? Where's Big Mac?
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,scootaloo,On [gasp] his [grunt] way. Gotta [grunt] keep him [gasp] out of boutique.
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,Huh?
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,scootaloo,Move away!
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,He'll get to her! He's too strong!
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,sweetie belle,Let him go!
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,big mcintosh,Shmoopy-doo<U+0096> Whoa!
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,scootaloo,[sigh] I sure am glad you found those shovels.
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,One more minute and the spell will be broken!
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,big mcintosh,Shmoopy-doo!
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,cheerilee,Sweetums?!
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,big mcintosh,Shmoopy-doo!
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,Aaaa<U+0096>
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,"Oh, please be normal, please be normal."
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,cheerilee,Am I wearing a wedding veil?
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,big mcintosh,Eeyup.
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,cheerilee,Are you sitting on a feather bed in a hole in the ground?
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,big mcintosh,Eeyup.
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,cheerilee,Girls! Can you explain why I look like I'm getting married at the bottom of a pit?
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,sweetie belle,"We may have given you the teeny-tiniest bit of love potion... that may have turned out to actually be a love poison, and you may have gone just a teeny-tiniest bit nutty."
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,But we only did it because we thought you and Big Mac would be really happy if you could be each others very special someponies on Hearts and Hooves Day.
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,scootaloo,Our hearts and hooves were in the right place.
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,cheerilee,We appreciate that you care about us and want us to be happy but<U+0096>
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,"But no matter how good our intentions might have been, we shoulda never meddled in your relationship."
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,scootaloo,Nopony can force two ponies to be together.
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,sweetie belle,It's up to everypony to choose that very special somepony for themselves.
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,cheerilee,And you can think about how sorry you are while you're doing all of Big Mac's chores at Sweet Apple Acres. Does that seem like a fair punishment to you?
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,big mcintosh,Eeyup.
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,"Hey there, Miss Cheerilee! What are you doin' here?"
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,cheerilee,"Since you three are doing all of his chores, Big Mac and I thought we'd have a picnic at the gazebo. Ready, sugar bear?"
Hearts and Hooves Day,Meghan McCarthy,big mcintosh,"Eeyup, pumpkin pie."
A Friend in Deed,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,Let's do this!
A Friend in Deed,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,Nailed it!
A Friend in Deed,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"Morning, DaisyJo! You here to pick up some cookies to go with your milk?"

A Friend in Deed,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,One more time...!

A Friend in Deed,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"C'mon now, Doodle, give a smile!"

A Friend in Deed,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"What just happened? Meet somepony new, check. Introduce myself, check. Sing random song outta nowhere, check. Become instant best friends... uncheck. I don't get it. How can somepony not become instant best friends with me? Was it something I said? Was it something I sang? This is no time for the blame game, Pinkie! There's somepony new in town, and you need to win him over! 'Try everything you can to make Cranky smile and be your friend'... Check!"
A Friend in Deed,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"Alright, Pinkie. If you're gonna win Cranky's friendship, you're gonna have to bring your A game! Let's do this. Howdy-doody, Cranky Doodle! So, uh, are you moving to Ponyville, Cranky?"
A Friend in Deed,Amy Keating Rogers,cranky doodle donkey,"What gave you the hint there, kid? The cart full of stuff, maybe?"
A Friend in Deed,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"Well, I'd be happy to show you around. It's the least a new friend can do."
A Friend in Deed,Amy Keating Rogers,cranky doodle donkey,"Listen, kid, I traveled around Equestria my entire life. I've made many friends. I don't need any more."
A Friend in Deed,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,Gosh! I could never have too many friends!
A Friend in Deed,Amy Keating Rogers,cranky doodle donkey,"Well, why don't you go and make some more?"
A Friend in Deed,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,But I don't need to go when I can stay and make friends... with you.
A Friend in Deed,Amy Keating Rogers,cranky doodle donkey,"Look, kid, y<U+0096>"
A Friend in Deed,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"Oh, Cranky, you can call me Pinkie. All of my friends do."
A Friend in Deed,Amy Keating Rogers,cranky doodle donkey,"Look, kid, I came to Ponyville for some peace and quiet and privacy, to be alone with my memories. All I want is to get to my new home and unpack my stuff."
A Friend in Deed,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"Ooh, what does this bauble do?"
A Friend in Deed,Amy Keating Rogers,cranky doodle donkey,Don't touch that!
A Friend in Deed,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"Ooooooh, what's this?"

A Friend in Deed,Amy Keating Rogers,cranky doodle donkey,"Oh, where is it, where is it?"
A Friend in Deed,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,Where's what? [yelps] Spider! Big hairy spider!
A Friend in Deed,Amy Keating Rogers,cranky doodle donkey,"Stop, stop, stop!"
A Friend in Deed,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,Oh. Was that your wig?
A Friend in Deed,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"I can fix this, I can fix this! [through megaphone] Hey, everypony! Does anypony have a toupee?!"
A Friend in Deed,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"This donkey is really, really, bald!"
A Friend in Deed,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"[through megaphone] What's so funny? This is serious business, everypony! Cranky needs a new wig to cover his hairless head!"
A Friend in Deed,Amy Keating Rogers,cranky doodle donkey,I have had enough!
A Friend in Deed,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"Oh, you're losing him, Pinkie. Wait, Cranky! Please, let me make it up to you!"
A Friend in Deed,Amy Keating Rogers,cranky doodle donkey,No!
A Friend in Deed,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"Ladies, this is a spa emergency. Cranky needs help, STAT."
A Friend in Deed,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"Hi, Cranky! I have a gift for you!"
A Friend in Deed,Amy Keating Rogers,cranky doodle donkey,The spa treatment was gift enough.
A Friend in Deed,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"It's not going to explode or anything. Promise. Just open it! It's a new toupee! I had my friend Rarity make it. She calls it the ""dreamboat special""."
A Friend in Deed,Amy Keating Rogers,cranky doodle donkey,"This is wonderful. Thanks, kid."
A Friend in Deed,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"He's starting to warm up, but still no smile. Hmmm."
A Friend in Deed,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"Hey! Whatcha doing there, ol' buddy ol' pal?"
A Friend in Deed,Amy Keating Rogers,cranky doodle donkey,What's it look like?
A Friend in Deed,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,Looks like a yard sale. I'll give you two bits for this!
A Friend in Deed,Amy Keating Rogers,cranky doodle donkey,"I'm not selling, kid. I'm unpacking."
A Friend in Deed,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"Well, why didn't you say so?"
A Friend in Deed,Amy Keating Rogers,cranky doodle donkey,I thought I had.
A Friend in Deed,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,This is so pretty! Where'd you get it?
A Friend in Deed,Amy Keating Rogers,cranky doodle donkey,"Manehattan. Now put it down, gently."
A Friend in Deed,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,Really? What were you doin' there?
A Friend in Deed,Amy Keating Rogers,cranky doodle donkey,Trying to find a friend.
A Friend in Deed,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"Oooh, I'm always trying to find friends, and today I found you. See how good I am at it?"
A Friend in Deed,Amy Keating Rogers,cranky doodle donkey,This was a special friend.
A Friend in Deed,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,Like me?
A Friend in Deed,Amy Keating Rogers,cranky doodle donkey,"No, you're extra special, kid."
A Friend in Deed,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"[to herself] Yes! I'm in! [to Cranky] Woow, where in Equestria did you get this, Cranky?"
A Friend in Deed,Amy Keating Rogers,cranky doodle donkey,Fillydelphia.
A Friend in Deed,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,It's awfully pretty.
A Friend in Deed,Amy Keating Rogers,cranky doodle donkey,"Yes, she was."
A Friend in Deed,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,Huh?
A Friend in Deed,Amy Keating Rogers,cranky doodle donkey,"I mean, it was<U+0096> I mean, it is. Yes, it's pretty. Now put it down!"
A Friend in Deed,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"I wonder where Cranky got this. Huh. Will you look at that? Hey, Cranky! Can I ask you about<U+0096>"
A Friend in Deed,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,Oh no!
A Friend in Deed,Amy Keating Rogers,cranky doodle donkey,What did you say-ayayayayay! What have you done?!
A Friend in Deed,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"There! Uh, all better?"
A Friend in Deed,Amy Keating Rogers,cranky doodle donkey,"No, not all better, all soggy!"
A Friend in Deed,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"I'm sorry, Cranky!"
A Friend in Deed,Amy Keating Rogers,cranky doodle donkey,"Oh, you're sorry! Well, then, everything is fine!"
A Friend in Deed,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,...It is?
A Friend in Deed,Amy Keating Rogers,cranky doodle donkey,"No! It isn't! Listen to me, kid, I will never be your friend!"
A Friend in Deed,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"Never, or never-ever?"
A Friend in Deed,Amy Keating Rogers,cranky doodle donkey,"Never, ever, ever, ever, ever!"
A Friend in Deed,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,That's four 'evers'. That's like... forever!
A Friend in Deed,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,I just can't believe it. Cranky said he would never forever be my friend. It was horrible.
A Friend in Deed,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"I know this is hard for you, Pinkie, seeing that you're friends with everypony, but you just have to accept that Cranky is gonna be an exception. He just... doesn't want to be bothered."

A Friend in Deed,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,Cranky!
A Friend in Deed,Amy Keating Rogers,cranky doodle donkey,No! No! Leave me alone!
A Friend in Deed,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,Wait! I understand that you don't want me as a friend!
A Friend in Deed,Amy Keating Rogers,cranky doodle donkey,"No, I don't!"
A Friend in Deed,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,So I just wanted to say 'I'm sorry'!

A Friend in Deed,Amy Keating Rogers,cranky doodle donkey,No!
A Friend in Deed,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"Oh, Cranky! Please accept my apology! Please!"

A Friend in Deed,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"Cranky, please, please accept my apology! I'd do anything to make it up to you!"
A Friend in Deed,Amy Keating Rogers,cranky doodle donkey,But there's nothing you can do! You ruined my book! You destroyed all I have to remember her by!
A Friend in Deed,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,Her? Her who? The special friend?
A Friend in Deed,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"[muffled] Cranky? It's me again. I understand that you don't wanna be my friend or accept my apology... Before I leave you alone forever, I have something to at least try to make up for ruining your book."
A Friend in Deed,Amy Keating Rogers,cranky doodle donkey,"No, I don't want it, kid! Anything you would give me is sure to lead to some sort of disaster!"
A Friend in Deed,Amy Keating Rogers,matilda,"[muffled] Goodness, you really are cranky."
A Friend in Deed,Amy Keating Rogers,cranky doodle donkey,It can't be... Is it really you?
A Friend in Deed,Amy Keating Rogers,matilda,"It can, and it is."
A Friend in Deed,Amy Keating Rogers,cranky doodle donkey,Matilda! But how?
A Friend in Deed,Amy Keating Rogers,matilda,Pinkie.
A Friend in Deed,Amy Keating Rogers,cranky doodle donkey,But... I never told you about her!
A Friend in Deed,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,You didn't have to. I put two and two and two together and it added up to Matilda.
A Friend in Deed,Amy Keating Rogers,cranky doodle donkey,What?
A Friend in Deed,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"Well, when you were talking about your souvenirs, you said something about trying to find a special friend! And y'know, I wasn't just born yesterday. Nuh-uh! My birthday isn't for another seventy five days!"
A Friend in Deed,Amy Keating Rogers,cranky doodle donkey,Huh?
A Friend in Deed,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"And then, in your scrapbook, there was a flower, an old ticket, and a menu from the Grand Galloping Gala! And I knew I recognized all these things."
A Friend in Deed,Amy Keating Rogers,cranky doodle donkey,But how could you have ever seen them before?
A Friend in Deed,Amy Keating Rogers,matilda,Because I also have them in my scrapbook.
A Friend in Deed,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,And I'd seen them in Matilda's book!
A Friend in Deed,Amy Keating Rogers,cranky doodle donkey,"Oh, Matilda. The night we met at the Gala was the most magical night of my life."
A Friend in Deed,Amy Keating Rogers,cranky doodle donkey,"[voiceover] I couldn't wait to see you again. But when I came to your room the next day, you were gone."
A Friend in Deed,Amy Keating Rogers,matilda,[voiceover] Didn't you get my note?
A Friend in Deed,Amy Keating Rogers,cranky doodle donkey,"[voiceover] No, I never got it. Ever since that day I've gone from town to town to town, searching all over Equestria for you..."
A Friend in Deed,Amy Keating Rogers,cranky doodle donkey,...Until finally I gave up. I came to Ponyville to retire from my search.
A Friend in Deed,Amy Keating Rogers,matilda,I was living in Ponyville the whole time. I always hoped that some day you would come and find me... Doodle.
A Friend in Deed,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,Uh. Matilda? Nopony calls him Doodle.
A Friend in Deed,Amy Keating Rogers,cranky doodle donkey,Nopony... but Matilda. Mmm.
A Friend in Deed,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,So does this mean that you accept my apology?
A Friend in Deed,Amy Keating Rogers,cranky doodle donkey,"Yes, Pinkie, I accept your apology, and I am honored to call you my friend."
A Friend in Deed,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"[explodes like a firework] Woo-hoo! This is just fantastic! Ooh, now we can hang out together and chat and sing songs and [gasps] party! Oh, I have to throw you guys a big party! It'll be called the 'Welcome to Ponyville/I Found My Lost Love/I'm BFF's with Pinkie Pie' Party! ...Or maybe something less over-the-top and not so super-hyper."
A Friend in Deed,Amy Keating Rogers,cranky doodle donkey,"Pinkie, we're eternally grateful to you. But... Matilda and I just want to spend some time together in peace and quiet."
A Friend in Deed,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"Oh. Um, but we're still friends?"
A Friend in Deed,Amy Keating Rogers,cranky doodle donkey,"Pinkie, you went way, way, way out of your way to make me happy. Of course we're friends."
A Friend in Deed,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,Great!
A Friend in Deed,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"Dear Princess Celestia,"
A Friend in Deed,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"There are many different kinds of friends, and many ways to express friendship. Some friends like to run and laugh and play together. But others just like to be left alone, and that's fine too. But the best thing about friendship is being able to make your friends smile."
A Friend in Deed,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"He had a Cranky Doodle sweetheart She's his cranky doodle joy I helped the Cranky Doodle boy, yeah! I helped the Cranky Doodle boy!"
A Friend in Deed,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"Whoops, privacy. Sorry."

Putting Your Hoof Down,Merriwether Williams; story by Charlotte Fullerton,pinkie pie,What do you think you're doing?
Putting Your Hoof Down,Merriwether Williams; story by Charlotte Fullerton,pinkie pie,Two bits for tomatoes is outrageous. One bit is the right price.

Putting Your Hoof Down,Merriwether Williams; story by Charlotte Fullerton,fluttershy,But... I was only doing what you did.
Putting Your Hoof Down,Merriwether Williams; story by Charlotte Fullerton,rarity,"It was a valiant effort, but you should refuse to give him your business and just walk away."
Putting Your Hoof Down,Merriwether Williams; story by Charlotte Fullerton,fluttershy,But... I can't let Angel starve! He won't eat it unless I make it just right! I need that cherry no matter what it costs!
Putting Your Hoof Down,Merriwether Williams; story by Charlotte Fullerton,fluttershy,"Twenty?! Oh, but, I don't have that much!"
Putting Your Hoof Down,Merriwether Williams; story by Charlotte Fullerton,fluttershy,"Ta-da! Here you go, Angel. Sorry there's no cherry on top, but the rest of it is exactly what you wanted. Angel?

Putting Your Hoof Down,Merriwether Williams; story by Charlotte Fullerton,rarity,"No, sweetie, he didn't. We saw the whole thing. We think that you've taken your assertiveness training a little too far."
Putting Your Hoof Down,Merriwether Williams; story by Charlotte Fullerton,fluttershy,What?! You just want new Fluttershy to be a doormat like old Fluttershy! But old Fluttershy is gone!
Putting Your Hoof Down,Merriwether Williams; story by Charlotte Fullerton,pinkie pie,New Fluttershy? Old Fluttershy!?

Putting Your Hoof Down,Merriwether Williams; story by Charlotte Fullerton,rarity,"Now, stop right there! Let's not let things descend into petty insults!"
Putting Your Hoof Down,Merriwether Williams; story by Charlotte Fullerton,fluttershy,"Why not? I thought 'petty' was what you're all about, Rarity. With your 'petty' concerns about fashion."
Putting Your Hoof Down,Merriwether Williams; story by Charlotte Fullerton,pinkie pie,"Hey, leave her alone! Fashion is her passion!"
Putting Your Hoof Down,Merriwether Williams; story by Charlotte Fullerton,fluttershy,"Oh, and what are you passionate about? Birthday cake? Party hats? I can't believe that the two most frivolous ponies in Ponyville are trying to tell new Fluttershy how to live her life when they are throwing their own lives away on pointless pursuits that nopony else gives a flying feather about!"

Putting Your Hoof Down,Merriwether Williams; story by Charlotte Fullerton,fluttershy,"[muffled] Pinkie's right. I'm the only one to blame. [normal] But don't worry, I'm never coming out of my house again. Everypony will be a lot safer with me and my mean mouth locked away."
Putting Your Hoof Down,Merriwether Williams; story by Charlotte Fullerton,rarity,"[muffled] Sweetie, [normal] Pinkie Pie doesn't blame you, nor do I. You just received some bad advice from that Iron Will character."
Putting Your Hoof Down,Merriwether Williams; story by Charlotte Fullerton,pinkie pie,"Yeah! He's the one that made you act super-duper nasty. What I mean is, there are other ways to assert yourself besides yelling at everypony."
Putting Your Hoof Down,Merriwether Williams; story by Charlotte Fullerton,rarity,Yes! [muffled] You can stand up for yourself without being unpleasant about it.
Putting Your Hoof Down,Merriwether Williams; story by Charlotte Fullerton,fluttershy,"I-I'm not sure I can. I'm too far gone. Whenever I try to assert myself, I become a monster."
Putting Your Hoof Down,Merriwether Williams; story by Charlotte Fullerton,rarity,"Oh, sweetie, you're not a monster."

Putting Your Hoof Down,Merriwether Williams; story by Charlotte Fullerton,rarity,Do something!
Putting Your Hoof Down,Merriwether Williams; story by Charlotte Fullerton,pinkie pie,"We're not even sure Fluttershy is home right now. Uh, she might be off frolicking with some woodland creatures. Uh, why don't you give us some time to track her down for ya?"

Putting Your Hoof Down,Merriwether Williams; story by Charlotte Fullerton,fluttershy,"Um, no."
Putting Your Hoof Down,Merriwether Williams; story by Charlotte Fullerton,iron will,What did you say?
Putting Your Hoof Down,Merriwether Williams; story by Charlotte Fullerton,fluttershy,No.
Putting Your Hoof Down,Merriwether Williams; story by Charlotte Fullerton,fluttershy,"As I recall, during your workshop you promised one hundred percent satisfaction guaranteed, or you pay nothing. Well, I'm not satisfied."
Putting Your Hoof Down,Merriwether Williams; story by Charlotte Fullerton,iron will,What do you mean you're not satisfied?! Everypony has always been satisfied!
Putting Your Hoof Down,Merriwether Williams; story by Charlotte Fullerton,fluttershy,"Well, I guess I'm the first then. But since I'm not satisfied, I refuse to pay. It's as simple as that."
Putting Your Hoof Down,Merriwether Williams; story by Charlotte Fullerton,iron will,"Ohh, are you... sure you're not just a little bit satisfied? B-because maybe... we could cut a deal. I-I mean we're both reasonable creatures, aren't we?"
Putting Your Hoof Down,Merriwether Williams; story by Charlotte Fullerton,fluttershy,"I'm sorry, but no means no."
Putting Your Hoof Down,Merriwether Williams; story by Charlotte Fullerton,iron will,"No means no, huh? Nopony's ever said that to me before. Huh... I gotta remember that one. That's a good catchphrase for my next workshop."
Putting Your Hoof Down,Merriwether Williams; story by Charlotte Fullerton,pinkie pie,"You were amazing, Fluttershy! You totally stood up to that monster!"
Putting Your Hoof Down,Merriwether Williams; story by Charlotte Fullerton,rarity,"In fact, you didn't change at all! You were the same old Fluttershy that we've always loved!"
Putting Your Hoof Down,Merriwether Williams; story by Charlotte Fullerton,pinkie pie,The one we missed!
Putting Your Hoof Down,Merriwether Williams; story by Charlotte Fullerton,fluttershy,"Don't worry, old Fluttershy's back for good. I'm sorry I took the whole assertiveness thing too far. Friends?"
Putting Your Hoof Down,Merriwether Williams; story by Charlotte Fullerton,fluttershy,"Dear Princess Celestia,"
Putting Your Hoof Down,Merriwether Williams; story by Charlotte Fullerton,fluttershy,"Sometimes it can be hard for a shy pony like me to stand up for myself, and when I first tried it, I didn't like the pony I became. But I've learned that standing up for yourself isn't the same as changing who you are. Now I know how to put my hoof down without being unpleasant or mean."
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,spike,"[sighs] I made it for you, Rarity. Why, yes, it is an ice cream house. Chocolate fudge shingles... rocky road garage..."
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,spike,Huh? Twilight?
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Oh, hi, Spike!"
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,spike,It's the middle of the night! Why are you pacing like this?
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Frankly, I don't know how you can sleep at a time like this!"
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,spike,Three A.M.?
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"It's awful, it's horrible, it's tragic!"
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,spike,Eh... I don't understand. What's wrong?
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,Here. Now do you see what's wrong?
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,spike,We forgot to celebrate Arbor Day?
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"No, the problem is I just finished planning my schedule for the month, but I forgot to leave time to plan for next month! Don't you see? There's no time in my schedule to put together another schedule! I could move my meeting with the Ponyville Hay Board to the following Tuesday, but then I have to reschedule my lunch with Pinkie Pie, and you know what a nightmare she is with scheduling. This is an absolute disaster. My whole year could be thrown off!"
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,spike,And I woke up from an ice cream dream for this...
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Oh, my gosh, I think I did it! If I can find a way to read ""The Art of Invisibility Spells"" and ""Thornhoof's Brief History of Canterlot"" at the same time, that could leave me a half-hour scheduling window! Huh?"
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Who are you? I mean, you're me, but I'm me too. How can there be two me's? It's not scientifically possible. You are not scientifically possible!"
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,You're from the future?!
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,What happened to you? The future must be awful.
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,Is there some sort of epic pony war in the distant future or something?
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"I can't believe time travel is really possible! How did you, I mean, I figure it out?"
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,Really? Where? I've never seen them.
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,"C'mon, Fluttershy! The party can't start until the party supplies get there!"
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,[grunts] Happy to... help... but... can I carry... the balloons next time?
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,Oh!
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Listen, everypony! I've got something really important to say!"
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,This is no laughing matter! We have a crisis on our hooves!
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,I've just been visited by myself from the future!
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,This isn't a joke! My future self tried to warn me about a horrible disaster that's going to occur sometime before next Tuesday morning!
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,applejack,What kind of disaster?
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,I don't know! I got sucked back into the future before I could explain!
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,Run for your liiiiiiiife!
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,rarity,"What ever should we do, Twilight? How do we stop the disaster if we don't know what it is?"
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"We'll just have to work together to make sure we're safe. Rainbow Dash, you and the other Pegasi spread out over Equestria, and look for any kind of problem that could lead to a disaster, and I mean anything."
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,You got it!
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,Everypony else<U+0096>
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Everypony else, time to disaster-proof Equestria!"
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,big mcintosh,Eeyup.
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Done, and done, and done. Applejack, what about the Everfree Forest?"
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,applejack,The perimeter's clear.
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,Great.
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,And my team gave the all clear from Fillydelphia to Las Pegasus.
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Excellent. Well, we've done everything on the list, but still... Future Twilight looked like she'd been through a horrible ordeal. I just have this nagging feeling we should be looking for something bigger than loose bolts and leaky pipes."
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,spike,What is that thing?!
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"That's Cerberus! He's supposed to be guarding the gates of Tartarus. But if he's here, then all the ancient evil creatures that have been imprisoned there could escape and destroy Equestria!"
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,spike,Destroy Equestria?!
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Yeah! Isn't it great? Hey, Cerberus! You look like you could use some obedience training! Magic obedience training!"
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,Huh?
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,Who's the cute widdle three-headed dog?
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Wow, I knew you were good with animals, but this is amazing!"
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,"Aww, he's just a big furry guy who got out of his yard, that's all. Right, Cerberus? Who's a good boy? Who's a good boy?"
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,Pinkie.
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,"[stops screaming] Yes, Twilight?"
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,Do you have a ball I can borrow?
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,"I have balls stashed all over Ponyville, in case of ball emergency."
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"[sing-song voice] Hey, Cerberus! Look what I have!"
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"I'll be back as soon as I've returned him to the gates of Tartarus. Once he's back at home, there'll be no disaster."
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,spike,[yawns] I wish Twilight would go on epic adventures more often. Best night's sleep I've had in weeks.
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,spike,"Hey, Twilight. How'd it go with Cerberus?"
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,Great. I got him back before any of the evil creatures could escape.
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,[yelps] Oh no!
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,spike,"What's the big deal, it's just a 'lost dog' flyer. I guess the Princess hasn't heard we found Cerberus yet."
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"It's not that, it's this!"
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,spike,"A paper cut? Come on, Twilight, you really need to toughen up. Just clean it out and you'll be fine."
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,The cut's in the exact same spot as the scar on future Twilight's cheek! We haven't changed the future at all! The disaster is still coming!
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"If the disaster wasn't caused by Cerberus getting loose, then what could it possibly be?"
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,spike,"[laughs] I dunno, but maybe you ought to give the pacing a rest. You've worn a groove into the floor!"
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"I don't have time for another one of your lectures, Spike! This is serious!"
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,spike,My lectures?
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,I did everything I could think of to change the future. But it didn't work. So maybe it's not what I do... Maybe it's what I don't do!
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,spike,Huh?
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"If I stand right here and don't move a muscle until next Tuesday, I can't possibly do whatever it is that future Twilight wanted to warn me not to do!"
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,spike,"Really? So... no matter what happens, you're not gonna move a muscle, huh? Then maybe you won't mind if I... eat an entire tub of ice cream!"
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"[through gritted teeth] Spike, stop! Think of the stomach ache!"
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,spike,"[chuckles] Stomach ache, huh? That's future Spike's problem."
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,"Hey, Twilight, another Pegasus just got back from Baltimare with an all-clear and<U+0096> [laughs] What's going on? Aren't you gonna stop him?"
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,spike,"She sure isn't! In fact, she's not gonna move 'til next Tuesday! She thinks it'll prevent the disaster from happening!"
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,"[laughs] Oh, this is too rich. [gasps] Hey, Twilight! There's a mouse right behind you!"
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,Oh no!
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,What happened?
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,spike,I'm so sorry! I didn't mean to! It was a total accident!
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,Show me.
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,Uhhh... I'm not so sure that's a<U+0096>
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,Show me! Oh no! This is the same mane cut as future Twilight!
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,Y'know... it really doesn't look too bad...
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"I don't care how it looks! It's just another sign that the future hasn't changed! Not doing anything didn't work either! Oh, I wish there was a way to know what was going to happen so I could stop it!"
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,spike,You wanna see the future? I might know somepony who can help!
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,What's this?
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,spike,It's Madame Pinkie's place.
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,Madame Pinkie?
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,"[spookily] Come... Enter the chamber of Madame Pinkie Pie... For the answers you seek, let us consult the mystical orb of fate's destiny... [normal] Do you like my mystical orb of fate's destiny? I just got it. Cool, huh?"
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Yeah, uh... best one I've seen."
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,"[spookily] Look deep into the crystal ball... for soon it will reveal all! Ah, yes, I see something... It is a vision of the future... I see... you, Twilight. You will get a really cool birthday present next year..."
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Yes, and?"
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,That's it.
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,Are you sure?
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,Yep. Cool birthday present.
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Pinkie, I need your Pinkie Sense to tell me what the impending disaster is that future Twilight was trying to warn me about!"
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,"Oh, my fortunetelling has nothing to do with my Pinkie Sense, silly. It's only good for vague and immediate events."
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,"Like that, see? Where did that even come from?"
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,"Lalalalalalala, lalalala... Gosh, I haven't seen Twilight since the flowerpot incident. Hope she still isn't mad. Uhhhh..."
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,Off by point zero two from yesterday. Carry the fifteen... Negative azimuth on the fourteenth moon...
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,spike,Hey Pinkie.
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,"Twilight's really serious about finding out about that cool birthday present, isn't she?"
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,spike,"Who cares? As long as I can keep eating ice cream. Sorry, future Spike."
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,[to Twilight] Are... you okay?
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Ah, Pinkie, I'm glad you're here. Can you help me recalibrate the apertures on the nine-and-quarter catadioptric telescopes?"
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,Sure!
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"So I was thinking, after I came to see Madame Pinkie and the flowerpot landed on my head<U+0097>see the bandage? Just like the bandage from the future..."
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,Nice!
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"I had an epiphany after that flowerpot. Doing things didn't work, not doing things didn't work, and I couldn't predict the future either, so I only had one other choice. Monitor everything."
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,Makes sense to me!
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"That way no matter what happens in the future, I'll be ready! I thought I saw something last night in the Horsehead Nebula, but after staring at it for three straight hours I realized, I was wrong!"
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,Three hours? But when did you sleep?
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Oh, I didn't sleep. I haven't slept since future Twilight was here. There are only three days left until next Tuesday, I can sleep all I want after that!"
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,spike,"You've been awake too long, Twilight."
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,"Yeah. Tuesday's not three days from now, Tuesday's tomorrow!"
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"[gasps] Pinkie, did you finish recalibrating the apertures on the nine-and-quarter-inch catadioptric telescopes?"
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,I have no idea!
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,Ah! My eye!
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,"Don't worry, Twilight, I have eye patches stashed all over Ponyville, in case of eye patch emergency. There! Now you look like a pirate! A sleepy pirate, with a really weird mane cut."
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"The eye patch...! Another sign! Nearly all the signs have come true! I haven't done a thing to prevent the catastrophe! If Tuesday's tomorrow, and the disaster happens by Tuesday morning, then there's only one solution. I'll just have to... stop time!"
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"[hushed] Okay, the Canterlot archives are right over there. Let's move!"
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,spike,"Uhh... I don't think we need to sneak around, Twilight. It's not illegal to walk around Canterlot."
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"[hushed] Guard! C'mon, you guys! [exhales] That was close."
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,spike,"I dunno why we have to wear these things, either."
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,Aren't we wearing them for fun?
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"[hushed] No, there's nothing fun about this!"
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,Oh... Are you sure?
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"[hushed] Focus, guys! The only way to prevent this disaster is to stop time! Time spells are kept in the Star Swirl the Bearded wing, the most secure section of the archives. That's why we're sneaking around!"
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,Awesome! That sounds fun!
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"[hushed] No, it's not fun!"
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,Aww.
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,I still don't understand how sneaking into the archives is gonna help her find out about her birthday present.
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,[hushed] The coast is clear. Now slowly lift me into the window so we can<U+0096> AH!
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,spike,[sighs] Let's get this over with.
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"[hushed] Okay, if my calculations are correct, the Star Swirl the Bearded wing should be right... here."
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,spike,"Uh, Twilight?"
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"[hushed] What is it, Spike?"
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,spike,Isn't this where we came in?
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,Cool! Can we climb in the window again? That was super fun!
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,I don't understand. It's supposed to be right here... How are we supposed to find it now?
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,Maybe we should ask somepony in the Star Swirl the Bearded wing?
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,Huh. How'd I miss that? Look at all those priceless magic scrolls. There are more than I ever imagined!
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,"Twilight, the guard!"
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"[gasps] What do we do, what do we do?!"
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,[chuckles nervously] Thanks!
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,Oh no!
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,spike,Oof!
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,Oh!
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,Look! I look just like future Twilight... The last sign has come true!
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,"And that's bad, right?"
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,Come on! It's almost Tuesday morning! The disaster could happen at any moment!
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,spike,But how do we find the time-stopping spell? There must be a million scrolls here!
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,I. Don't. Know!
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,spike,"Twilight, it's over! It's officially Tuesday morning."
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Nnngh, no! Tuesday morning, the disaster! Incoming!"
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,spike,"I dunno, Twilight. I don't see any disasters. Looks like a pretty nice day."
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,princess celestia,"Good morning, Twilight. Love the new hairstyle. Well, happy Tuesday!"
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,Why isn't anypony surprised to see me sneaking around in here?! Is it possible there never was a disaster? That I've just been making myself frantic over nothing?!
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,spike,"I don't get it. If future Twilight wasn't warning you about a disaster, then what was she trying to tell you?"
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,[giggles] I don't know. But I do know one thing. I look ridiculous.
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,spike,"Yeah, you do!"
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"And it's all because I couldn't stop worrying and let the future handle itself! Well, not anymore. From now on, I'm gonna solve problems as they come, and stop worrying about every little thing!"
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,spike,That's great! Does that mean there won't be any more late night pacing?
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"No more late night pacing. If only I had learned this lesson a week ago, we wouldn't have had to go through all this."
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,"Twilight, Twilight, I found something! It doesn't stop time, but it lets you go back in time. It says you can go back once, and it only lasts for a few moments. Does that help?"
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Pinkie, you're a genius!"
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,Woo-hoo!
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,Now I can go back and tell past Twilight that she doesn't need to go berserk with worry about a disaster that's never gonna come!
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Twilight, you've got to listen to me!"
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Twilight, please! I have a very important message for you from the future!"
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"That's right, now listen<U+0096>"
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,Please! I don't have much time!
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Actually, I'm from next Tuesday morning, but that's not important right now!"
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,The time spells are in the Canterlot archives. But that's not<U+0096>
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"They're in the Star Swirl the Bearded wing. Now, you have to listen to<U+0096>"
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"I have something extremely important to tell you about the future, and I only have a few seconds, so you've got to listen! Whatever you do, don't<U+0096>"
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,<U+0096>waste your time... worrying... about... Ugh! I can't believe I just did that!
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,Did you tell her about the cool birthday present?
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,Remember last week when future Twilight came to warn me about something? That was me trying to warn myself not to worry so much! Now I'm gonna spend the next week freaking out about a disaster that doesn't even exist! Ugh...
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,"Ah, don't worry about it. It's past Twilight's problem now."
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"[giggles] Huh, I guess you're right, Pinkie."
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,spike,"[stomach growls] Ohhh... my stomach... I, I think it's all that ice cream... I thought the stomach ache would be future Spike's problem... but now I am future Spike. Ohh..."
It's About Time,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Come on, future Spike. Let's get you home."
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,twilight sparkle,"C'mon, Fluttershy, it'll be fun!"
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,fluttershy,"There's nothing fun about dragons! Scary, yes! Fun, no!"
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,twilight sparkle,"But Fluttershy, the great dragon migration happens only once in a generation! Do you really wanna pass up a chance like that?"
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,fluttershy,"Now that you put it that way, yes!"
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,twilight sparkle,"Aw, Fluttershy, we just don't want you to miss out."
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,fluttershy,"Miss out on what? Dragons? Big, scaly, fire-breathing dragons?"
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,twilight sparkle,Well... yeah!
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,fluttershy,"Thanks, but... no thanks!"
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,"Look, Fluttershy, I watched that boring butterfly migration with you, so now it's your turn to watch the dragon migration with me! You owe me!"
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,fluttershy,I... said... no!
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,Yeaagh! Ugh!
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,"Okay, I guess I'll let you off the hook this time."
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,twilight sparkle,[hushed] I don't see any dragons.
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,applejack,[hushed] Me neither.
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,pinkie pie,Me neither neither.
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,"Shoot! You don't think we missed them, do you?"
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,twilight sparkle,"[hushed] No, I don't think so. We're just a little early, and I'm glad we are. This way, we can watch every moment of the migration without bringing any unwanted attention to ourselves!"
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,rarity,Yoo-hoo! Well?
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,rarity,What do you think? Am I the toast of the trench or what?
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,applejack,"[hushed] You'll be toast alright, when the dragons see you parading around in that getup."
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,twilight sparkle,"[hushed] You look very nice, Rarity, but could you maybe look nice down here in the trench with us?"
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,rarity,Nice is an understatement. I look fabulous! Who says camouflage has to be drab?
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,pinkie pie,"[hushed] Ahoy, maties! Dragons ho!"
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,twilight sparkle,"Wow, amazing!"
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,"Pfft, pretty lame move. Is that all they've got?"
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,applejack,"[hushed] What do ya think of that 'move', Rainbow Dash? Still think they're lame?"
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,"[hushed] Uh, not so much. The word 'fierce' comes to mind."
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,rarity,[hushed] And 'formidable'.
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,pinkie pie,[hushed] And 'super-duper scary'!
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,spike,Yeah. Us dragons are definitely a force to be reckoned with.
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,"[laughs] Yeah, right, Spike. That's one of the scariest aprons I've ever seen!"
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,spike,What's wrong with wearing an apron? You won't be laughing when you spill blueberries all over your scales. Feathers. That's one tough stain!
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,rarity,"You leave him alone, Rainbow Dash! Spike's style is unique. He doesn't have to look like other dragons."
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,twilight sparkle,Or act like them.
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,rarity,My little Spikey-wikey is perfect the way he is.
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,spike,I don't act like other dragons?
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,pinkie pie,"Oh, not even close!"
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,applejack,"But why would you want to, Spike?"
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,rarity,Yes. You've got something those dreadfully fierce dragons can only dream of.
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,spike,What's that?
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,rarity,The cutest widdle chubby cheeks! Ooooo!
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,spike,Cute?! Dragons aren't supposed to be cute! Right?
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,rarity,"Oh, sweetie, you are turning the most delightful shade of red. It is most becoming."
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,spike,Rrrgh!
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,rarity,"Oh, isn't he adorable when he waddles off in anger?"
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,spike,Waddle?! Rrrrrggggh!
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,spike,What am I? Where am I from? Who am I supposed to be?
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,twilight sparkle,"Uuugh! I don't know! For the last time, Spike, you were given to me as an egg. I don't know who found you or where they found you."
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,spike,Seriously? That's all you know?
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,twilight sparkle,"I'm sorry, Spike."
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,spike,That doesn't tell me anything about who I am! I need answers! I feel like I'm... I'm looking at a complete stranger. Oh!
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,twilight sparkle,"Oh, Spike. Why don't we do some late-night research? See what we can find out."
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,spike,Really? You'd do that?
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,twilight sparkle,Of course! I'm sure we can find something.
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,twilight sparkle,Nothing. Nothing in this one either!
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,spike,Nothing at all about dragons? This is getting ridiculous!
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,twilight sparkle,"I know! It's hard to believe, but ponies know next to nothing about dragons. Apparently they're too rare and too scary to try to talk to or study!"
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,spike,I wonder if dragons cry...
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,twilight sparkle,"Aw, Spike."
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,spike,"It's okay, Twilight. I'm gonna discover who I am if it's the last thing I do!"
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,rarity,Yoo-hoo!
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,"Hey, guys!"
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,spike,Waugh!
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,rarity,Good morning!
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,Ya wanna join us for breakfast?
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,twilight sparkle,That sounds great. I'm famished.
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,spike,Count me out. I've gotta get an early start!
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,rarity,An early start?
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,spike,Yes! I'm going on a quest of self-discovery! I need to learn what it means to be a dragon! And the only way I'm gonna do that is to join the dragon migration!
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,"Spike, that's nonsense talk! I know that you're a dragon, but those dragons mean business! They're big, and tough, and scary..."
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,spike,"And I'm small, and meek... and I like to wear aprons. See? This is exactly why I need to spend time with them."
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,All I'm saying is that you could get hurt.
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,rarity,"Darling, this time I really do have to agree with Rainbow Dash. I don't want those big, ugly, nasty dragons to hurt one little scale on your cutesy-wutesy head!"
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,spike,"I'm sorry, but I've made up my mind."
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,rarity,"Oh, uh, quick, do something! Stop him before it's too late!"
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,spike,Ngh! Hey! Give it back!
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,twilight sparkle,Hold it!
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,spike,Whoa!
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,Aaagh!
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,spike,Really?
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,Don't tell me you think he should go?
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,twilight sparkle,"Yes, Spike. I couldn't answer your questions. My books couldn't either. I understand why you want to look elsewhere. I truly believe you need to go on this quest. And we have no right to stop you."
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,rarity,I suppose not.
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,"I still say you're nutty, but hey, I've done lots of nutty things."
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,[under her breath] Rrgh.
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,twilight sparkle,"Well then, I guess this is goodbye, Spike. We can't wait to hear about it when you return."
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,"Yeah, we hope your trip<U+0096>"
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,twilight sparkle,Quest.
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,"<U+0096>your quest answers some of your pesky ""Who am I?"" questions."
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,spike,"Thanks, everypony. I know it will."
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,rarity,"Goodbye, Spikey-wikey!"
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,"Go get 'em, big guy!"
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,twilight sparkle,We have faith in you!
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,rarity,"[through her grin] We're following him, right?"
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,twilight sparkle,[through her grin] Of course.
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,spike,Ugh!
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,spike,Nngh...
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,spike,"Alright, teenage dragons! Now that's more my speed. And size."
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,"I'm telling you, we'll never pass for a real dragon!"
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,rarity,"Oh, pish-posh! This costume is fabulous, one of my finer creations."
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,twilight sparkle,"Shh! [hushed] We'll never pass if they hear three voices coming out of one dragon! Now come on, let's go!"
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,spike,"Um, excuse me? Uh, hi. I'm Spike."
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,spike,"No, it's Spike! I'm not, I mean, I'm sure about that..."
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,spike,Not exactly...
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,spike,"No, I haven't sucked my claw in months!"
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,garble,"Well, if you weren't just hatched, how come we haven't seen you around before?"
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,spike,"Oh, well, y'see, I live in Ponyville and<U+0096>"
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,garble,"Hahaha! Ponyville? That explains it! I knew there was something vaguely pony-ish about you! If I didn't know any better, I'd say you were part pony!"
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,spike,"Who, me? I'm not part pony! I'm all dragon, see? Raar!"
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,garble,Or maybe you're a pony in a dragon costume.
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,twilight sparkle,[deep voice] Aheh... yeah... hilarious.
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,spike,"Nnh, I am a real dragon!"
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,garble,"Oh, yeah? Prove it."
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,spike,Well... how?
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,garble,By acting like one! Who's up for a little belching contest?
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,garble,"You think you can beat that, Peewee?"
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,garble,"From the desk of Princess Celestia. Dear Spike, please te<U+0096> Ha! Get this, guys! Spike's pen-pals with a namby-pamby pony princess!"
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,twilight sparkle,[gasps] How can he just throw that away?! That letter could be something important!
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,"We can't worry about that now, Twilight. We're here to help Spike!"
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,twilight sparkle,"I know, I know!"
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,twilight sparkle,There's no reason to disrespect Princess Celestia that way!
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,garble,Maybe tail wrestling is more your speed.
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,spike,Uh...
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,garble,Ready... go!
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,garble,The winner!
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,spike,Good old tail wrestling...
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,rarity,We can't let little Spikey-wikey wrestle one of them! He'll get clobbered!
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,twilight sparkle,Let's go! [deep voice] I challenge Spike to a tail wrestle!
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,garble,Who's this weirdo?
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,garble,"Oh, that would explain it. Ready? Go!"
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,garble,Spike's the winner!
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,garble,"Nice going, little Spike! Maybe you are a dragon after all!"
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,spike,Yeah! Maybe I am!
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,rarity,"Rainbow Dash, I can't believe your silly plan actually worked. Ow."
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,spike,"Alright, who's next?"
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,garble,"Getting a little cocky, huh? I like that. So how about you wrestle... him! Go!"
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,spike,Whooooooooa!
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,garble,"So, Spike, you haven't exactly proven yourself as a dragon yet, have you?"
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,spike,But... I get an A for effort?
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,garble,"Huh, maybe. Let's see how you do in this next contest."
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,spike,Whaaaaa! Oof! Wha! Oah! Oof!
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,garble,King of the hoard!
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,spike,This is my chance.
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,Not so fast!
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,twilight sparkle,Oof!
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,spike,King of the ho- whoa! Oof! Uh! Nuh! Oof!
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,garble,"Looks like this is another fail for you, little Spike. Can't wait to watch you fail at lava cannonball, too."
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,garble,Whoever makes the biggest lava splash is the ultimate dragon! Geronimo!
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,spike,Nuh!
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,twilight sparkle,[hushed] Spike's on his own this time.
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,spike,Guh!
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,garble,"What's wrong, Spike? You afraid the lava will hurt your soft pony hide?"
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,spike,Ugh... Was I... that bad?
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,garble,"No, dude. That was awesome! No pony could live through a belly flop like that! [chuckles] You're one tough little dragon."
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,garble,"Spike, by belly flopping so hard, you have proven yourself worthy. I hereby dub you 'rookie dragon', and will now perform the initiation ritual. Rrrrgh. [chuckles] Now let's party dragon style!"
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,spike,"Man, was that a great party."
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,garble,"Great? Huh, maybe by Ponyville standards. Stick with us, Spike. We still got plenty to teach you about being a dragon."
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,spike,"I'm not going anywhere. The way I feel right now, I could hang out with you guys forever."
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,rarity,Spikey-wikey is going to stay with these awful dragons? Forever?
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,twilight sparkle,"Oh no, this is terrible!"
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,I should've stopped him back at the library when I had the chance!
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,twilight sparkle,"No, Rainbow Dash, this is all my fault! I encouraged him to go!"
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,garble,"Y'know, Spike, I think you just might be ready for a real dragon raid."
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,garble,"There's a nest full of phoenix eggs nearby, and we're gonna swipe 'em!"
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,spike,"Oh yeah, I'm excited. I mean, I'm psyched."
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,garble,Alright then. Let's fly!
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,spike,"Uh, sorry, guys! I guess I'll meet you back here at the crater! After the whole raid thing's over? We'll totally hang then! Whoahoa!"
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,"Oh no, they took Spike! We've gotta go after them!"
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,twilight sparkle,"[yelps] Rainbow Dash, stop! We can't fly!"
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,rarity,And you're ruining my fabulous costume!
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,"I'm sorry, but we gotta help Spike!"
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,twilight sparkle,"Well, we're just gonna have to hoof it!"
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,garble,"Alright, Spike. Since you're our rookie dragon, you get to lure the parents away from the nest."
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,spike,Heh... Lucky me...
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,garble,"Well go on, then!"
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,spike,"Hey, Mr. and Mrs. Phoenix! I was hoping I could have a word with you? Um, I'd, um, like to ask you some questions actually..."
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,garble,"[hushed] We haven't got all day, Spike!"
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,spike,"Hey, you bird brains! Come and get me!"
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,garble,What the...
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,garble,"We take the hatchlings, of course!"
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,garble,Get 'em!
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,garble,Ohh... Get them!
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,garble,[chuckles] Nnnghh...
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,garble,"Nnngh, they got away! I hate that!"
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,spike,"Huh, what have we got here? What happened?"
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,garble,They got away! Hey! You stole an egg?
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,spike,Uh...
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,garble,"Well, I guess the raid wasn't a total waste after all."
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,garble,"Nice going, Spike."
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,spike,Smash the egg?
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,spike,"No! It's just a defenseless egg, like I was! And I'm not gonna let you hurt it!"
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,garble,What did you say?
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,spike,I said no.
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,Nopony's gonna lay a claw on him!
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,twilight sparkle,That's right!
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,rarity,"Fighting's not really my thing, I'm more into fashion, but I'll rip you to pieces if you touch one scale on his cute little head!"
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,garble,"Ooh, scary, hehe! Spike, are these namby-pamby ponies your friends?"
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,spike,"Yes, they are. And they're better friends than you could ever be. Now, if you don't back off, you'll see what us ponies do when confronted by a huge group of jerky dragons."
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,garble,"Oh, yeah? [snorts] What's that?"
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,spike,Run away!
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,twilight sparkle,Nyuh!
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,spike,"Phew, that was a close one. Thanks, you guys."
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,twilight sparkle,Of course. What are friends for?
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,spike,You're more than friends. You're my family.
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,spike,"Dear Princess Celestia,"
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,spike,"Seeing the great dragon migration made me wonder what it meant to be a dragon. But now I realize that who I am is not the same as what I am. I may have been born a dragon, but Equestria and my pony friends have taught me how to be kind, loyal, and true! I'm proud to call Ponyville my home, and to have my pony friends as my family."
Dragon Quest,Merriwether Williams,spike,"Aww. [chuckles] Hey, welcome to the family, Peewee! Stick with me. I've got plenty to teach you about being a pony."
Hurricane Fluttershy,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,Calling all Pegasus ponies! Meeting tonight!
Hurricane Fluttershy,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,"Library, tonight. Be cool or be mule. No offense."
Hurricane Fluttershy,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,"All right, go on in, find a seat. Ohh... You too, Fluttershy. Come on, let's go."
Hurricane Fluttershy,Cindy Morrow,spike,Uh... intermission?
Hurricane Fluttershy,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,"So, here's the scoop. Cloudsdale has chosen our own highland reservoir as a source of the rainwater they need for all of Equestria. And you know what that means. It means it's up to Ponyville's Pegasi to bring that water up to Cloudsdale."
Hurricane Fluttershy,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,"Not only that, but Spitfire, captain of the Wonderbolts, will be here to oversee the water transfer and record our top tornado windspeed. Now last year, Fillydelphia broke the windspeed record with a top speed of nine hundred and ten wing power. But I think we can do better. I think we can get a top speed over a thousand!"
Hurricane Fluttershy,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,"...if each and every pony trains, and trains hard to get their wing power numbers up."
Hurricane Fluttershy,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,"That coughing better be from a popcorn kernel, Thunderlane. Nopony's getting sick on my watch. So, are we gonna train hard?"
Hurricane Fluttershy,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,Are we gonna be strong?
Hurricane Fluttershy,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,Are we gonna be fast?
Hurricane Fluttershy,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,Record-smashing fast?
Hurricane Fluttershy,Cindy Morrow,bulk biceps,YEAH!
Hurricane Fluttershy,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,Who's with me?
Hurricane Fluttershy,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,Fluttershy!
Hurricane Fluttershy,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,"Stretch those glutes, Flitter! Nice flexibility, Cloud Chaser. A... little too much flexibility, Blossomforth. Uh, somepony give Blossomforth a hoof. Let's see some faster trotting, Thunderlane! Good pace, Silverspeed! [blows whistle] Keep it up! We're gonna need all the wing power we can get to break that record!"
Hurricane Fluttershy,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,"Good work, everypony! [under her breath] Everypony except Fluttershy."
Hurricane Fluttershy,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,"[knocking] Fluttershy? I know you're in there! You're avoiding tornado duty and I want to know why! Fluttershy, open<U+0096>"
Hurricane Fluttershy,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,"Fluttershy, what happened to you?"
Hurricane Fluttershy,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,"Oh, you poor thing. You know, there's only one cure for pony pox."
Hurricane Fluttershy,Cindy Morrow,fluttershy,"I know, plenty of bed<U+0096>"
Hurricane Fluttershy,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,Cold water! Those pony pox are clearing right up.
Hurricane Fluttershy,Cindy Morrow,fluttershy,"Oh, y'know, all of a sudden, I'm, I'm starting to feel better. [laughs nervously] I'll just get out of these robes and<U+0096> ow! Oh, my wing, oh, ow, it's hurt. I guess I can't fly after all<U+0096>"
Hurricane Fluttershy,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,"Messed up wing, huh? Stop horsing around, Fluttershy. We've got a lot of training to do. Come on now, what's going on?"
Hurricane Fluttershy,Cindy Morrow,fluttershy,"Well, y'see, uh, well... Oh, Rainbow Dash, I just can't do it! I can't fly!"
Hurricane Fluttershy,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,What are you talking about? Just last week you went into that wicked nose dive to save that falling baby bird right before it hit the ground!
Hurricane Fluttershy,Cindy Morrow,fluttershy,"But that was different, that was an emergency! This whole tornado thing, it's more like a performance, and you know how I hate performing in front of others. Don't you remember flight camp? I couldn't gallop hard or fly fast, not with everypony looking at me!"
Hurricane Fluttershy,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,It wasn't that bad.
Hurricane Fluttershy,Cindy Morrow,fluttershy,"You're right, Rainbow Dash, it wasn't bad. It was horrible!"
Hurricane Fluttershy,Cindy Morrow,fluttershy,"[voiceover] The other foals used to tease me, a lot!"
Hurricane Fluttershy,Cindy Morrow,fluttershy,I just can't risk that sort of humiliation again.
Hurricane Fluttershy,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,"Suck it up, Fluttershy! This is no time for<U+0096> I mean, confidence or no confidence, I'm gonna need every Pegasus to break the record, including you. I need every ounce of wing power I can get."
Hurricane Fluttershy,Cindy Morrow,fluttershy,"Oh, I-I don't think so, Rainbow Dash..."
Hurricane Fluttershy,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,[sighs] Thanks anyway.
Hurricane Fluttershy,Cindy Morrow,fluttershy,Wait. I'll do it.
Hurricane Fluttershy,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,You will?
Hurricane Fluttershy,Cindy Morrow,fluttershy,I will.
Hurricane Fluttershy,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,You're game?
Hurricane Fluttershy,Cindy Morrow,fluttershy,I'm game.
Hurricane Fluttershy,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,Alright!
Hurricane Fluttershy,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,"This is an anemometer. It measures your accelerative velocity and translates it into wing power, thus gauging your cumulative H2O anti-gravitational potential. Any other questions?"
Hurricane Fluttershy,Cindy Morrow,spike,It tells you how fast you're flying and how strong your wings are.
Hurricane Fluttershy,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,"Is that you again, Thunderlane? Please, we need to have a germ-free environment."
Hurricane Fluttershy,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,"Don't worry, Twilight. Thunderlane's just cooking up an excuse to spend tornado day in bed. Why don't you get over here and be our first test flyer, Thunderlane?"
Hurricane Fluttershy,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,We have 9.3 wing power.
Hurricane Fluttershy,Cindy Morrow,bulk biceps,YEAH!
Hurricane Fluttershy,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,16.5 wing power!
Hurricane Fluttershy,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,"Now listen up! If each of you can get your numbers up to at least 10.0 wing power by the end of the week, we'll no doubt set a new tornado speed record. We'll be number one!"
Hurricane Fluttershy,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,[hushed] Tell her!
Hurricane Fluttershy,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,"[hushed] No, you tell her!"
Hurricane Fluttershy,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,"[hushed] No, you!"
Hurricane Fluttershy,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,"Um... great job, Fluttershy! You measured, uh, uh, .5."
Hurricane Fluttershy,Cindy Morrow,spike,.5? Isn't that like... less than one?
Hurricane Fluttershy,Cindy Morrow,spike,Ow!
Hurricane Fluttershy,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,"Fluttershy, wait! So some punks poked a little fun at you and you got stage fright, big deal. You aren't gonna go quit just because of that, are you?"
Hurricane Fluttershy,Cindy Morrow,fluttershy,[crying] Yes!
Hurricane Fluttershy,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,But I need you!
Hurricane Fluttershy,Cindy Morrow,fluttershy,"I'm sorry, Rainbow Dash, I just [between sobs] don't have the courage right now..."
Hurricane Fluttershy,Cindy Morrow,fluttershy,"[sniffles] Oh, thank you, but I'm afraid a couple of little acorns won't solve my big flying problem."
Hurricane Fluttershy,Cindy Morrow,fluttershy,"I tried, but you should've seen those ponies laughing at me..."
Hurricane Fluttershy,Cindy Morrow,fluttershy,I know it's important to have confidence in myself...
Hurricane Fluttershy,Cindy Morrow,fluttershy,"Yes, yes, I do remember. The river was swelling..."
Hurricane Fluttershy,Cindy Morrow,fluttershy,...and you were scared...
Hurricane Fluttershy,Cindy Morrow,fluttershy,"...yes, I did tell you to never give up... and to believe in yourself. You're right, my friends. I shouldn't give up. I will get my confidence up and show everypony that I am a good flyer! A great flyer!"
Hurricane Fluttershy,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,"That's wonderful, Flitter. Much better than yesterday."
Hurricane Fluttershy,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,This is crazy awesome! We're gonna smash that record!
Hurricane Fluttershy,Cindy Morrow,spike,What did he say?
Hurricane Fluttershy,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,Do I look like I speak squirrel?
Hurricane Fluttershy,Cindy Morrow,spike,What's that?
Hurricane Fluttershy,Cindy Morrow,fluttershy,2.3? 2.3?! That has to be some kind of mistake! I worked so hard!
Hurricane Fluttershy,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,"Fluttershy, that's a huge improvement!"
Hurricane Fluttershy,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,"You did awesome, Fluttershy."
Hurricane Fluttershy,Cindy Morrow,fluttershy,"No, I didn't. I thought I'd gotten over my nerves, but they still got the best of me! There's no way I'll fly with 10.0 wing power tomorrow!"
Hurricane Fluttershy,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,So you won't fly with 10.0 wing power. Every bit counts!
Hurricane Fluttershy,Cindy Morrow,fluttershy,How would you feel if everypony else was flying with 10.0 wing power and you were flying with 2.5?
Hurricane Fluttershy,Cindy Morrow,spike,"Actually, it was only 2.3, and<U+0096> ow!"
Hurricane Fluttershy,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,"Well, uh... I'd feel... um..."
Hurricane Fluttershy,Cindy Morrow,fluttershy,"Exactly! Humiliated! [between sobs] I'm sorry, Rainbow Dash, I just can't do it!"
Hurricane Fluttershy,Cindy Morrow,spike,"It's okay, Rainbow Dash, you've still got plenty of wing power for your tornado. You'll be able to lift tons of water up to Cloudsdale!"
Hurricane Fluttershy,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,[sighs] If only there was a way to lift Fluttershy out of the dumps.
Hurricane Fluttershy,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,Are we ready to do this?
Hurricane Fluttershy,Cindy Morrow,spike,Look!
Hurricane Fluttershy,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,"Lazy Thunderlane! Where is he?! He's been trying to get out of tornado duty the whole time with his fake coughing and all. Rumble, where's your lazy brother?"
Hurricane Fluttershy,Cindy Morrow,rumble,He's got the feather flu. He's down at Ponyville Hospital.
Hurricane Fluttershy,Cindy Morrow,spike,But he's not the only one.
Hurricane Fluttershy,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,"Let's see, with those eight sick Pegasi out with the feather flu... [gasp] Oh no!"
Hurricane Fluttershy,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,Don't tell me we won't be able to break the windspeed record?
Hurricane Fluttershy,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,No...
Hurricane Fluttershy,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,Phew!
Hurricane Fluttershy,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,...You might not have enough wing power to create a tornado powerful enough to lift the water to Cloudsdale!
Hurricane Fluttershy,Cindy Morrow,spike,"Well, should we pack up?"
Hurricane Fluttershy,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,"No. Of course not. Forget the record. Cloudsdale still needs water! Okay, everypony! Let's give it all we've got! On the sound of the horn, we take off!"
Hurricane Fluttershy,Cindy Morrow,spike,You think they're gonna make it to eight hundred wing power?
Hurricane Fluttershy,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,I sure hope so! One hundred and fifty wing power. Two hundred and fifty wing power. Five hundred wing power!
Hurricane Fluttershy,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,Seven hundred and fifty wing power!
Hurricane Fluttershy,Cindy Morrow,fluttershy,Twilight!
Hurricane Fluttershy,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,Fluttershy! What are you doing here?!
Hurricane Fluttershy,Cindy Morrow,fluttershy,I figured... if I couldn't help Rainbow Dash with the tornado... the least I could do was offer moral support!
Hurricane Fluttershy,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,"She could sure use it, considering eight Pegasi are sick with the feather flu!"
Hurricane Fluttershy,Cindy Morrow,fluttershy,Oh no! That's terrible news!
Hurricane Fluttershy,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,Yaa<U+0096> oof!
Hurricane Fluttershy,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,Are you okay?
Hurricane Fluttershy,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,[muffled] I'm fine!
Hurricane Fluttershy,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,"Oh, you were so close to the eight hundred wing power minimum! I'm sorry, Rainbow Dash."
Hurricane Fluttershy,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,Rbbbb<U+0096> We've got to try again!
Hurricane Fluttershy,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,But you've pushed your crew to their limit already!
Hurricane Fluttershy,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,"If you break apart again, somepony could get hurt! You should quit, it's not safe!"
Hurricane Fluttershy,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,"No! One more time! I've gotta know we gave it our all! If I'm going down, I'm going down flying! C'mon, ponies, let's make this happen!"
Hurricane Fluttershy,Cindy Morrow,bulk biceps,YEAH!
Hurricane Fluttershy,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,"Okay, here we go... One hundred wing power! Two hundred! Five hundred!"
Hurricane Fluttershy,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,Stay in position! Flap those wings! Faster!
Hurricane Fluttershy,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,Seven hundred! Seven hundred and fifty wing power!
Hurricane Fluttershy,Cindy Morrow,spike,[yelps] They fell apart right after this!
Hurricane Fluttershy,Cindy Morrow,fluttershy,"Oh, I'm too nervous to look!"
Hurricane Fluttershy,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,C'mon! Just a little harder! I can see the water trying to funnel through!
Hurricane Fluttershy,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,"Seven ninety five! We are so close! Fluttershy, they need you up there!"
Hurricane Fluttershy,Cindy Morrow,fluttershy,I won't make a difference!
Hurricane Fluttershy,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,You can make a difference!
Hurricane Fluttershy,Cindy Morrow,fluttershy,My measly 2.3 wing power is still too little!
Hurricane Fluttershy,Cindy Morrow,spike,It's sticking at seven ninety five! I don't know if they've got any more in 'em!
Hurricane Fluttershy,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,Do it for Equestria! Do it for Rainbow Dash! Do it for yourself!
Hurricane Fluttershy,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,It's moving! She's doing it! Seven ninety eight! She surpassed her best wing power number!
Hurricane Fluttershy,Cindy Morrow,fluttershy,No!
Hurricane Fluttershy,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,She did it! She did it! They all did it!
Hurricane Fluttershy,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,"Whoa, girl, take it easy!"
Hurricane Fluttershy,Cindy Morrow,fluttershy,"Whuh, what? Did we do it?"
Hurricane Fluttershy,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,"Yeah, we did it! You did it!"
Hurricane Fluttershy,Cindy Morrow,spitfire,"Nice job, Rainbow Dash. You may not have set a new record, but you showed a lot of guts."
Hurricane Fluttershy,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,"Thanks, but if you wanna talk guts, then you've gotta give it to my number one flyer, Fluttershy! Let's hear it for Fluttershy!"
Hurricane Fluttershy,Cindy Morrow,fluttershy,"Dear Princess Celestia,"
Hurricane Fluttershy,Cindy Morrow,fluttershy,"Sometimes you can feel like what you have to offer is too little to make a difference, but today, I learned that everypony's contribution is important, no matter how small. If you just keep your head high, do your best, and believe in yourself, anything can happen."
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,sweetie belle,Can you believe Featherweight got his cutie mark? Featherweight! Before us!
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,snips,"Great cutie mark, Featherweight!"
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,snails,[chuckles] Looking good!
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,sweetie belle,I give up...
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,apple bloom,I've got it! The answer to all our problems!
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,sweetie belle,The Foal Free Press? How's the school paper gonna get us our cutie marks?
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,granny smith,Move your caboose!
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,apple bloom,Uh-oh. That's Granny Smith. Gotta run!
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,scootaloo,Maybe there's something to this newspaper idea.
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,sweetie belle,Guess it's worth a shot...
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,sweetie belle,Apple Bloom. Your newspaper idea was nothing but a big bust.
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,scootaloo,"We tried everything, from papier-m<e2>ch<e9> to making birds' nests, and nothing worked."
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,sweetie belle,What's so funny?
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,apple bloom,"What I meant was, we should write for the paper! We can get our cutie marks as journalists!"
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,cheerilee,"Okay, class, see you tomorrow! Oh, for those of you who want to join the newspaper staff, stay here, because we're meeting right now!"
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,apple bloom,Cutie marks in journalism!
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,scootaloo,Such a good idea.
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,cheerilee,"Welcome, everypony. Now, as you know, our editor-in-chief graduated last year<U+0096>"
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,sweetie belle,"Oh, oh, oh, ohohohoh!"
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,cheerilee,Yes?
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,sweetie belle,What's an editor-in-chief?
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,cheerilee,"Good question, Sweetie Belle. I like those reporter's instincts. The Foal Free Press is a student-run paper. I'm only involved as an adviser, so the editor-in-chief is the pony in charge, from choosing the stories to making sure it gets to press on time. Now, as I said, we have a new editor this year!"
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,diamond tiara,Hm.
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,cheerilee,I'll leave you alone now to discuss everypony's assignments. Have fun!
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,diamond tiara,"Alright, listen up. The Foal Free Press is a joke."
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,diamond tiara,"Nopony at this school takes it seriously. Well I, the editor-in-chief in charge, am going to deliver us to newfound glory!"
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,diamond tiara,First things first. Where's the staff photographer? Get out there and document everything. I'll decide what's important.
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,diamond tiara,"The rest of you, I want hard-hitting news and interesting think pieces. No more Namby-Pamby stories like last year's editor."
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,diamond tiara,"Well, there's a new regime now, and I want juicy stories. The juicier, the better! Now get out there and report!"
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,scootaloo,"Let's get out of here, girls. Maybe we can try packing boxes again."
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,sweetie belle,"But this could be our last chance to earn our cutie marks! If we really are supposed to be journalists, isn't it worth a little grief?"
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,scootaloo,I guess you're right. We can take a little bit of Diamond Tiara for a lifetime of cutie marks.
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,sweetie belle,C'mon! Let's go get these marks!
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,sweetie belle,[voiceover] My first story's going to be an exclusive interview.
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,scootaloo,[voiceover] I saw a brand new nest of baby birds the other day. I bet our readers would eat up a sweet story like that!
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,apple bloom,[voiceover] Granny Smith has all sorts of great stories! I reckon I'll do a piece on the history of Ponyville.
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,diamond tiara,"I hope you've got something, because everything so far is unusable. ""Baby Birds Born""? ""Rarity's Hot New Hat""? ""Ponyville: The Early Years""!? Oh! I don't know what you call this, but it sure isn't news!"
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,sweetie belle,We just... thought...
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,diamond tiara,"Get something else on my desk by the end of the day, and it better be juicy!"
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,scootaloo,Now what? Do you know what I had to do to get that story?
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,apple bloom,"Oh, you don't even wanna know what I had to sit through."
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,snips,"Oh! Get it off me, Snails!"
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,snails,"Eh, you get it off me, Snips?"
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,snips,"Aah! Stop it! You are making it worse! Nah! Oh, great."
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,snips,Aah!
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,snails,Get it off! Get it off!
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,sweetie belle,"[giggles] Hey, Featherweight, c'mere! [giggles] Take a few pictures of this, then meet me during lunch. Girls, I have our story."
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,snips,Our mothers always told us we'd end up in the papers someday.
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,diamond tiara,"Your column is a sensation! I don't want you doing news anymore. I want more columns like this. Columns about ponies and their private lives, the things they do when they think they're alone. You three are my new gossip columnists! And I love the way you signed it! ""Gabby Gums""... [sigh] That was a stroke of genius!"
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,sweetie belle,"We couldn't fit all of our names, so we decided to create one for all three of us."
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,diamond tiara,"Well, I want more Gabby Gums! Nice work, girls."
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,scootaloo,But we sure seem to have a gift for gossip.
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,sweetie belle,"If we can write a few more of these Gabby Gums columns, we'll earn our cutie marks for sure!"
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,cutie mark crusaders,Woo-hoo!
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,sweetie belle,Scootaloo? Do you have anything?
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,scootaloo,Nope.
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,sweetie belle,Apple Bloom?
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,apple bloom,[sighs] Sorry.
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,scootaloo,"Let's face it, nothing very juicy happens at this school."
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,sweetie belle,We're doomed.
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,rarity,"Ohh, Sweetie Belle... Was she raised in a barn or something? [gasps] Oh, you really shouldn't be snooping, Rarity... Oh, but it's so much fun, Rarity. Hello... what's this? [giggles] Gum on their bum! [laughs] Too rich!"
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,sweetie belle,Can you please keep it down with all the laughter? I'm trying to<U+0096> hey!
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,rarity,"Bleh! I, I was just<U+0096>"
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,sweetie belle,Are you snooping through my saddlebag?
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,sweetie belle,How dare you!
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,rarity,"Oh, but this Gabby Gums column is so funny!"
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,sweetie belle,You actually like the school paper?
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,rarity,It's so much juicier than anything in the boring old Ponyville Express. Could I borrow this to show my friends?
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,sweetie belle,Your friends would wanna read the Foal Free Press?
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,rarity,"Oh, they'd just love Gabby Gums! Who is she, anyway? I've never heard of her before. Is she a new<U+0096>"
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,sweetie belle,"We gave up too quickly, girls. Forget trying to squeeze stories out of this school. We need to expand!"
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,apple bloom,We can find all kinds of great gossip out there in Ponyville!
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,sweetie belle,We'll need to tell Featherweight to start working overtime.
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,scootaloo,"Sweetie Belle, you're a genius!"
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,diamond tiara,"""Pound and Pumpkin Cake Trip to the Store Ends in Tears."" Gabby Gums comes through again!"
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,diamond tiara,"Send 'em twenty copies, and if they run out of those, we'll send 'em twenty more! You three are doing a great job for this paper. Keep those columns coming!"
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,scootaloo,This is great!
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,rarity,"Oh, this is the life, isn't it, girls? The best hooficure I've ever had!"
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,applejack,"[voice vibrating] You said it, ooh..."
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,spike,[sighs] I don't know if I've ever been so relaxed.
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,You guys!
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,spike,Aaah!
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,"The new Gabby Gums just came out! ""The Great and Powerful Trixie's Secrets Revealed!"""
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,rarity,"We already read that one, Rainbow Dash. Come on, relax, have a hooficure, it feels amazing."
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,"[swallows] Did you forget who you're talking to? The day I get a hooficure is the day I turn in my daredevil license. Besides, I haven't read this Gabby Gums yet."
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,spike,"Well, do it quietly, will ya? [sigh] Some of us are trying to unwind!"
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"I like Gabby Gums too, but don't you think she can be a little mean?"
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,applejack,"She's not mean, Twilight, she's a hoot!"
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"""Celestia Just Like Us""? Gabby Gums doesn't value anypony's privacy."
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,rarity,"Oh, lighten up, Twilight, it's nothing but harmless gossip!"
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,"Yeah, Twilight, I mean listen to this one. ""Mayor Not Naturally Gray!"" The Mayor in a mane dyeing scandal? Who wouldn't wanna read that?"
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,I just can't help feeling sorry for the ponies featured in her columns. It's gotta be a little embarrassing.
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,Are you kidding? Do you know how awesome it is to get your name in the paper?
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,rarity,"Rainbow, why don't you join me in one of these delicious hooficures?"
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,"It's that good, huh? Well, maybe just one little hoof."
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,"[yelps] Forget it, I don't like ponies touching my hooves. Man... I'd love it if Gabby Gums did a story on me."
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,spike,She did one on me.
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,spike,Aaaah!
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,apple bloom,"""Exclusive! Local Dragon Tells All! Spike opens up about Canterlot, naps, and his favorite jams!"""
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,scootaloo,It's our best column yet!
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,diamond tiara,More like your worst column yet! Gabby Gums didn't become the biggest thing in Ponyville with namby-pamby stories like this!
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,apple bloom,"[sighs] Yeah, she's right. This column is a little softer than our usual gossip."
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,sweetie belle,Were you guys feeling guilty about all the gossip too? Like... maybe we could be hurting other ponies' feelings?
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,apple bloom,"Yeah, I didn't wanna say anything because everypony loves Gabby Gums so much, but... I was sorta hoping we could start writing more stories like this one."
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,scootaloo,Me too.
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,sweetie belle,"If we're gonna get our cutie marks, we've got to give the ponies what they want."
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,cutie mark crusaders,Awww...
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,applejack,"""Applejack Asleep on the Job!"" Can y'all believe this?! And this one: ""Big McIntosh <U+0096> What's He Hiding?"" Who the hay does this Gabby Gums think she is?!"
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Listen to this one. ""Twilight Sparkle: I Was a Canterlot Snob. A well-placed scaly source close to the prissy pony says Twilight Sparkle thinks Ponyville is nothing but muddy roads and low-class rubes."" Spike!"
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,How could you say such a thing?
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,spike,"Well, I didn't! Gabby Gums made that up! I never said anything like that!"
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,rarity,"Everypony, please! She's just a harmless schoolpony engaged in a little harmless gossip. You're really making too big a deal out of this."
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"But it's all lies! Gabby Gums prints whatever she wants! She doesn't care whose reputation she destroys! ""Fluttershy Has Tail Extensions!"" ""Pinkie Pie is an Out-of-Control Party Animal!"""
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Oh, look! According to this one, the Cakes are breaking up!"
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,mrs. cake,Mrs. We are?!
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,"[muffled] Well, my life is officially over. [normal] Gabby Gums has made it to Cloudsdale."
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"""Rainbow Dash: Speed Demon or Super Softie?""?!"
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,"I grabbed as many copies as I could, but it was too late! [crying] I'm a laughing stock!"
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"See, Rarity? Your so-called 'harmless gossip' can be very hurtful!"
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,rarity,"Honestly, you ponies have no sense of humor. So she tweaks a few ponies every now and then, maybe they deser<U+0096> [gasps] I'll destroy her! ""The Drama-Queen Diaries""... She's reprinted my diary! How could Gabby Gums possibly get access to my private diary?!"
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,We've got to put a stop to this once and for all! Sweetie Belle's on the newspaper staff. Maybe she knows who Gabby Gums is.
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,rarity,"[gasps] My sister would never associate with anyone as beastly as Gabby Gums! I resent you even suggesting such a thing, Twilight! Why, she's the most innocent, most lovely<U+0096>"
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,rarity,<U+0096>most evil pony in Equestria! How could my own sister steal my private diary? How could my own sister be... Gabby Gums?
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,rarity,"Et tu, Gabby Gums?!"
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,sweetie belle,[gasps] You know?! How'd you find out?!
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,rarity,The gilded pages of your betrayal!
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,sweetie belle,"Oh, yeah."
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,rarity,"How could you do this to me?! You stole my secret diary and published it for all the world to read! Gossip can be a very hurtful thing. It is an invasion of privacy, just like when I snooped through your saddlebag. You didn't like that much, did you?"
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,sweetie belle,No...
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,rarity,What is important is that you understand how your column makes the ponies that you're writing about feel!
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,sweetie belle,"I do understand, and we've all been feeling guilty, but we just want our cutie marks so badly!"
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,rarity,Do you really think that writing nasty things and making everypony feel horrible is your destiny?
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,sweetie belle,"Well, when you put it that way..."
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,diamond tiara,No! I won't let you quit!
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,sweetie belle,But the gossip we've been printing is hurting everypony's feelings!
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,diamond tiara,"Feelings?! I don't care about feelings! Gabby Gums is my bread and butter, and I'm not gonna let you goody-two-horseshoes take that away from me!"
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,sweetie belle,"We're sorry, Diamond Tiara, but we've made our decision."
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,scootaloo,"Yeah, you can't force us to keep gossiping."
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,diamond tiara,When you see these... you may not want to quit after all.
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,diamond tiara,I told Featherweight to document everything...
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,diamond tiara,...And that's exactly what he did.
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,scootaloo,[gasps] Gimme those!
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,diamond tiara,"Sorry, girls, property of the Foal Free Press. And if Gabby Gums really does go into retirement, I'll need something to fill that empty column space. Now get out there and bring me more Gabby Gums!"
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,sweetie belle,"We'll find a way out of this, girls."
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,scootaloo,Maybe Rainbow Dash will have a story for us. She's always good for some gossip.
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,apple bloom,"Rainbow Dash! Hey, Rainbow Dash!"
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,"Well, if it isn't Gabby Gums!"
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,sweetie belle,"You heard too, huh?"
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,Are you kidding? Everypony in town knows it's you three.
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,scootaloo,"Don't suppose you'd let us write a column on you, huh?"
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,sweetie belle,"Oh, hi, Angel. Is Fluttershy home?"
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,scootaloo,"[muffled] Hey, what gives?"
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,spike,"A-ha! [muffled] Twilight thought you might try to show your faces around here, so she put up a force field."
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,apple bloom,"Aw, c'mon, Applejack! You're not mad at us too, are you?"
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,applejack,Eeyup.
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,apple bloom,You're not even gonna talk to us?
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,applejack,Nnope.
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,big mcintosh,"You should be ashamed of yourself, humiliatin' your sister 'n' me like that. We don't wanna talk to any o' y'all right now so take your little gossip column and your embarrassing photographs and just go away!"
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,sweetie belle,We've ruined all of our friendships and we still don't have our cutie marks!
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,apple bloom,This is the worst day ever!
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,scootaloo,"Oh yeah? Wait 'til tomorrow, our most embarrassing moments are about to be published for everypony to laugh at."
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,apple bloom,So what do we do?
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,sweetie belle,"I don't know, but we're not leaving this clubhouse until we think of something!"
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,diamond tiara,"That's it, Gabby Gums is out of time. Run these instead. I want this paper on every street corner in Ponyville!"
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,sweetie belle,Stop the presses!
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,scootaloo,We have a Gabby Gums column!
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,diamond tiara,"Hmph, you're lucky I'm nice."
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,diamond tiara,"This better not happen again, or else."
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,diamond tiara,"[sighs] Well done, Diamond Tiara. You've averted yet another crisis with your amazing diplomatic skills. [gasps] ""An Open Letter to Ponyville by Gabby Gums""?! What is this?! Ooh, they're not gonna get away with this! I'll publish those photos tomorrow! They messed with the wrong pony!"
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,sweetie belle,"To the citizens of Ponyville,"
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,apple bloom,"Y'see, I'm actually three little fillies, Sweetie Belle, Apple Bloom, and Scootaloo."
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,scootaloo,"As the popularity of our column grew, we got swept up in the hype. We knew that what we were doing didn't feel quite right, but we ignored the guilt because everypony seemed to want to read what we were writing."
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,sweetie belle,"From now on, we promise to respect everypony else's privacy, and we won't engage in hurtful gossip any more."
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,apple bloom,"All we can do is ask for your forgiveness, Ponyville."
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,cheerilee,And for the next editor of the Foal Free Press...
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,cheerilee,"...here's your new editor-in-chief, Featherweight!"
Ponyville Confidential,M. A. Larson,diamond tiara,Ugh! Him? But what about me?!
MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"Marzipan Mascarpone Meringue Madness. You've really outdone yourselves, Mr. and Mrs. Cake. This is sure to be the winning entry of this year's national dessert competition!"
MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,mrs. cake,"Mrs. Oh, thank you, Pinkie!"
MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,mr. cake,Mr. And thanks for transporting it all the way to Canterlot for us.
MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,Absolutely! It's my honor and I<U+0096>
MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"Uh, beg pardon, but could we maybe move things along? This here cake's a mite heavy. Right, Big McIntosh?"
MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,big mcintosh,[grunts] Eeyup...!
MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"Alrighty then, Big Mac! To the train depot! That's it, Big Mac, nice and slow. This is precious cargo you're carrying."
MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,mr. cake,"Mr. Yes, it took months of planning and testing."
MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,mrs. cake,Mrs. I would hate for it to<U+0096>
MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"Don't worry, Mr. and Mrs. Cake. Rainbow Dash, Fluttershy, a little pegassistance? I'll get it there safely, you'll see!"
MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,mrs. cake,"Mrs. Ahahah, oh... of course, Pinkie."
MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,mr. cake,Mr. We never doubted you.
MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"Twilight, can I see you a second? A nice protective spell as extra insurance. [laughs] Better safe than sorry. AJ, Rarity, one last thing? All right, everypony, we're in the home stretch here."
MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"See, Mr. and Mrs. Cake? I got it here without a hitch! Now all we have to do is get it... in?"
MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,[sigh] Thank you all for helping me get the cake safely on the dessert car.
MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,Thank you for inviting us all to go with you to Canterlot for the National Dessert Competition.
MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,I'm sure the festivities will be just lovely.
MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,Phooey on the festivities! I can't wait to try all those tasty treats!
MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"Well, the tastiest treat of all is sure to be the Cakes' Marzipan Mascarpone Meringue Madness. All that rich creamy goodness of the marzipan, combined with the tart tanginess of the mascarpone, blended perfectly with the smooth, silky sweetness of the meringue. That's why I call the Marzipan Mascarpone Meringue Madness the ""MMMM""."
MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"Exactly. It's the most delicious delectable delightful de-lovely cake in Equestria, and it's sure to win first prize."
MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,Donut Joe! What are you doing in Ponyville?
MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,Hello. What's your name?
MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,The Cakes' Marzipan Mascarpone Meringue Madness is going to win!
MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"Well, it sure looks like we're in for a delicious competition tomorrow. Maybe we should all settle in for a good night's sleep."
MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,[yawns] I gotta admit I'm pretty beat.
MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"Yeah, I'm gonna hit the hay myself."
MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"Wait! Didn't you hear those chefs? We have to protect ""MMMM""."
MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,MMMM?
MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"Mmm-hmmm. I know for super sure that ""MMMM"" is the best dessert in all of Equestria, and I know that they know it too."
MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,So...
MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,So... one of them is going to sabotage the Cakes' cake tonight! You have to help me stand guard!
MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,Pinkie... you're overreacting.
MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"Yeah, those chefs aren't going to do your cake any harm."
MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,But they are! I just know it.
MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,"Fine! If you want to stand guard, go for it. We're going to bed."
MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,I'll show them. I'll stay up all night and protect you. Nothing and nopony will stop me from keeping you safe.
MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"Huh? Stop, you saboteur! I have you now! Wha? A-ha! Ahh?! Oh! Thank Celestia you're okay! But one of those bakers is mixing up something bad, so I'm not leaving you again no matter what."
MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"Huh? Who turned out the moon? Don't go near that cake, thief!"
MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"Stop, thief!"
MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"[snores] Huh? What? [gasp] The cake! Oh, MMMM, you look mmmm-marvelous."
MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,Whoa!
MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,I know. I think some congratulations are in order for a job well done.
MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"Um, you better hold off on giving yourself an award just yet, Pinkie. Look."
MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,What is it?
MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,What happened?
MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"It's the Marzipan Mascarpone Meringue Madness, it's been [crying] mutilated!"
MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,Now we just need to find out who done it.
MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"You mean, who did it."
MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,Exactly. Who did-done-dood it.
MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"Well, having read many mystery novels, I know that the only way to discover the culprit is to investigate."
MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,Exactly.
MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"And as chief detective, that's exactly what I'm gonna do."
MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"Uh, you're investigatin'?"
MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,Yes! And Twilight shall be my lowly assistant who asks silly questions with obvious answers.
MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"Fine, Pinkie. Should we start looking for clues?"
MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"Perfect silly question, my dear Twilight. Because the obvious answer is..."
MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,Yes?
MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,No! 'Cause I know who did it.
MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"Pinkie, how could you possibly know?"
MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"How could I possibly not know? Clearly this dastardly deed was done by the baker, who knew their dessert could not measure up to the mastery of the Marzipan Mascarpone Meringue Madness. I guess you feared your <e9>clairs lacked flair, Gustave!"
MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"Thus, destroying the cake and the Cakes' chance of winning the National Dessert Competition."
MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,But it makes no sense!
MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"What do you mean, lowly assistant?"
MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"Well, first, if you were tied to the train tracks, how are you now here?"
MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,Huh... Guess that isn't a totally silly question.
MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"And second, the cake hasn't been sliced. It's been bitten. Just look at the teeth marks!"
MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"Hm... You're right, my fine fellow. Gustave le Grand is clearly in the clear, which means the ""MMMM"" was destroyed by another baker. A baker who's donuts are do-nots. That's right, it was Joe!"
MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"[voiceover] Or as he's known the spy world, Mane. Con Mane."
MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,Crushing the Cakes' chances to win!
MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"Pinkie! There is no laser beam security system! And Joe is not sleek, stealthy Con Mane! He's big, gruff, and messy!"
MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,"Although, you would look rather dapper in a tuxedo."
MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"Huh... You may be right, lowly assistant."
MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,May be?
MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"Now that I'm taking a closer look at these desserts, I see that one simply cannot look me in the eye."
MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,Pinkie... that moose is a mousse!
MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"Yes, and the mule behind the moose panicked when she saw the mastery of the ""MMMM""."
MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,So you're saying that the culprit is...
MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,Mulia Mild!
MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"Putting an end to the Cakes' dreams of taking first prize. Huh, I hope you're proud of yourself, Mulia."
MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"Pinkie, stop! This is ridiculous! Look at her!"
MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,[sigh] I guess you're right...
MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,Thank you!
MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"But I was so sure that it was one of the other bitter bakers that destroyed the ""MMMM"". That way, their delicious dessert would reign supreme. I mean, just look at Joe's Donutopia. It's a spectacular city of donutty delight, topped temptingly in sprinklicious sprinkles. And Gustave's <e9>clairs look incredibly edible, with glistening glaziness. But then there's Mulia Mild's Mousse Moose. [sighs] why, this mouth-wateringly marvelous mousse moose tempts the taste buds with its silky, smooth, yummy-nummy, chocolateyness. So why did this criminal devour the Marzipan Mascarpone Meringue Madness while leaving this trio of tasty treats untouched?"
MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,[gasp] Now I have no idea who do-doned it!
MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,This mystery gets more mysterious every minute.
MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"Well, you have to stop the wild accusations and get to the truth. Everypony go back to your cars while we do a little investigating. Okay, Pinkie, in order to really solve this mystery, we're going to have to find clues. Now you were here at the scene of the crime all night."
MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"Huh! You're not accusing me, are you?"
MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,No! But maybe you saw something that will help us.
MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,I saw a silhouette in the moonlight!
MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,Good... Let's retrace your steps.
MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"And then I chased the culprit down the train towards the caboose, but when I got there, he was gone."
MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"Hm... A-ha! Our first clue. I think I know who did it, Pinkie."
MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,Already?
MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"Yes, but I need more evidence to confirm. Tell me what happened next."
MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"I heard somepony else in the dessert car and chased them up to the engine. But when I got there, all I saw was the conductor shoveling coal."
MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"The conductor, huh? [gasp] But that doesn't make any sense. What happened next, Pinkie?"
MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,Well... I went back to the dessert car.
MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,Yes?
MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"The curtains mysteriously closed, all on their own."
MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,Interesting. Anything else?
MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"I heard hoofsteps, a loud thud..."
MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"...and then they were gone! When I opened the curtains, I saw that the portrait by the door was all crooked."
MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"Oh my, what is that?"
MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,What next Pinkie?
MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,That's it. I was here guarding the cake the rest of the night. I mean... I slept by the cake the rest of the night.
MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"And when you woke up, half the cake was gone?"
MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,Exactly.
MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"By Jove, I think I've got it. Call everypony back. We have a cake culprit to catch."
MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,I bet you're wondering why you're all here again.
MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,We have discovered the true culprit of this cake carnage.
MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"Well, you see, when committing a crime, it's crucial that one never leaves behind clues, especially an obvious clue like... this."
MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"A-ha! A blue feather! I knew it was you, Gustave le Grand!"
MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"Pinkie, Gustave doesn't have blue feathers."
MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"No, 'cause he's been dyeing them!"
MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"No, Pinkie. Remember how when you chased the suspect to the caboose, they suddenly disappeared? That's because they flew away. But the thief did leave a little something behind, didn't you, Rainbow Dash?"
MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,I-I don't even like cake!
MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,So Rainbow Dash did it! Case solved!
MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"Case not solved, because when we went to the engine, I saw the conductor's hat. And inside the hat was... this."
MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,So it was you! That pink hair came from your rainbow-colored mane!
MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,"I don't have pink in my mane, Pinkie!"
MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,So you're wearing a wig?
MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,Ow! Cut it out!
MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"Pinkie, remember? You chased a pony to the engine, where you thought you saw the conductor shoveling coal, but that wasn't the conductor at all. It was... Fluttershy!"
MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,fluttershy,[gasp] Oh my.
MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"You're goin' down, Fluttershy!"
MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"Pinkie! But then another clue confounded my suspicions. You were guarding the cake when the curtains mysteriously closed. But that's no mystery, that's magic. But when the thief tried to make their great escape, they left a little addition to the portrait. Has anypony else noticed that Rarity is wearing her hair rather differently today?"
MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,"[gasp] What? Is it a crime to change one's style now and again? Why, I think it's a crime not to."
MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,Really?
MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,"Fine, I'm guilty! [crying] I wear false eyelashes! Oh, and I took a bite of the cake."
MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,fluttershy,So did I.
MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,"Aw nuts, so did I."
MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,You just made it sound so delectable.
MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,fluttershy,So tasty.
MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,And boy was it!
MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,"I only meant to take a little, lady-like bite."
MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,fluttershy,And it was so good.
MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,"Yeah, I just dove right in!"
MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,fluttershy,But I'm really really sorry.
MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,Terribly sorry.
MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,"Sorry, Pinkie."
MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,That's okay. At least this mystery is finally solved.
MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"But it isn't. We figured out who ate the Marzipan Mascarpone Meringue Madness, but we still don't know who devoured the other bakers' goods."
MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"You're right, Twilight. You know what we have to do?"
MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"Well... Yes, I do. Do you?"
MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"Look for clues! [sniffing] Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh."
MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"Well, Pinkie. Did you find the devourer of the desserts?"
MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,I most certainly did. It was none other than... the bakers!
MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"First of all, Gustave has mousse in his moustache! And Joe has <e9>clair in his hair! And Mulia has sprinkles in her wrinkles!"
MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"What do you say, bakers?"
MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"Well, everypony, we finally have the mystery solved."
MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,I think we can fix that. Come on!
MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"Dear Princess Celestia,"
MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"Today I learned that it is not good to jump to conclusions. You have to find out all the facts before saying somepony did something. If you don't, you could end up blaming somepony for something they never did. This could hurt their feelings, and it can make you look really foolish. So from now on, I will always make sure to get all the facts."
MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"How's that for a lesson, Princess Celestia?"
MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,Care for a bite?
MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,I don't mind if I do.
MMMystery on the Friendship Express,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,Mmmmm.
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,Ahh!
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,It is gorgeous out. Just gorgeous!
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"Dear Twilight, I am sure you are as excited as I am about the upcoming wedding in Canterlot. [to the others] Wedding? [reading] I will be presiding over the ceremony, but would very much like you and your friends to help with the preparations for this wonderful occasion. Fluttershy, I would like you and your songbird choir to provide the music."
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,Oh my goodness! What an honor!
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"Pinkie Pie, I can think of no one more qualified than you to host the reception."
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,"Hip, hip, hooray!"
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"Applejack, you will be in charge of the catering for the reception."
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,applejack,"Well, color me pleased as punch!"
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Rainbow Dash<U+0096>
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"...I would very much appreciate it if you could perform a sonic rainboom as the bride and groom complete their ""I do""'s."
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,Yes!
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"Rarity, you will be responsible for designing the dresses for the bride and her bridesmaids."
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"Princess Celestia wants me to<U+0096> [unintelligible] ...wedding dress? For a Canterlot wedding... I, ah, ooh, oooh!"
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"And as for you, Twilight, you will be playing the most important role of all: Making sure that everything goes as planned. See you all very soon. Yours, Princess Celestia. But... I don't understand. Who's getting married?"
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,spike,"Oh, wait! Uh, I was probably supposed to give you this one first."
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Princess Celestia cordially invites you to the wedding of Princess Mi Amore Cadenza and... [gasp] My brother?!
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,applejack,"Your brother's getting married? Congratulations, Twilight! That's great news!"
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,"Um, Twilight? Are you okay?"
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"Sorry, it's just that Shining Armor and I have always been so close. He's my B.B.B.F.F!"
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Big Brother Best Friend Forever?
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"Before I came here and learned the importance of friendship, Shining Armor was the only pony I ever really accepted as a friend. When I was just a filly, I found it rather silly To see how many other ponies I could meet I had my books to read, didn't know that I would ever need Other ponies to make my life complete"
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"And though he's, oh, so far away I hoped that he would stay My big brother best friend Forever... Forever..."
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,applejack,As one of your P.F.F.'s...
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,applejack,Pony Friends Forever...
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,applejack,...I wanna tell you that I think your brother sounds like a real good guy.
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"He is pretty special. I mean, they don't let just anypony be captain of the Royal Guard."
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"[chirp] So let me get this straight. We're helping out with the wedding of not only a princess, but a captain of the Royal Guard?"
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,I guess we are.
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"Ooh, ooh, oooh!"
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,"A sonic rainboom? At a wedding?! Can you say ""best wedding ever""?!"
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,[gasp] [echoing] Best wedding ever!
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,spike,"So you all get to help with the big fancy wedding, but I'm the one who gets to host the bachelor party! I have just one question. What's a bachelor party?"
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,applejack,"Why the long face, sugarcube?"
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"I'm just thinking about Shining Armor. Ever since I moved to Ponyville, we've been seeing each other less and less. And now that he's starting a new family with this ""Princess Mi Amore Ca-whatshername"", we'll probably never see each other."
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,applejack,"Come on, now. You're his sister. He'll always make time for you."
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Couldn't seem to make time to tell me he was getting married.
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,"We're here, we're here!"
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,"Whoa, what's with all the guards?"
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,I'm sure they're just taking the necessary precautions. Royal weddings do bring out the strangest ponies.
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"Now, let's get going! We've got work to do!"
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,applejack,And you've got a big brother to go congratulate.
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Yeah. Congratulate. And then give him a piece of my mind.
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"I've got something to say to you, mister."
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,shining armor,"Twily! Ah, I've missed, you, kid. How was the train ride? I<U+0096>"
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"How dare you not tell me in person that you were getting married! I'm your sister, for pony's sake!"
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,shining armor,It's not my fault! Princess Celestia has requested a major increase in security. Didn't you see all the guards at the train station?
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"Yeah, there's a big wedding coming up. Maybe you heard about it?"
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,shining armor,"It has nothing to do with the wedding. A threat has been made against Canterlot. We don't know who's responsible for it, but Princess Celestia asked that I help provide additional protection. This, you need to see."
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,shining armor,[gasps] The burden of keeping Canterlot safe and secure rests squarely on my shoulders. Staying focused on the task at hand has been my top priority.
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"Okay, okay, I get it. You've got a really important job protecting all of Canterlot with a force field only you can conjure up. But still... how could you not tell me about something as big as your wedding? Am I not that important to you any more?"
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,shining armor,Hey. You're my little sister. Of course you're important to me. But I'd understand if you didn't want to be my best mare now.
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,You want me to be your best mare?
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,shining armor,Well... yeah.
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"I'd be honored! But I'm still pretty ticked you're marrying somepony I don't even know! When did you even meet this ""Princess Mi Amore Cadenza""?"
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,shining armor,"Twily, Princess Mi Amore Cadenza is Cadance, your old foalsitter."
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Cadance? As in the Cadance? As in the greatest foalsitter in all the history of foalsitters?!
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,shining armor,[chuckles] You tell me. She was your foalsitter.
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"Ohmygoshohmygosh! Cadance is only the most amazing pony ever! She's beautiful, she's caring, she's kind..."
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,How many unicorns can just spread love wherever they go? I only know of one! And you're marrying her! [sing-song voice] You're marrying Cadance! You're marrying Cadance!
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,princess cadance,I hope I'm not interrupting anything important.
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"Cadance! Sunshine, sunshine, ladybugs awake! Clap your hooves and do a little shake!"
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,princess cadance,What are you doing?
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"Cadance, it's me, Twilight!"
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,princess cadance,[uninterested] Uh-huh.
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,shining armor,"I've gotta get back to my station, but Cadance will be checking in with all of you to see how things are going. I think I speak for both of us when I say we couldn't be more excited to have you here. Right, dear?"
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,princess cadance,Absolutely.
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,shining armor,"Well, we'll let you get to it."
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,applejack,"Cake, check. Ice sculpture, check. Best darn bite-size apple fritter you ever tasted..."
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Mmm. Check.
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,applejack,"Hiya, Princess!"
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,princess cadance,"Please, call me Princess Mi Amore Cadenza."
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,applejack,"Hiya, Princess Mi Amore Cadenza. You come to check out what's on the menu for your big day?"
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,princess cadance,I have!
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,applejack,"Aw, shucks. Why don't you take a few to go? [squee] I know how you brides can be. So busy, you forget to get a little somethin' in your belly."
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Did... you see what she...
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"Oh, you should have seen how she acted back there. I don't know when she changed, but she changed! [imitating Cadance] ""Please, call me Princess Mi Amore Cadenza."""
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,princess cadance,Did I hear someone say my name?
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,princess cadance,[unenthusiastically] Uh-huh. Is my dress ready?
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"[stammers] Yes, of course. Um, I've been working on it ever since I was given the assignment, and I think you'll be pleased with the results! Mmm!"
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,princess cadance,I was hoping for something with more beading and a longer train.
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"Oh, yes, of course."
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,princess cadance,And those should be a different color.
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,princess cadance,Make them a different color.
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"Gee, maybe her name should be ""Princess Demandy-pants."""
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,"Okay, let me see. We've been over the games... [rattles dice] ...the dances..."
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,[gasps] I think this reception is gonna be perfect! Don't you?
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,princess cadance,Perfect! ...If we were celebrating a six-year-old's birthday party.
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,[gasps] Thank you!
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,princess luna,"Rest, my sister. As always, I will guard the night."
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Bet I can guess what you're all thinking. Cadance is the absolute worst bride-to-be ever.
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,spike,"[high voice] Who, me?"
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,applejack,Spike! That goes on the cake.
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"Twilight, whatever are you talking about? Cadance is an absolute gem!"
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"Rarity, she was so demanding!"
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"Well, of course she is! Why shouldn't she expect the very best on her wedding day?"
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"Applejack, did you know that after she told you how much she just 'love-love-loved' your hors d'eouvres, she threw them in the trash?"
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,applejack,"Aw, she was probably just trying to spare my feelin's."
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"No, she was just being fake and totally insincere!"
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,She did raise her voice at one of my birds during rehearsal.
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,See? Rude!
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,But he was singing really off-key.
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"Pinkie Pie, you had to have noticed how Cadance treated<U+0096>"
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"Never mind. Rainbow Dash, you're with me, right?"
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,"Sorry, Twi. Been too busy prepping for my sonic rainboom to pay much attention to the bride's bad attitude."
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,The princess is about to get married. I'm sure any negative behavior she might be displaying is simply the result of nerves.
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"And I'm sure it's the result of being an awful pony who doesn't deserve to even know Shining Armor, let alone marry him!"
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,applejack,Think maybe you're bein' just a tiny bit possessive of your brother?
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"I am not being possessive, and I am not taking it out on Cadance! You're all just too caught up in your wedding planning to notice that maybe there shouldn't even [thumps table] be a wedding!"
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,shining armor,"Twily! Your big brother's looking pretty good, don't you think? Huh. Everything okay?"
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,We need to talk. I think you're making a big<U+0096>
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,shining armor,"Oh, uh, hi, sweetie."
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,She sure has a way of sneaking up on people.
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,princess cadance,"Could I speak to you for a moment, dear?"
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,shining armor,Better see what she wants.
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,princess cadance,"[muffled] Look, we need to talk."
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,shining armor,[muffled] I'm here to talk.
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,princess cadance,"[muffled] It's about your sister, okay?"
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,shining armor,"[muffled] I<U+0096> look, look, she's okay<U+0096>"
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,princess cadance,"[muffled] Just... listen to me, (over Shining Armor) alright? No no<U+0096>"
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,shining armor,"[muffled] I'm listening, I'm listening."
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,princess cadance,[muffled] I thought I made it perfectly clear I didn't want you to wear that.
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,shining armor,This was my favorite uncle's.
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,princess cadance,And?
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,shining armor,And I think I should wear it.
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,princess cadance,Are you disagreeing with me?
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,shining armor,I guess I am<U+0096> Ah!
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,princess cadance,"Oh, dear. Are you getting another one of your headaches?"
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,shining armor,Gyah!
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,princess cadance,Feeling better?
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,shining armor,[grunts] Mm-hmm.
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,She isn't just unpleasant and rude. She's downright evil!
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,shining armor,Twilight!
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,princess cadance,Let her go.
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,shining armor,Huh. It seemed like she had something else she wanted to tell me.
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,princess luna,"Who goes there? Stay indoors, Twilight Sparkle."
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Shining Armor's in real trouble! You have to help<U+0096>
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Dresses? What are you<U+0096>?
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,Can you believe it? We're gonna be Princess Mi Amore Cadenza's new bridesmaids!
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,New bridesmaids? What happened to her old bridesmaids?
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,applejack,She didn't say. But she did tell us that she would love-love-love it if we'd fill in for them.
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,Seeing as we've been working so hard and everything.
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,applejack,And you had your doubts about her.
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,Told you she was an absolute gem!
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,You sure this is what I should wear? Doesn't seem all that aerodynamic.
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,Hmm. I'll see what I can do.
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Looks like I really am on my own.
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,princess celestia,"Perfect, girls. No need to rush. Then of course, Cadance will enter."
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,princess celestia,"I'll say a few words, and then we'll begin with the vows. Shining Armor, you'll get the ring from your best mare."
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,spike,[deep voice] Do you? [high voice] I do!
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,shining armor,Hey... has anypony seen Twilight?
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,I'm here! I'm not gonna stand next to her! And neither should you!
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,shining armor,"I'm sorry, I... I don't know why she's acting like this."
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,princess cadance,Maybe we should just ignore her.
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,You have to listen to me!
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,"Oh, goodness! Are you okay?"
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,I'm fine.
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,applejack,Ya sure about that?
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,I've got something to say! She's evil!
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"She's been horrible to my friends, she's obviously done something to her bridesmaids, and if that wasn't enough, I saw her put a spell on my brother that made his eyes go all [bells jangling]!"
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,princess cadance,[starts crying] Why are you doing this to me?!
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Because you're evil!
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"Evil! And if I don't stop you, you're gonna ruin my brother's life!"
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,shining armor,"You want to know why my eyes went all [bells jangling]? Nuh! Because ever since I started having to perform my protection spell, I've been getting terrible migraines. Cadance hasn't been casting spells on me. She's been using her magic to heal me!"
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,shining armor,"And she decided to replace her bridesmaids because she found out the only reason they wanted to be in the wedding was so that they could meet Canterlot royalty! And if she hasn't been on her best behavior with your [stomps hoof] friends, it's because with me being so busy, she's had to make all the decisions about the wedding!"
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,I was just trying to<U+0096>
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,shining armor,"She's been completely stressed out because it's really important to her that our big day be perfect! Something that obviously wasn't important to you! [gasps] Now if you'll excuse me, I have to go and comfort my bride. And you can forget about being my best mare. In fact, if I were you, I wouldn't show up to the wedding at all."
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,applejack,"C'mon, y'all. Let's go check on the princess."
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,I was<U+0096>
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,princess celestia,You have a lot to think about.
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Maybe I was being overprotective. I could've gained a sister. But instead... I just lost a brother.
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,I'm sorry!
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,princess cadance,You will be.
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"""Princess Celestia cordially invites you to the wedding of Princess Mi Amore Cadenza and..."" [gasp] My brother?"
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,shining armor,"Twily! Ah, I've missed you, kid."
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,How dare you not tell me in person that you were getting married!
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,shining armor,A threat has been made against Canterlot. Princess Celestia asked that I help provide additional protection.
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,But I'm still pretty ticked you're marrying somepony I don't even know.
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,shining armor,Princess Mi Amore Cadenza is Cadance.
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Cadance is only the most amazing pony ever!
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,princess cadance,I hope I'm not interrupting anything important.
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"Cadance, it's me! Twilight!"
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,princess cadance,[uninterested] Uh-huh.
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,shining armor,And I think I should wear it.
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,princess cadance,Are you disagreeing with me?
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,She's evil! I saw her put a spell on my brother that made his eyes go all [bells jangling]!
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,shining armor,"Cadance hasn't been casting spells on me. She's been using her magic to heal me! If I were you, I wouldn't show up to the wedding at all."
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,I just lost a brother. I'm sorry!
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,princess cadance,You will be.
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,[echoing] Hello? Is anyone there?
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Where am I?
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,princess cadance,"The caves beneath Canterlot, once home to greedy unicorns who wanted to claim the gems that could be found inside. And now, your prison."
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Help! Help!
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Plans? What plans?
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,princess cadance,"The plans I have for your brother, of course."
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"Don't you dare do anything to my brother, you... you monster!"
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,princess cadance,"No! Wait! Ugh! Please! Don't hurt me! Twilight, it's me! Please, you have to believe me. I've been imprisoned like you. The Cadance who brought you down here was an imposter."
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Likely story!
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,princess cadance,"Sunshine, sunshine, ladybugs awake. Clap your hooves..."
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,You remember me!
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,princess cadance,Of course I do. How could I forget the filly I love to sit for the most?
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,We have to get out of here. We have to stop her!
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,queen chrysalis,This day is going to be perfect The kind of day of which I've dreamed since I was small Everypony will gather 'round Say I look lovely in my gown What they don't know is that I have fooled them all!
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,princess cadance,"This day was going to be perfect The kind of day of which I've dreamed since I was small But instead of having cake With all my friends to celebrate My wedding bells, they may not ring for me at all<U+0085>"
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,queen chrysalis,"I could care less about the dress I won't partake in any cake Vows, well I'll be lying when I say"
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,princess cadance,"We must escape before it's too late Find a way to save the day Hope, I'll be lying if I say"
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,queen chrysalis,Finally the moment has arrived For me to be one lucky bride
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,princess cadance,"Oh, the wedding we won't make He'll end up marrying a fake Shining Armor will be..."
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,princess celestia,"Mares and gentlecolts, we are gathered here today to witness the union of [muffled] Princess Mi Amore Cadenza and Shining Armor."
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,princess cadance,"Oh, we're never going to save him."
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,We will. We just have to find... There!
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,princess celestia,"Princess Cadance and Shining Armor, it is my great pleasure to pronounce you<U+0096>"
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Stop!
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,queen chrysalis,Ugh! Why does she have to be so possessive of her brother? [sobbing] Why does she have to ruin my special day?
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,princess cadance,Because it's not your special day! It's mine!
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,queen chrysalis,What? But how did you escape my bridesmaids?
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,queen chrysalis,Hmph. Clever. But you're still too late.
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,applejack,I-I don't understand. How can there be two of 'em?
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,princess cadance,She's a changeling. She takes the form of somepony you love and gains power by feeding off your love for them.
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,queen chrysalis,"[laughing] Right you are, Princess. And as queen of the changelings, it is up to me to find food for my subjects. Equestria has more love than any place I've ever encountered. My fellow changelings will be able to devour so much of it that we will gain more power than we have ever dreamed of!"
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,princess cadance,They'll never get the chance! Shining Armor's protection spell will keep them from ever even reaching us!
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,queen chrysalis,"[chuckling] Oh, I doubt that. Isn't that right, dear?"
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,shining armor,Mm-hmm.
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,queen chrysalis,"Ah, ah, ah. Don't want to go back to the caves, now do you? Ever since I took your place, I've been feeding off Shining Armor's love for you. Every moment he grows weaker and so does his spell. Even now, my minions are chipping away at it."
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,queen chrysalis,"[laughing] He may not be my husband, but he is under my total control now."
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,queen chrysalis,"And I'm sorry to say, unable to perform his duties as captain of the Royal Guard."
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,princess cadance,Not my Shining Armor!
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,queen chrysalis,"Soon, my changeling army will break through. First, we take Canterlot. And then, all of Equestria!"
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,princess celestia,"No. You won't. You may have made it impossible for Shining Armor to perform his spell, but now that you have so foolishly revealed your true self, I can protect my subjects from you!"
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Princess Celestia!
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,queen chrysalis,Ah! Shining Armor's love for you is even stronger than I thought! Consuming it has made me even more powerful than Celestia!
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,princess celestia,The Elements of Harmony. You must get to them and use their power to defeat the queen.
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,queen chrysalis,"[laughing] You can run, but you can't hide!"
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"Go, go!"
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,Looks like we're gonna have to do this the hard way. How did you...?
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"They're changelings, remember?"
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Don't let them distract you. We have to get to the Elements of Harmony. They're our only hope.
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,applejack,"OK, this is just gettin' weird. Real me! Real me!"
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,"[laughing] Do me! Do me! Meh, I've seen better."
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,princess cadance,You won't get away with this! Twilight and her friends will<U+0096>
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,queen chrysalis,"You were saying? You do realize the reception's been cancelled, don't you? Go! Feed!"
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,applejack,"Sorry, Twi. We should've listened to you."
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,It's not your fault. She fooled everypony.
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,queen chrysalis,"Hmm, I did, didn't I?"
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Quick! Go to him while you still have the chance!
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,shining armor,Wha<U+0096> where... huh? Is...is the wedding over?
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,queen chrysalis,It's all over!
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Your spell! Perform your spell!
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,queen chrysalis,[laughing] What good would that do? My changelings already roam free.
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,shining armor,No! My power is useless now. I don't have the strength to repel them.
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,princess cadance,My love will give you strength.
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,queen chrysalis,[chuckling] What a lovely but absolutely ridiculous sentiment.
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,queen chrysalis,Noooooo!
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,princess celestia,Don't worry about me. I'm fine. You have a real wedding to put together.
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"Seriously, though. I get why the queen of the changelings wanted to be with you, but how did you get someone as amazing as Cadance to marry you?"
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,shining armor,"I told her she wouldn't just be gaining a husband. She'd be getting a pretty great sister, too."
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,princess celestia,"Mares and gentlecolts, we are gathered here today to celebrate the union of the real Princess Mi Amore Cadenza<U+0096>"
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,princess cadance,Princess Cadance is fine.
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,princess celestia,"Hm. The union of Princess Cadance and Shining Armor. The strength of their commitment is clear. The power of their love, undeniable. May we have the rings please? I now pronounce you mare and colt!"
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,princess celestia,"This is your victory as much as theirs. You persisted in the face of doubt, and your actions led to your being able to bring the real Princess Cadance back to us. Learning to trust your instincts is a valuable lesson to learn."
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,princess celestia,"Rainbow Dash, that's your cue."
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,Best... wedding... ever!
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,princess luna,"Hello, everypony. Did I miss anything?"
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,[squee] Let's get this party started!
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"Love is in bloom A beautiful bride, a handsome groom, Two hearts becoming one A bond that cannot be undone because"
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,shining armor,"Twilight! None of this would've been possible without you, little sis. Love ya, Twily."
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"Love you too, B.B.B.F.F."
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,shining armor,Ready to go?
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,princess cadance,Oh! Almost forgot.
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,IT'S MINE! Oof! Ahaha... ha.
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"[background] Love is in bloom A beautiful bride, a handsome groom I said love is in bloom You're starting a life and making room For us, (For us... For us... Aah...)"
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Now this was a great wedding.
The Crystal Empire - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,princess celestia,Yes?
The Crystal Empire - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,princess celestia,[gasp] Find Princess Cadance and Shining Armor.
The Crystal Empire - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,princess celestia,"My dearest Twilight, you must come to Canterlot at once."
The Crystal Empire - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"[panicked breathing] Where are all my quills? Brbrbr. No, no, no, no, no... Ugh! I need the Magical Compendium volumes 1 through 36! Where is it?!"
The Crystal Empire - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"Flash cards! I should make some flash cards. Spike, I'm gonna need you to quiz me. On everything. Everything I've ever learned. Ever. That isn't going to be enough cards."
The Crystal Empire - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,spike,"Twilight, calm down. It's just a test."
The Crystal Empire - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"Just a test? Just a test!? Princess Celestia wants to give me some kind of exam, and you're trying to tell me to calm down because it's just a test?!"
The Crystal Empire - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,spike,Uh... yes.
The Crystal Empire - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,applejack,"I'd say she's handling things pretty well, considerin'."
The Crystal Empire - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Urgh!
The Crystal Empire - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,princess luna,Are you sure you don't want me to go as well?
The Crystal Empire - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,princess celestia,Yes. Princess Cadance and Shining Armor are already there. The others will be joining them soon.
The Crystal Empire - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,princess luna,"The Empire's magic is powerful. It cannot fall again, my sister."
The Crystal Empire - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,princess celestia,"She will succeed at her task. And when she does, we'll know that she is that much closer to being ready."
The Crystal Empire - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Ahem.
The Crystal Empire - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,princess celestia,"Trust me, little sister."
The Crystal Empire - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"You wanted to see me? To give me a test? I brought my own quills and plenty of paper to show my work. Sorry, sorry!"
The Crystal Empire - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,princess celestia,This is a different kind of test. The Crystal Empire has returned.
The Crystal Empire - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"The Crystal Empire? I'm sorry, I-I thought I'd studied. Ooh. I don't think there's anything in any of my books th<U+0096>"
The Crystal Empire - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,princess celestia,"There wouldn't be. Few remember it ever existed at all. Even my knowledge of the Empire is limited. But what I do know is that it contains a powerful magic. One thousand years ago, King Sombra, a unicorn whose heart was black as night, took over the Crystal Empire."
The Crystal Empire - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,princess celestia,"He was ultimately overthrown, turned to shadow, and banished to the ice of the arctic north."
The Crystal Empire - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,princess celestia,"But not before he was able to put a curse upon the Empire. A curse that caused it to vanish into thin air. If the Empire is filled with hope and love, those things are reflected across all of Equestria. If hatred and fear take hold... Which is why I need your help finding a way to protect it."
The Crystal Empire - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,You want me to help protect an entire empire?
The Crystal Empire - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,princess celestia,"It is, as I said, a different kind of test. But one I'm certain you will pass."
The Crystal Empire - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,How do I begin?
The Crystal Empire - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,princess celestia,By joining Princess Cadance and Shining Armor in the Crystal Empire.
The Crystal Empire - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,My brother is there?
The Crystal Empire - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,princess celestia,"He is. And your Ponyville friends will join you there as well. I have every confidence you will succeed. And when you do, I'll know you are ready to move on to the next level of your studies."
The Crystal Empire - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,But what if I fail?
The Crystal Empire - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,princess celestia,You won't.
The Crystal Empire - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,But what if<U+0096>
The Crystal Empire - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,princess celestia,"You won't. But Twilight, in the end, it must be you and you alone who ultimately assists Princess Cadance and Shining Armor in doing what needs to be done to protect the Empire. Do you understand?"
The Crystal Empire - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Mm-hmm!
The Crystal Empire - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,princess celestia,Then go. There is no time to lose.
The Crystal Empire - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,spike,"Ah! Twilight! That was fast! Let me guess, you got a perfect score? A-minus? B-plus? [gasp] Twilight, did you... [quietly] fail?"
The Crystal Empire - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,I was prepared to do my best Thought I could handle any test For I can do so many tricks But I wasn't prepared for this
The Crystal Empire - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,The square root of five hundred and forty-six is twenty-three point three six six six four two eight nine one zero nine.
The Crystal Empire - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"I could ace a quiz on friendship's bliss But I wasn't prepared for this Will I fail, or will I pass? I can't be sure..."
The Crystal Empire - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,spike,She can't be sure...
The Crystal Empire - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"My mind is sharp, my skills intact My heart is pure..."
The Crystal Empire - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,spike,Her heart is pure...
The Crystal Empire - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"Oh, I've taken my share of licks I've made it through the thin and thick But no I wasn't"
The Crystal Empire - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,spike,"Oh no, she wasn't"
The Crystal Empire - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"Oh no, I wasn't"
The Crystal Empire - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,spike,"Oh no, she wasn't"
The Crystal Empire - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,No I wasn't
The Crystal Empire - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,spike,"Uh, prepared for what exactly?"
The Crystal Empire - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,applejack,"Twilight! Uh, did you pass?"
The Crystal Empire - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,Are we gonna celebrate your awesomeness with Princess Celestia?
The Crystal Empire - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Not quite. We're going to the Crystal Empire!
The Crystal Empire - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,Crystal what?
The Crystal Empire - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,Ha! And you all made fun of me for packing so many scarves.
The Crystal Empire - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,shining armor,Twilight!
The Crystal Empire - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Shining Armor?
The Crystal Empire - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,shining armor,Twily! You made it! We'd better get moving. There are things out here we really don't want to run into after dark.
The Crystal Empire - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,[gulp] What kind of things?
The Crystal Empire - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,shining armor,Let's just say the Empire... isn't the only thing that's returned.
The Crystal Empire - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,shining armor,Something keeps trying to get in! We think it's the unicorn king who originally cursed the place.
The Crystal Empire - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"But Princess Celestia said I was being sent here to find a way to protect the Empire! If King Sombra can't get in, then it must already be protected."
The Crystal Empire - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,"[gasp] Th-That's one of the things, isn't it?"
The Crystal Empire - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,shining armor,Guh. We have to get to the Crystal Empire! Now!
The Crystal Empire - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"Go, go!"
The Crystal Empire - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,shining armor,Almost there.
The Crystal Empire - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,[gasps for breath] Everypony okay?
The Crystal Empire - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"Oh, no! Shining Armor, your horn!"
The Crystal Empire - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,Sparkleriffic!
The Crystal Empire - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,It's gorgeous! Absolutely gorgeous! [mumbles incoherently] There are no words!
The Crystal Empire - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,applejack,"Focus, Rarity. We're here to help Twilight, not admire the scenery."
The Crystal Empire - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,"Eh, I don't see what the big deal is. Just looks like another old castle to me."
The Crystal Empire - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,A<U+0096> p<U+0096> guh! Another old...! Have you lost your mind? Look at the magni<U+0096>
The Crystal Empire - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,Very funny.
The Crystal Empire - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Cadance!
The Crystal Empire - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,princess cadance,Ooh.
The Crystal Empire - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Are you okay?
The Crystal Empire - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,shining armor,"Cadance has been able to use her magic to spread love and light. That seems to be what is protecting it. But she hasn't slept, barely eats. I want to help her, but my protection spell has been countered by King Sombra."
The Crystal Empire - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,princess cadance,"[breathes deeply] It's alright Shining Armor, I'm fine."
The Crystal Empire - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,shining armor,"She's not fine. She can't go on like this forever, and if her magic were to fade... Well, you saw what's out there waiting for that to happen."
The Crystal Empire - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,That's why we're here.
The Crystal Empire - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,applejack,Why we're all here.
The Crystal Empire - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,shining armor,"Well, with Cadance putting all her strength into keeping her spell going, and me trying to keep an eye on signs of trouble in the arctic, we haven't been able to gather much information from the Crystal Ponies."
The Crystal Empire - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"Crystal Ponies?! Hahaha, there are Crystal Ponies?! Um, ahem. Please continue."
The Crystal Empire - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,shining armor,But we have to believe one of them knows how we can protect the Empire without having to use Cadance's magic.
The Crystal Empire - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,A research paper!
The Crystal Empire - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,shining armor,Huh?
The Crystal Empire - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,That must be part of my test <U+0096> to gather information from the Crystal Ponies and deliver it to you! This is gonna be great! I love research papers!
The Crystal Empire - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,"[sarcastically] Yeah, who doesn't?"
The Crystal Empire - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,"Oh-oh-oh! Lemme guess! Is it Spike? Nono, Fluttershy! Rarity?"
The Crystal Empire - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"Don't worry, big brother. I am really good at this sort of thing."
The Crystal Empire - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Are you sure? Absolutely sure?
The Crystal Empire - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,King Sombra's spell must be why their coats aren't... crystally.
The Crystal Empire - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Yes.
The Crystal Empire - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"If you think of anything, even the smallest thing..."
The Crystal Empire - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,spike,"Well, that was a total bust."
The Crystal Empire - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Maybe the others are having better luck.
The Crystal Empire - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,A way to protect the Empire! You know anything about it or what?
The Crystal Empire - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,Hold on! You gotta know something!
The Crystal Empire - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,Time to gather some intel!
The Crystal Empire - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,Because it isn't!
The Crystal Empire - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,[screams] A spy? How did they know? Ah! Must have noticed my night vision goggles. Ooh! Night vision-y!
The Crystal Empire - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,[sighs] I got nothing so far.
The Crystal Empire - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"Oh, me neither."
The Crystal Empire - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,"[hushed] My cover has been blown. I repeat, my cover has been blown!"
The Crystal Empire - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Ooookay.
The Crystal Empire - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,applejack,"Sorry, Twilight. These crystal ponies seem to have some kinda collective amnesia or somethin'. Only thing I was able to get out of 'em was somethin' about a library."
The Crystal Empire - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"[gasps] A library? Well, why didn't you say so?!"
The Crystal Empire - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,applejack,Uh... thought I just did.
The Crystal Empire - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,I just... I don't even know what to... There are no words.
The Crystal Empire - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Yes. We're looking for a book.
The Crystal Empire - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,[in awe] You do. You really do.
The Crystal Empire - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,applejack,We're lookin' for a history book. Somethin' that might tell us how the Empire might've protected itself from danger back in the day.
The Crystal Empire - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"Which is where, exactly?"
The Crystal Empire - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,Ugh.
The Crystal Empire - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,We'll just take a look around. I'm sure we can find it on our own.
The Crystal Empire - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,I like her!
The Crystal Empire - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,applejack,"Uh, anyone else startin' to think this is a lost cause?"
The Crystal Empire - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"No, no, no, no, no... Yes! ""History of the Crystal Empire"". I just hope it has the answers we need."
The Crystal Empire - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"A 'Crystal Faire'. According to this book, it was established by their first queen and became their most important tradition. The Faire was held every year to ""renew the spirit of love and unity in the empire so they could protect it from harm"". My friends and I could put it together. Everything we need to know is in the book!"
The Crystal Empire - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,shining armor,That sounds pretty promising.
The Crystal Empire - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"We'll get started right away. C'mon, Spike, we've got a Crystal Faire to put together!"
The Crystal Empire - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Princess Cadance needs our help Her magic will not last forever I think we can do it But we need to work together
The Crystal Empire - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,It says that they liked jousting
The Crystal Empire - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,They flew a flag of many hues
The Crystal Empire - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,applejack,Made sweets of crystal berries
The Crystal Empire - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,They had a petting zoo with tiny ewes
The Crystal Empire - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,There was a crystal flugelhorn That every pony liked to play
The Crystal Empire - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,And the Crystal Kingdom anthem Can you learn it in a day?
The Crystal Empire - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"It looks amazing! I don't know how I could've done this without you! One last check to make sure everything is in place, and then the festivities can begin!"
The Crystal Empire - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,applejack,What's this thing for?
The Crystal Empire - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"The last page of the book mentioned a Crystal Heart as the faire's centerpiece, so I used my magic to cut one out of a crystal block."
The Crystal Empire - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,applejack,"Nice work, Twi. Think we're ready to get this faire up and runnin'."
The Crystal Empire - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"Hear ye, hear<U+0096>"
The Crystal Empire - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,[blows flugelhorn] Flugelhorn! [laughs nervously] My bad.
The Crystal Empire - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"Ahem. Hear ye, hear ye! Princess Cadance and Prince Shining Armor do cordially invite you to attend the Crystal Faire!"
The Crystal Empire - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,applejack,"Come on in, y'all. Got food and drinks thataway, games and crafts are thataway, Crystal Heart to the back near the Princess."
The Crystal Empire - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,"We totally nailed it, right? Must be feeling a lot of love and unity about now! Gonna have some grub, huh? What are you thinking? Crystal Empire berry pie? Maybe some crystal corn-on-the-cob! [pause] What is with these ponies?!"
The Crystal Empire - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,"Of course we have it! Can't have a Crystal Faire without the Crystal Heart, right?"
The Crystal Empire - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,W-what's that about 'powering the heart'?
The Crystal Empire - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Why did you<U+0096>
The Crystal Empire - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,I think we may have a problem...
The Crystal Empire - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,I didn't know it was an actual relic! The book didn't mention anything about the Crystal Ponies powering the Heart! There was a page missing... How did I not notice?!
The Crystal Empire - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,princess cadance,"It's alright, Twilight."
The Crystal Empire - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,shining armor,Twily...
The Crystal Empire - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,You wanted to see me? To give me a test?
The Crystal Empire - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,princess celestia,The Crystal Empire has returned.
The Crystal Empire - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,You want me to help protect an entire empire?
The Crystal Empire - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,princess celestia,It must be you and you alone.
The Crystal Empire - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,But what if I fail?
The Crystal Empire - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,shining armor,Let's just say the Empire... isn't the only thing that's returned.
The Crystal Empire - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"Go, go!"
The Crystal Empire - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,Sparkleriffic!
The Crystal Empire - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,shining armor,"Well, with Cadance putting all her strength into keeping her spell going, and me trying to keep an eye on signs of trouble in the arctic, we haven't been able to gather much information from the Crystal Ponies."
The Crystal Empire - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,There are Crystal Ponies?!
The Crystal Empire - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"""History of the Crystal Empire"". The last page of the book mentioned a Crystal Heart as the Faire's centerpiece, so I used my magic to cut one out of a crystal block."
The Crystal Empire - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,I think we may have a problem...
The Crystal Empire - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,I didn't know it was an actual relic!
The Crystal Empire - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,princess cadance,"It's alright, Twilight."
The Crystal Empire - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,shining armor,Twily...
The Crystal Empire - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,shining armor,The Empire is under attack.
The Crystal Empire - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,shining armor,I have to find the Crystal Heart!
The Crystal Empire - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"No, you stay here with Cadance. She needs you, Shining Armor. I'll retrieve the Heart."
The Crystal Empire - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,Let's do this!
The Crystal Empire - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,I've been trying to figure out how I'm meant to pass Celestia's test. Retrieving the Crystal Heart must be it. But there is something else you can do.
The Crystal Empire - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,Name it.
The Crystal Empire - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,You and the rest of our friends have to keep the Faire going.
The Crystal Empire - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,What? With that thing moving into the Empire?
The Crystal Empire - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"The whole purpose of the Crystal Faire is to lift the spirits of the Crystal Ponies, so they can activate the Crystal Heart."
The Crystal Empire - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,"Yeah, and?"
The Crystal Empire - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"If the Crystal Ponies find out that King Sombra is trying to take over the Empire again, their spirits are gonna be anything but lifted. It won't matter if I find the Crystal Heart. They won't be able to make it work. You have to keep them happy here at the Faire."
The Crystal Empire - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,Keep the Faire going and the Crystal Ponies' spirits high. Done and done!
The Crystal Empire - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,shining armor,"Twily, be careful."
The Crystal Empire - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,I will.
The Crystal Empire - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,spike,[under his breath] Uh-huh. We can do that. Twilight's doing what?!
The Crystal Empire - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,He... really... loves getting his face painted. Haha.
The Crystal Empire - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,Who wants a flugelhorn?
The Crystal Empire - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,I want a flugelhorn!
The Crystal Empire - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,<U+00A0>Who else wants a flugelhorn?
The Crystal Empire - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,[screaming]<U+00A0>I want a flugelhorn!!
The Crystal Empire - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,spike,"[pants] Twilight, wait! I'm coming with you!"
The Crystal Empire - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,You can't. I have to retrieve the Crystal Heart by myself.
The Crystal Empire - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,spike,I know. I promise I won't lift a claw to help you.
The Crystal Empire - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"[sighs] Not a claw, Spike."
The Crystal Empire - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,spike,Where are we going exactly?
The Crystal Empire - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,I think I might know where King Sombra hid the Crystal Heart.
The Crystal Empire - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,spike,The castle?
The Crystal Empire - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,The king would've been counting on the fact that nopony would dare come looking for it here. They'd have been too afraid to even try.
The Crystal Empire - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,spike,I hope you're right.
The Crystal Empire - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,You and me both.
The Crystal Empire - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,What are you lookin' at?! That's what I thought!
The Crystal Empire - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,applejack,"[whispering] Uh, Rainbow Dash? We're supposed to be actin' like nothing's wrong."
The Crystal Empire - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,applejack,"[hushed] What I mean is, maybe you should let me keep the Crystal Ponies away from the fake Heart, while you show off your joustin' skills."
The Crystal Empire - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,Huh. Seeing my awesomeness does have a way of putting ponies into a pretty good mood.
The Crystal Empire - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,"Come on, Knight Fluttershy."
The Crystal Empire - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,Huh?
The Crystal Empire - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,It's showtime.
The Crystal Empire - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,applejack,How are y'all feelin'? Havin' a good time?
The Crystal Empire - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,applejack,"Well, that's good! Gotta renew that spirit of love and unity if you're gonna power up that Crystal Heart, right?"
The Crystal Empire - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,applejack,"Oh, I hear ya, but, uh... phew! Gettin' a little toasty out here. Bet you'd like to cool off with a little Crystal Empire nectar! [panicked noise] Uh, you tried the Crystal Empire fritters yet? Made from a traditional Crystal Empire recipe! You're gonna love 'em! [loudly] Uh, I hear there's a joustin' match about to start! You don't wanna miss that! [hushed] Come on, Twilight... These Crystal Ponies are more curious than a cat!"
The Crystal Empire - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"It's gotta be here somewhere. It's just gotta be! Not a claw, Spike."
The Crystal Empire - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Celestia's orders!
The Crystal Empire - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Of course!
The Crystal Empire - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,spike,[panting for breath] Argh! What? Did you find it?
The Crystal Empire - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,No. Because this isn't King Sombra's castle.
The Crystal Empire - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,spike,"Well, isn't this where he lived when he was in power?"
The Crystal Empire - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,spike,Whoa. When did you learn to do that?
The Crystal Empire - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,That was a little trick Celestia taught me.
The Crystal Empire - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,You stay here.
The Crystal Empire - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,spike,"Huh, if you insist. [echoing] Can you see what's down there yet?"
The Crystal Empire - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,[echoing] Not yet. I can't even tell how far down this goes!
The Crystal Empire - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Spike?
The Crystal Empire - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,spike,[echoing] Yeah?
The Crystal Empire - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,[echoing] Can you see outside?
The Crystal Empire - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,spike,It's not good! Cadance's magic must be fading [echoing] faster than before!
The Crystal Empire - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,spike,[echoing] Twilight? Are you okay?
The Crystal Empire - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Yes...
The Crystal Empire - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"Spike, I think it's here! Huh?"
The Crystal Empire - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,princess celestia,What are you doing here?
The Crystal Empire - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,I don't know! I opened the door and<U+0096>
The Crystal Empire - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,princess celestia,And now you must go.
The Crystal Empire - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Go where?
The Crystal Empire - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,princess celestia,"Doesn't matter to me. You failed the test, Twilight!"
The Crystal Empire - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,I don't understand! The test?
The Crystal Empire - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,princess celestia,"Not only will you not move on to the next level of your studies, you won't continue your studies at all!"
The Crystal Empire - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,I... You didn't say anything about no longer being your student if I failed!
The Crystal Empire - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,princess celestia,Didn't I?
The Crystal Empire - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,But... what do I do now?
The Crystal Empire - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,spike,"[incredibly distant and muffled] Twilight! [closer] Twilight? Twilight! Twiliiiight! [quickly] I know you told me to stay up there, but you were down here for such a long time and you weren't answering and I got worried so I came down here and you were just staring at that wall and... I was calling your name, but I couldn't seem to get your attention, and<U+0096> What were you looking at? I mean... it's just a wall. ...Ponyville?! Well, how did I get... No! I don't wanna go! Please, Twilight, don't make me!"
The Crystal Empire - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,King Sombra's dark magic. A doorway that leads to your worst fear.
The Crystal Empire - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,spike,We were home. You told me you didn't need me anymore. You were sending me away...
The Crystal Empire - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,A fear that will never come to pass. I'm never gonna send you away. And I'm not gonna fail my test!
The Crystal Empire - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,spike,What's in there?
The Crystal Empire - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,[sighs] Stairs. Lots and lots of stairs. [sighs] Maybe you should come with me this time.
The Crystal Empire - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,[nervous exhale] [catching breath] Isn't there... somepony else who could... take over the jousting demonstration with you?
The Crystal Empire - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,"[scoffs] The fate of an entire empire rests on us showing these ponies a good time. But, y'know, if that isn't important to you..."
The Crystal Empire - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,"[sigh] Okay, okay, I'll take it easy on you next time. But not too easy. I've got a reputation to maintain!"
The Crystal Empire - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,spike,[panting] What if this is just more of his magic? He makes a door that leads to your worst nightmare. Why not a staircase that goes on forever?
The Crystal Empire - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Hold on to me.
The Crystal Empire - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,spike,Uh...
The Crystal Empire - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,[sounds of exertion] Whoa. Whoaaa! Yaaaah!
The Crystal Empire - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"[laughs nervously] Excuse me, pardon me... [hushed] I am running out of weaving materials for the traditional crafts booth! I just made a hat out of three pieces of hay and a drinking straw! I made it work. But still!"
The Crystal Empire - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,applejack,"We gotta do everything we can to keep this thing goin'. The Princess isn't lookin' so good. I can't imagine her magic is gonna last much longer. It's gonna be fine. These ponies are gonna power up that Crystal Heart when the time comes, and we won't be needin' her magic anyway."
The Crystal Empire - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"[laughs nervously] Oh, of course it isn't. The real one is<U+0096>"
The Crystal Empire - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,applejack,On its way!
The Crystal Empire - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,[hushed] I was going to say 'being polished' to buy us some more time?
The Crystal Empire - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,applejack,Oops.
The Crystal Empire - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,The Heart... Where's the Crystal<U+0096>
The Crystal Empire - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,spike,Here! It rolled over to me when you dropped it!
The Crystal Empire - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Don't move!
The Crystal Empire - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"You can move, just not toward me! How could I have been so foolish? I was just so eager to get it! Then when I saw what was going on outside, I..."
The Crystal Empire - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,spike,"You have to get out of there, Twilight! You have to be the one who brings the Heart to Princess Cadance! If you don't, you'll fail Celestia's test!"
The Crystal Empire - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"King Sombra is already attacking the Empire. He could reach the Crystal Ponies at any moment... reach Princess Cadance, my brother, my friends. There may not be enough time for me to find a way to escape."
The Crystal Empire - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,You have to be the one to bring the Crystal Heart to the Faire.
The Crystal Empire - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,spike,Me? But Twilight<U+0096>
The Crystal Empire - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Go!
The Crystal Empire - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,spike,But<U+0096>
The Crystal Empire - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Goooo!
The Crystal Empire - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,applejack,"Now, don't y'all worry your pretty, little Crystal heads! The real Crystal Heart will be here any second!"
The Crystal Empire - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,[hushed] I don't know if they believe you...
The Crystal Empire - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,applejack,[hushed] Don't know if I believe me...
The Crystal Empire - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,spike,Whoa! Huh! [spits fire] Yah! [nervous noise] Hey! Up here!
The Crystal Empire - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,Spike?
The Crystal Empire - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,spike,I got the Crystal Heart!
The Crystal Empire - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,[gasps] Spikey-wikey!
The Crystal Empire - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,princess cadance,The Crystal Heart has returned. Use the light and love within you to ensure that King Sombra does not.
The Crystal Empire - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"[sighs] Good job, Spike."
The Crystal Empire - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,I do so wish it was permanent. Did you see how my mane just absolutely sparkled?
The Crystal Empire - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,applejack,But... good things are better when they're a rarity.
The Crystal Empire - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,shining armor,Everything's gonna be okay. You've gotta stop saving my rump like this. It's starting to get embarrassing.
The Crystal Empire - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Wasn't me who saved you in the end. It was Spike.
The Crystal Empire - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,shining armor,It's just a test. Maybe she'll let you retake it.
The Crystal Empire - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,I don't think she's gonna give me a new test.
The Crystal Empire - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,spike,"[breathing heavily] [to himself] Keep it together, buddy... Gotta stay strong... for Twilight..."
The Crystal Empire - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,princess celestia,It's beautiful.
The Crystal Empire - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,I wish it had been me who ultimately made it so. But it wasn't.
The Crystal Empire - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,princess celestia,"Twilight, as I understand it, Spike brought Princess Cadance the Crystal Heart because you weren't sure how quickly you could find a way to escape the tower. You weren't willing to risk the future of the citizens of the Crystal Empire in an effort to guarantee your own. Far better that I have a student who understands the meaning of self-sacrifice than one who only looks out for her own best interests."
The Crystal Empire - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Does this mean...?
The Crystal Empire - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,spike,"She's totally gonna lose it! [breathes heavily] Keep it together, buddy... Gotta stay strong... for Twilight...!"
The Crystal Empire - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,I passed!
The Crystal Empire - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Ooh.
The Crystal Empire - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,You were prepared to do your best Had what it takes to pass the test All those doubts you can dismiss Turns out you were
The Crystal Empire - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,applejack,You clearly have just what it takes
The Crystal Empire - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,To pass a test with such high stakes
The Crystal Empire - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,We knew for sure you would prevail
The Crystal Empire - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,Since when does Twilight Sparkle ever fail?
The Crystal Empire - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Turns out I was
The Crystal Empire - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Turns out I was
The Crystal Empire - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,Turns out you were
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,spike,"Try again, Twi, you can do it!"
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"Phew, this spell's a toughie. But I feel lucky this time! One, two..."
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,Hi!
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"Nnnnnng! Pinkie, why'd you do that?!"
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,"'Cause hugs are funneriffic, especially when you throw one around a friend. Whatcha doin'?"
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,Trying to turn that apple into an orange!
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,spike,But you kinda threw her aim off...
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,"Wheee! [giggles] What a cute orange birdie! Do me next, Twilight! Do me, do me!"
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,"Ooooh, Rarity, wanna see Twilight turn me into an orange? It's gonna be funna-fun-fuuun!"
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,rarity,"As fun as creating this haute couture ensemble that I just finished making? Delightful, non?"
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,[gasps] This is terrible!
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,rarity,"I admit it's perhaps not my finest work, but I<U+0096>"
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,You had total-awesome-amazing fun and I missed out on it?! Neh! Wait! What if there's more awesome amazing fun with friends happening somewhere in Ponyville right now that I'm missing out on too?!
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,spike,We weren't going to turn her into an orange! I swear!
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,"Hey, Rainbow Dash, whatcha doing?"
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,This punk cloud got so heavy it's making fog. Figure I'll thin this bad boy out so it floats back up.
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,"Oooh, fun! Wheeeeee! Gotta go!"
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,"Uh, thanks, Pinkie...?"
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,"Hey, Applejack! That looks like fun, can I join you? Wheee! Next time I'll pull you!"
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,Fluttershy! [panting] There... you... are...! Doing... [deep breath] anything... [deep breath] fun?
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,fluttershy,Not especially.
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,fluttershy,"Feeling better, Pinkie?"
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,Abso-tutely-lutely! Thanks for letting me rest in your butterfly grove while I get my Pinkie strength back!
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,fluttershy,What are friends for?
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,"That's just the thing! I've got so many wonderful friends having fun in every last corner of Ponyville, I can't figure out how to keep up with it all! It's driving me even more coco-loco than usual!"
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,fluttershy,I can promise to not do anything fun at all if that would help.
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,You are such a good friend.
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,applejack,"There you are, Pinkie. Been lookin' everywhere for ya, girl."
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,"Hey, Pinkie. Got something fun planned this afternoon thought you might wanna know about."
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,applejack,"Heh. Well, I'll be an apple crisp. I'm here for the same reason."
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,"This is perfect! Everyone will now bring their fun to me. Ha, this'll solve everything! Why didn't I think of that?"
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,"Actually, what I meant is after I'm done whipping up today's weather, I'll be chilling by the lake catching some rays. Wanna hang?"
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,I am so there. Wheee.
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,applejack,And my family's havin' a barn-raisin' this afternoon at Sweet Apple Acres.
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,"And I'm also so there. Whee, whee."
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,"But... that's when I'll be at the swimming hole. Ah, well, doesn't matter. Whichever one you choose is okay with me."
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,applejack,Me too.
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,[gasps] Choose?
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"One, two..."
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"Pinkie! What in the wide, wide world of Equestria are you doing now?"
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,"Timing myself galloping back and forth between the swimming hole and Sweet Apple Acres. I'm trying to cut down my time so if Rainbow Dash dives off the swing, I can get to Sweet Apple Acres to help with the barn raising, and then be back in time to see Rainbow Dash hit the water after doing a double flip! [sigh] If I can cut my time by only twenty minutes, I'm good."
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"[laughs] Oh, Pinkie. I'm afraid no matter how hard you try, the only way to pull something like that off is if there's more of you to go around."
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,"That's it, Twilight! The legend of the Mirror Pool!"
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"Legend of the who-what now? Pinkie! I'm familiar with loads of legends, and I never heard of<U+0096>"
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,spike,Does this mean practice is over?
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,Of course not! Back to work.
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,"Seems like hardly anypony's been here in ages. I hope I'm remembering the rhymes right from my Nana Pinkie's story. ""Where the brambles are thickest, there you will find a pond beyond the most twisted of vines!"" [echoes] What was that?! Oh, I heard a voice! Oh. Hehe. It was me. Ouch! Ooh! Stop scratching me up, you brambles, and<U+0096> Whoooaaa!"
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,"[gasp] The Mirror Pool! [echoes] Oh, and there's that voice again! Tsk, tsk, tsk. Ah Pinkie, you have got to stop talking to yourself. Starting... now. ""And into her own reflection she stared, uh, yearning for one whose reflection she shared, and solemnly sweared not to be scared at the prospect of being doubly mared!"""
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,"Wow, the legend is true. It really worked!"
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,"Okay, wait. I promised not talk to myself anymore. I should say something to her. Or... would that still be talking to myself? Excuse me, me? Can I have a word with you? Uh, I mean, me? Listen, I can see you're having lots of fun, but<U+0096>"
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,"I did, over here!"
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,"Whoa, calm yourself, Pinkie, there's loads of fun to be had in Ponyville with my girls! Trot on over back to Ponyville with me and I'll tell you all about 'em."
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,"...And then there's Rarity. She's the one with all the fancy clothes and ribbons and stuff! I'm thinking she can make us all matching t-shirts that say 'Team Pinkie', and<U+0096>"
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,"Uh, well, let's see, Applejack's having a barn raising at<U+0096>"
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,It's that-away!
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,"Wait, come back! Don't forget to meet me back here to tell me everything about everything, like I was there myself! Because I'm you and, and you're me, and<U+0096> Oh, my gosh! This is the greatest plan ever! [squee] Now, off to double my fun!"
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,"Let's rock this pool, ponies! [blows up inflatable] Whee!"
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,"Coming in, Dashie? The water's great, it's totally wet and everything!"
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,I don't know... Cloud busting was tougher work than usual today. [yawns] I'm kind of exhausted.
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,"That's fine, you relax. At least we'll still be together!"
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,"Glad you made it, Pinkie. I thought you maybe went to Applejack's, instead."
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,I did.
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,Oh. The barn up yet?
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,I have no idea.
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,But I thought you said you were just at Applejack's.
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,"Actually, I'm probably still on my way there now! Whee!"
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,fluttershy,"Oh, Pinkie Pie, I'm so glad you wandered by. I know I promised not to have any fun today, but, oh, I couldn't help myself. All of my critter friends wanted a picnic, and I couldn't disappoint them. Come join us. We have plenty of hay juice and marmalade to go around, don't we, critters?"
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,fluttershy,Who's Applejohn?
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,fluttershy,Walls? But we're outside.
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,fluttershy,Goodness. Was it something I said?
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,fluttershy,Huh?
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,"So you see, that's how I'm able to have fun in two places at once."
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,"Duplicates of you, huh? Heh, yeah, sure, Pinkie. [yawns] Look, I was just gearing up to catch some Z's, so, uh..."
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,Gotcha. I'll have the rest of my fun really quietly. [quietly] Wheeeee...
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,How'd you do that?
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,"Just trying to show a little consideration for my sleepy friend. Ooh, ooh, gotta run. Looks like I'm trying to get my attention. Excuse me."
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,"Ooh, ooh, tell me all about it! Did they pull the walls of the barn up slow or fast?"
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,"Maybe slow to medium fast, somewhere in that range?"
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,"Ooh, did you get ice cream? What kinds did they have? Banana brickle?"
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,Fluttershy.
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,"Aw, how could you say no to that?"
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,Applejack.
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,"Aw, my poor poor me! There, there. Tell me what, we just need a couple more Pinkie Pies. Easy peasy."
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,"Come on, would I lie to me?"
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,"I think you mean a double-double me. Plus another double-double me, which makes two double-double mes, or a double-double-double me, if you will."
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,"Now Applejack, Rainbow Dash, and Fluttershy are covered, plus one extra Pinkie Pie in case we get an extra invite from somepony else. Perfect! Okay, let's go! [under] Hey, Pinkies! Yoo-hoo!"
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,"Okay, good enough. Pinkie Pies, move it out<U+0096>"
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,What in the name of pink?! Knock it off!
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,"To Ponyville, everyone! Follow me!"
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,"[sighs] Yes, it's fun there."
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,"[whistles] Okay, between the bunch of us, we should have every nook and cranny of fun in Ponyville covered at all times. An unprecedented and massive undertaking! But first, a pop quiz on the names I taught you!"
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,"Excellent. Okay, let's get on with this, folks. Fan out on three. One<U+0096>"
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,"Eh, good enough. La-la-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la, whee!"
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,[sneezes] What the<U+0096>
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,Wow! Pinkie Pie wasn't kidding about the duplicates! Except now there's triplicates... and quadruplicates!
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,"Dash is gonna love this! Aw, if I push her around on this floaty thing, it'll be fun and relaxing!"
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,Uh-oh...
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,No more Pinkies! I can't take it!
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,"Gosh, uh... I wonder what fun they're having raising the barn at Applejack's right now! Maybe I'd better go check!"
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,applejack,No!
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,"Oh, phew! Looks like I haven't missed a thing!"
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,applejack,"I wanna know right now where all you Pinkies came from, so I can find out who's responsible for y'all ruinin' our barn raisin'!"
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,"Uh, you look pretty busy right now, so [laughs nervously] maybe we should talk a little later?"
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,applejack,Y'all come back here and clean up after yourselves this instant!
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,"Oh no, what have I done, what have I done?! My poor friends..."
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"Okay, everypony, please, calm down!"
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,rarity,Calm down? I just had a Pinkie hurricane raging through my shop!
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,fluttershy,And they trashed our critter picnic!
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"Please, everypony, hang on while I try to figure something out! Come on, Spike. I've gotta try to remember the name of that legend she mentioned."
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"Aha, here it is! ""The legend of the Mirror Pond""... It describes a spell I can use to send them back where they came from!"
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,spike,That's perfect! Let's go!
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"But there's a catch. If I can't figure out which one's the real Pinkie, I might send her back by mistake!"
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,spike,"Well, we'll just have to figure out who the real one is then. Shouldn't be too hard."
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,Does anypony here know how we can tell the real Pinkie Pie from all the rest of them?
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,"Twilight! I have to talk to you, I need your help!"
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"Excuse me, whoever you are, but I'm not talking to any of you Pinkies unless you're the real Pinkie."
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,"Oh, but, but I am the real Pinkie!"
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,applejack,How in tarnation are we supposed to tell which is the real Pinkie?
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,I have no idea.
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"Ugh, this is hopeless!"
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,spike,Maybe that one's the real Pinkie.
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,Please. The real Pinkie Pie never sat that long in one place her whole life!
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,spike,I'm gonna go ask.
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,Of course she's gonna say she's the real Pinkie! They all do! You're wasting your time.
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,spike,So lemme guess. You're the real Pinkie Pie.
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,"Heck if I know. Could be any one of us if you ask me. And if I said I was the real Pinkie, you wouldn't even believe me anyway. So just leave me alone. I've got some important poking the ground with my hoof to do."
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"Oh, Spike, how're we gonna do this? I can't risk sending the real Pinkie back into the pond!"
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,spike,I miss the real Pinkie.
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,"[sighs] I bet she misses you too. Bet she'd do just about anything to get to be with her friends again. Hey. Hey! What if you gave them a test? Pick something really hard for a Pinkie to do, something not fun at all! Any Pinkie that can't do it goes back into the pond. But whoever wants to stay the most, that must be the real Pinkie!"
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"You know, that's not a bad idea."
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,"Hey, Twilight!"
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,I've been looking all over for you ponies. What are you all doing here?
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,"Fluttershy spoke with the woodland critters, and they've agreed to take us into their home 'til the Pinkie storm dies down."
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"You guys, we're gonna fix this. And I know exactly how."
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,fluttershy,Are we gonna lose our real Pinkie Pie?
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,I don't think so. Now come along. I've already got Applejack and her family rounding up all the Pinkies.
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,applejack,"Hyah, ya Pinkies! Hyah!"
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,applejack,"Oh, give it a rest."
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"Welcome, Pinkies, welcome. Please have a seat and make yourselves comfortable. [pause] Okay, I suppose you can't be comfortable staying in one place, but have a seat anyway. [pause] Sit down!"
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"Better. Now, I suppose you're all wondering why I've gathered you all here today."
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"No, just the opposite actually."
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,"Wait up, I got one more! Found this one poking at the ground with her hoof, drawing frowny faces."
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,Have her come sit with the others.
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"Pinkies, you've been brought here to take a test."
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"Don't worry, it's a simple test, about as simple as they come, and whoever passes gets to stay."
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"Curtain, please. The test... will be watching paint dry!"
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"On your mark, get set, go!"
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,spike,"Ooh, this is so exciting!"
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,spike,"Okay, maybe not that exciting."
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,"Ugh, I can't take it anymore! Somepony's making balloon animals!"
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"Pinkie, you can look away now."
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,I passed?
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,You passed. You're the only Pinkie who kept staring at the wall.
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,"I had to. I just had to. I couldn't leave my friends, I just couldn't. But I guess sometimes I will have to choose between them."
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,I knew you'd be up to the challenge.
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,"I'm me! I'm me! I'm me! Or am I? Yeah, I'm pretty sure I am."
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,"Dear Princess Celestia,"
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,"It's great to have fun, but it's even greater to have great friends. And having lots of friends means that you sometimes have to make choices as to who you'll spend your time with. But that's okay, because good friends will always give you lots of opportunities to have fun. So even if you're missing out, it's never for long."
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"Hi, Pinkie Pie. We were thinking we should go out and celebrate."
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,applejack,You up for some wheelbarrow races?
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,Or I could take everypony on a cloud ride!
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,rarity,I could throw a party with punch and zesty cucumber sandwiches! Ooh!
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,fluttershy,That looks like fun.
Too Many Pinkie Pies,Dave Polsky,applejack,"Oh, Pinkie."
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,"[whining] What to wear, what to wear? Oh, what to wear?!"
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,applejack,"Scoot your boot, Apple Bloom. It's not like it's the Harvest Day Parade! We're just goin' to the train station!"
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,Too casual. Too summery.
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,applejack,[sigh] Your cousin isn't gonna care what you're wearin'. Just pick somethin'!
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,"This is my first time meetin' her, and she's from Manehattan. I wanna make a good impression!"
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,applejack,You know what would make a good impression?
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,What?
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,applejack,Bein' on time to pick her up!
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,applejack,"You got nothin' to worry about, sugarcube. Y'all are gonna get along great. You already have somethin' in common."
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,"[muffled, through snorkel] Oh, yeah? What's that?"
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,applejack,Neither of you have your cutie mark.
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,What?! How could you forget to tell me somethin' like that?
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,applejack,"Well, I<U+0096>"
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,"Oh, this changes everything! Meet you at the train station! I'm gonna go tell Sweetie Belle and Scootaloo!"
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,applejack,"You know, your cousin is supposed to sleep in here!"
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,scootaloo,Do you really think she'll wanna join?
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,She doesn't have her cutie mark. Of course she'll wanna join the Cutie Mark Crusaders!
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,I'm just so excited I could burst!
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,Is that the train from Manehattan?
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,applejack,Yep.
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,"That's her! Oh, wait, no, no, that's not her. Oh! No, tha-tha-that's her! Um, no. Oh, wait, tha<U+0096> that's not her either, uh..."
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,applejack,"Apple Bloom, you've never met Babs Seed, remember?"
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,Oh... [laughs nervously] Yeah.
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,applejack,"Ah, that's her!"
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,"Babs! Babs! It's me, your cousin, Apple Bloom! And this is Sweetie Belle, and this is Scootaloo, and we are so, so, so glad you're here!"
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,babs seed,"Thanks, I'm happy to<U+0096>"
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,This is gonna be the best week of your life!
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,babs seed,Sure hope it's gonna be<U+0096>
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,scootaloo,"Seriously, we are gonna have a blast."
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,The Summer Harvest Parade's going on while you're here! You'll get to ride in a float!
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,babs seed,Really? I've never been on a float before.
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,And we've got a really big surprise for you!
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,babs seed,Yeah... uh... a surprise?
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,I give you... the Cutie Mark Crusaders Clubhouse!
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,babs seed,The Cutie Mark Crusaders?
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,scootaloo,A club devoted to helping ponies get their cutie marks! We're its founding members.
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,"Technically, we're its only members."
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,"But we're always looking to expand, and you seem like the perfect candidate!"
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,babs seed,I do?
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,scootaloo,"Well, yeah, since you don't have a cutie mark and all."
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,babs seed,"Oh, yeah... [blows] That..."
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,"Allow me to show you just some of the highlights of our clubhouse, should you choose to join us."
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,This is where we do our role call...
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,This is where we eat our lunch...
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,Sometimes we stand here and think of great ideas.
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,babs seed,"Yeah, uh..."
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,"Uh, could you excuse us for a moment?"
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,babs seed,Sure...
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,[hushed] Thought she'd be more impressed.
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,"[hushed] She's from Manehattan. If we wanna impress her, we need to really wow her!"
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,cutie mark crusaders,Hmmmm.
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,scootaloo,[gasps] [hushed] The float! She can ride with us on our Summer Harvest Parade float!
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,[hushed] That's perfect! This really is a good spot for thinking up great ideas.
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,cutie mark crusaders,Mm-hmm.
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,Here it is! The official Cutie Mark Crusaders float for the Summer Harvest Parade!
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,scootaloo,"As a member of the Cutie Mark Crusaders, you'd be able to ride on it with us! It'd be totally fun."
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,diamond tiara,More like funny...
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,silver spoon,"What is that thing, a giant orange?"
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,It's a pumpkin.
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,diamond tiara,More like a lame-kin.
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,diamond tiara,Who's the new blank flank?
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,"She's mah cousin, Babs. She's from Manehattan!"
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,diamond tiara,"Manehattan, huh? Well, I guess you have that going for you."
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,silver spoon,Suppose you're gonna join their little club? What's it called? The [mockingly] Cutie Mark Crusaders?
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,Hey!!
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,diamond tiara,"Oooo, heh, big city attitude! I like it!"
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,silver spoon,Mm-hmm!
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,scootaloo,"Oh no, she didn't!"
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,babs seed,Looks like somepony's pumpkin just got squashed!
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,When ah tell Applejack<U+0096>
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,babs seed,You gonna tell Applejack what?
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,"W-well, y'know, uh..."
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,babs seed,"What're you, a snitch?"
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,diamond tiara,"Come on, Babs, you should hang with us! Y'know, the cool ponies, not these babies!"
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,What... just happened?
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,scootaloo,I think Babs just went to the dark side.
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,We have to tell Applejack!
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,No! We're not snitches!
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,scootaloo,Yeah! And we're not babies!
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,Then... why do I feel like crying?
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,scootaloo,I still can't believe she ruined our pumpkin float.
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,I still can't believe I'm related to such a big stinkin' bully!
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,[sighs] What are we gonna do?
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,"We're gonna build a new float, that's what."
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,scootaloo,"Why bother? She'll probably just ruin that one, too."
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,We could always tell Applejack.
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,babs seed,"[echoing] What are you, a snitch?"
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,"We're not gonna be a bunch of tattle-tales! Besides, she's only here a couple of weeks. We'll just avoid her like the plague until she goes home."
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,scootaloo,"Avoid her. Yeah, how hard can that be?"
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,"First, we thought that Babs was so really, really sweet A new friend to have, and it seemed like such a treat"
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,scootaloo,"But then, we found the truth; she's just a bully from the east She went from Babs, yeah, to a bully and a beast"
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,"Everywhere we turn, she's just a step ahead"
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,"Hiding from a bully, we know it isn't right But the Cutie Mark Crusaders, we aren't lookin' for a fight"
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,scootaloo,"Oh, she'll go home soon, and then we'll have some peace again But for now, we're staying out of her way 'til then"
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,"Everywhere we turn, she's just a step ahead"
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,scootaloo,"She's just a bad, bad seed!"
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,"Babs may have run us out of town, but at least we still have the club<U+0096>"
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,babs seed,Hey! What're you doing at my clubhouse?
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,scootaloo,Y- y- your clubhouse?! This is our clubhouse!
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,babs seed,"Well, it was yours, and now it's mine."
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,silver spoon,And mine.
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,diamond tiara,And mine.
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,"That's not fair, Babs! We never did anything to you!"
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,babs seed,"And let's keep it that way. Now scram, crybabies!"
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,That Babs has really gone too far this time!
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,scootaloo,Kicked out of our own clubhouse!
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,And my own bed!
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,scootaloo,Seriously?
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,Super-seriously.
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,We need to talk to Applejack.
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,Rarity?
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,Twilight?
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,"No, no, no! We need to fight back!"
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,scootaloo,Yeah! Fight back! How're we gonna do that?
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,[gasp] By makin' her the guest of honor at the Summer Harvest Parade!
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,scootaloo,"[gasps] Yeah! Wait, what?"
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,[laughs under her breath] When you look up 'embarrassed' in the dictionary... [deep breath] Her face will be there!
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,Moo! Moo!
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,Moo! Moo!
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,Are those from the Carousel Boutique?
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,Yup.
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,Excellent.
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,Ooh!
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,scootaloo,Luster dust from Sugarcube Corner. They use it for decorating cakes.
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,That must be what Rarity uses on her emergency edible boots!
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,scootaloo,"The gears and bands for the moving mechanism, my tools and stuff... Did you bring the thing from the place?"
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,What's that?
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,Granny Smith's kitchen timer.
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,What's that for?
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,"C'mon, y'all, let's get to it. We only got a few hours before mornin', and this thing has to look so good, Babs won't be able to resist wanting to ride in it!"
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,[yawns] Is this it?
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,scootaloo,[tired] I think... we're a go.
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,"[tired] Good, 'cause we'd better get out of here before Babs finds us."
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,cutie mark crusaders,"[tired] Cutie Mark Crusaders, ho!"
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,babs seed,[blows] Whoaaaa...
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,"Isn't it smashing? No! I-I didn't mean smashing! I mean... Isn't it a hit? No! No, I- No! No hitting! I meant<U+0096>"
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,scootaloo,"Well, don't even think about riding it, Babs."
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,Ow!
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,scootaloo,You had your chance.
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,babs seed,"See ya later, Cutie Mark Crybabies!"
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,[hushed] The timer set?
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,Teach her to fool with the Cutie Mark Crusaders!
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,applejack,Y'all are letting Babs ride in your golden apple float?
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,Yeah. We thought she deserved to be the... center of attention.
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,applejack,"Well, that's just super sweet of y'all, makin' Babs feel so special. Y'know, after all the heartache she's been havin' in Manehattan."
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,Heartache?
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,applejack,"Well, I didn't say nothin' 'cause I didn't want her to feel singled out, but there's been some bullies back in Manehattan just been teasin' her to pieces for her blank flank."
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,T-t-t-teased?
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,B-Bullies?!
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,applejack,Yup. She came up to the farm to get away from all her problems back home. I'm so proud of y'all. You've done a good deed.
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,scootaloo,So that's why she jumped in when Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon started giving us a hard time.
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,"She didn't want to be bullied like at home, so she decided to be a bully instead!"
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,And now we've turned into bullies too!
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,cutie mark crusaders,What do we do?!
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,diamond tiara,"Nice float, Babs."
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,babs seed,Snagged it from those whiny baby blank flanks.
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,diamond tiara,"Too cool for mule, Babs."
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,We gotta stop that float!
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,"[almost inaudible] Applejack, quick you have to<U+0096>"
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,applejack,Huh?
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,"[almost inaudible] Quick, you have to help us<U+0096>"
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,applejack,What?
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,We booby-trapped it!
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,scootaloo,Babs! Bully! Payback! No time to explain! We've just gotta get Babs out of that float!
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,Sorry!
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,scootaloo,"'Scuse me! Ah, whoops."
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,Whoa!
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,scootaloo,"Pinkie Pie, let us in! (""lettuce in"")"
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,pinkie pie,[laughs] Funny joke!
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,"No, really! Let- us- in!"
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,pinkie pie,Ohhh! Here!
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,Babs! You gotta get out of that float!
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,babs seed,"You're not getting your float back, crybabies!"
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,But it's booby tra<U+0096>
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,pinkie pie,Veggie salad!
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,Huh?
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,pinkie pie,Veggie salad!
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,Seriously?
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,babs seed,What the<U+0096>
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,Babs! Babs!
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,babs seed,Oof!
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,"[yelling] Oooh, sweet applesauce!"
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,Maybe we'll get our cutie marks in stupidest ideas of all time.
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,applejack,Are y'all okay?
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,Yeah... we're fine.
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,scootaloo,No sweat.
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,babs seed,After I'd been so mean to ya... you saved me!
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,[sighs] About that...
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,babs seed,I don't get it! I saw it all happen! You pushed me out just when the float was about to head into the lake!
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,scootaloo,Except... we were the reason it was headed into the lake.
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,We booby trapped the float.
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,"Y'see Babs, we were tryin' to get you back for bein' a big bully..."
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,scootaloo,But then Applejack told us about how you were being bullied back in Manehattan.
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,"And we figured out you were just doing it to avoid getting picked on in Ponyville. But, by then... we were the ones being bullies. And... Oh, why does life have to be so ironic?!"
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,Guess what we're trying to say is...
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,cutie mark crusaders,We're sorry.
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,babs seed,[blows] I'm sorry too.
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,applejack,"[sighs] Y'know, this all could've been avoided if y'all just came to me in the very beginning."
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,That's what I kept on saying!
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,babs seed,So... can we... start over?
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,Definitely.
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,scootaloo,Yeah.
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,"""We, the Cutie Mark Crusaders, elect Babs Seed to join us as a sister, friend, confidaynte, alley, boss-om buddy, gal pal, compader, chum of chums..."""
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,Well you wrote this.
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,scootaloo,"Oh, uh, yeah..."
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,"""Homegirl... Amiga..."" Blah blah blah blah blah. Oh, yes, here. ""...and fellow Cutie Mark Crusader! You are solemnly sworn in, here this day, in witness of your fellow sisters, friends, confidantes... boss-om buddies... compadres..."""
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,scootaloo,"Congratulations! [quickly, under her breath] Gotta remember to revise that."
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,"So you promise you're gonna start our Manehattan branch of the Cutie Mark Crusaders, right?"
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,babs seed,"Yeah, and I promise to keep talking to my big sis about the teasing back home."
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,applejack,"Good. And if you have any problems, we've got your back too, y'hear?"
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,diamond tiara,So you're leaving huh? Great! Now we're stuck here with these lame blank flanks.
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,babs seed,Hey! That's not how you talk to my friends!
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,silver spoon,F-friends?
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,babs seed,"Yeah, you got a problem with that?"
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,diamond tiara,"Well, what if I do? What are you gonna do about it?"
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,babs seed,Tell your mothers about your bad attitudes!
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,I'm sure gonna miss that bad seed.
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,applejack,Bad seed? I thought y'all were friends now?
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,sweetie belle,"No, see, first we called her 'bad seed' as in actually a bad seed, but now she's bad as in good. Get it?"
One Bad Apple,Cindy Morrow,applejack,Yea... No.
Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,"Don't be scared, little friends. Twilight is wonderful with magic. [to Twilight] Anything happens to them, Twilight, so help me..."
Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,spike,"Aww, don't worry, Fluttershy, Twilight's magic has gotten a lot better since she accidentally crushed me and Applejack with a giant snowball."
Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,"Of course she's good with magic. Twilight's great with magic. I guess I just don't want my little friends to be scared. Oh, oh, look how scared they are!"
Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"I promise, Fluttershy. Nothing bad will happen to them."
Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,"[high-pitched] I know! Stop, stop! They can't take it!"
Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,spike,"Twilight, that looks amazing!"
Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,Phew!
Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"That's all for now, little ones. Maybe we can practice again later, if Fluttershy says it's alright."
Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,spike,"Your magic has really improved since we came to Ponyville, Twilight. Princess Celestia's going to love it."
Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Thanks, Spike. I have to be at my best when she arrives with the delegates from Saddle Arabia. I can't believe she's trusting me with the entertainment."
Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,Twilight! Come quick! It's an emergency!
Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,rarity,[gasp] You beast! This shade of brown should only be used for accents!
Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,"Come on, Applejack. We've got to get her in a nice, soothing pink, stat!"
Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,What's going on here?
Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,trixie,"Well, well, well. If it isn't... Twilight Sparkle."
Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,[gasps] Trixie!
Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,spike,What's she doing here?
Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,You call that great and powerful?
Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,snips,"Oh! She's Rainbow Wobble, now!"
Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,snails,Yeah! Ha ha ha ha!
Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,snails,"Good spell, oh Great and Powerful Trixie!"
Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,trixie,You two! Quiet!
Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,snips,"Uh, hey! W<U+0097> What happened?"
Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,snails,Get off of me! Brbrbr.
Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,snips,Let go!
Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,snails,Go this way!
Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Stop picking on my friends, Trixie!"
Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,trixie,"You and I have some unfinished business. My magic's gotten better since I was here last. And I'm going to prove it! Me and you, a magic duel. Winner stays, loser leaves Ponyville forever!"
Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,Forget it! I'd never make a deal like that!
Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,trixie,Hm. Your choice.
Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Trixie, put him down. Why are you doing this?"
Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,trixie,"Why? Because you humiliated me! After you showed me up with that Ursa Minor, I became a laughing stock! Everywhere I went I was laughed at and ostracized. I even had to take a job on a rock farm just to earn a living! A rock farm!"
Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,Hey! You're lucky a rock farm would take the likes of you!
Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,trixie,Now I want revenge! And I'll just keep casting spells 'til you agree. Well? What do you say?
Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,spike,Whoooaah! Help... me!
Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Alright, Trixie. Let's duel!"
Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,trixie,Excellent.
Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,trixie,"If I lose, I won't set hoof in Ponyville again. But if you lose, you're the one banished from this one-horse town!"
Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,trixie,Draw!
Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,trixie,"Snips, Snails, step forward!"
Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,An age spell? But... how could you do an age spell? That's only for the highest level unicorns!
Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,trixie,"Well, Twilight? Give up?"
Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,spike,"Come on, Twilight, you can do it!"
Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,trixie,Trixie is the highest level unicorn! [laughs] And now it's time for you to leave Ponyville! FOREVER!
Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,applejack,"That's enough, Trixie!"
Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,rarity,"You proved your point, but you can't possibly expect Twilight to leave Ponyville!"
Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,trixie,You fools! She's already gone!
Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"It's okay, guys. I'll figure something out. Just take care of each other. And keep an eye on Trixie. There's something strange about her."
Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"[grunts of exertion] Ugh! It's impossible! How could Trixie know such advanced magic? Without Spike, I can't get a message to the Princess in Saddle Arabia. So who else do I know who understands strange and powerful magic?"
Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,zecora,Your tale of woe upsets me so. [sips] No wonder you're dour. It's an abuse of power!
Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"I don't know what to do, Zecora. I feel like I've abandoned my friends. But I can't take her on horn-to-horn."
Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,zecora,"[sips] If you train with me, so good you'll be. I'll show you the way to make sure she won't stay."
Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"You'll train me in magic? But she was doing age spells, weather spells, you name it!"
Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,zecora,"When it comes to magic, it would be tragic if somepony licked me, especially Trixie."
Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,You really think I can beat her?
Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,zecora,Mm-hmm.
Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Okay, when do we start?"
Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,trixie,You two! Hurry up with my throne.
Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,trixie,"And you, how long do I have to wait for my applesauce facial?"
Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,applejack,"Forget it, Trixie! I ain't doing nothin' 'til you let Twilight come home! [laughs uncontrollably] Okay, I'll do it! Just make it stop! Hoo!"
Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,trixie,I thought I told you to dance!
Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,rarity,"Oh, Trixie's cruel magic is ruining Ponyville. Ow! [whines] Oh, somepony has to help us!"
Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,zecora,"Ah, no noise, no sound, no din, no fuss must interfere with your focus. Unlearn what you have learned. Only then can victory be earned."
Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,zecora,"There is much, much that I can teach, but the answer you need may still be out of reach."
Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"I'm sorry, Zecora. I'm trying my best, but... I can't stop thinking about Trixie. There was something different about her. It's like she's gone from high and mighty to mean and nasty."
Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,zecora,Your thinking needs a readjust. Total concentration is a must.
Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,rarity,"Ugh, this really doesn't seem to be getting us anywhere."
Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,applejack,"I hear you, Pinkie. I can't find anything that describes the kind of magic Trixie's doin'."
Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,spike,"Ugh, there must be something! Twilight has every magic book there is!"
Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,"[quietly] Um, I think I may have found something?"
Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,rarity,"Yes, it's time for us to consider our futures in this new Trixie-led Ponyville."
Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,"[quietly] Um, this sounds an awful lot like Trixie's magic<U+0096>"
Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,applejack,She wants me to grow apples with no peels! Now how the hay am I supposed to do that?
Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,"[quietly] Um, there's a picture here of that necklace<U+0096>"
Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,"[quietly] It's called the Alicorn Amulet, and whoever wears it is blessed with untold<U+0097>"
Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,spike,"Hey, everypony, look! This book has a picture of Trixie's necklace! It's called the Alicorn Amulet, and whoever wears it is blessed with untold powers!"
Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,"[quietly] If you read a little further, you'll see<U+0097>"
Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,rarity,"[reading] Even though it provides great power, it also corrupts the user!"
Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,"[quietly] Yes, but, um, you can't<U+0097>"
Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,spike,"[reading] You can't just take the Alicorn Amulet off her neck, it has a magical lock! Trixie's the only pony who can take it off!"
Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,[quietly] Maybe we could<U+0097>
Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,applejack,We need to get this information to Twilight. She'll know what to do.
Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,"[quietly] But, h<U+0097> how<U+0097>"
Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,rarity,"If any of us try to leave, Trixie's magical force field will tell her!"
Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,[quietly] Maybe we should<U+0097>
Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,"I've got it! Trying to sneak past the force field would be impossible without help, but I know who's got the goods to get into those woods!"
Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,[quietly] It<U+0097> it must be<U+0097>
Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,Fluttershy!
Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,Whaaat?!
Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,applejack,"What do you say, Fluttershy? Can you handle the mission?"
Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,No! I'll crack under the pressure! I'll snap like a twig!
Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,Perfect! Fluttershy'll sneak out of Ponyville and find Twilight.
Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,"But<U+0097> but I, I<U+0097>"
Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,[teeth chattering] [sighs] Okay.
Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,applejack,Alright!
Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,rarity,I know just the design for a dangerous mission outfit!
Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,trixie,"Pull, you fools! [cracks whip] Somepony set off the magic force field, and Trixie intends to punish them!"
Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,snips,[gasping] But... wouldn't it be faster if we had some... wheels?!
Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,trixie,The Great and Powerful Trixie doesn't trust wheels. Now pull faster!
Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,snails,"[gasping] I'm telling ya, Snips, she's getting weirder and weirder!"
Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,trixie,Stop! You there! What are you doing?!
Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,snails,"Gah, why is she so mean to us?"
Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,snips,Yeah! I miss the days when she was just a fraud!
Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,"Oh, okay, okay, you're right. I need to be brave and find Twilight."
Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,Oh! Y<U+0097> you found her?
Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,She's in the Everfree Forest?!
Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,"Oh, this is me being brave! I wanna be brave at home, locked in my closet, with my teddy bear!"
Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,I can't believe I didn't recognize the Alicorn Amulet!
Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,"The more she uses it, the more it will corrupt her!"
Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,But how am I supposed to beat that amulet? My magic's not good enough!
Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,zecora,"Twilight Sparkle, much work have you done. You learned all of my lessons; all but one. If Trixie's tricks have you in a fix, you must nix your magic and use the six."
Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Nix your magic, use the six... Nix your magic, use the six! Use the six! That's it! Zecora, you're a genius! Now we'll need to get you back inside Ponyville, Fluttershy."
Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,trixie,"This better not be another false alarm, or the Great and Powerful Trixie will<U+0096> [gasps] You! [muffled] What's the matter, Twilight Sparkle? Not enjoying your exile?"
Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,I know about the Alicorn Amulet. I know you cheated.
Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,trixie,Cheated? Moi?
Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Yeah. And I thought you might wanna see what a real magical amulet looks like. Zecora gave it to me. [muffled] It's from beyond the Everfree Forest, [normal] and it's way more powerful than your measly little Alicorn Amulet!"
Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,trixie,Ha! Nothing's more powerful than the Alicorn Amulet! And nopony's more powerful than the Great and Powerful Trixie!
Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,[muffled] Care to put your amulet where your mouth is? [normal] How about another duel?
Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,trixie,[muffled] Why should I? I already beat you.
Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"That's up to you! But I guess you'll never see the totally awesome magic from beyond the Everfree Forest. Come on, Zecora."
Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,trixie,Wait!
Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,trixie,"Okay, okay, you're on! A second duel."
Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,trixie,"Let's start with a simple age spell, shall we?"
Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,Let's.
Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,trixie,"Snips, Snails."
Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,trixie,"An oldie, but a goodie, ha. Now, let's see what your little charm can do."
Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"No problem. Um, Applejack, Rarity? Could you help me, please?"
Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,applejack,Huh?
Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,rarity,Huh?
Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,trixie,"Oh, ho-hum. So you can do an age spell, big deal."
Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,trixie,That's... That's impossible!
Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,That's nothing!
Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,Yow!
Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,trixie,How did you<U+0096>
Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,Duplication spell. Ever see one pony play ten instruments?
Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,trixie,This... just can't be!
Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Ooh, one more. I can turn a mare into a stallion."
Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Well, Trixie, looks like my amulet is more powerful than yours<U+0096> Hey! Give it back!"
Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,trixie,"[laughs] With this amulet, I shall now rule all of Equestria!"
Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,trixie,"Witness, my subjects. Gaze upon an ever greater and 'powerful-er' Trixie!"
Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,trixie,Hey! [scoffs] I don't need that old Alicorn Amulet. I have this!
Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,[laughs] Stop it! Tha<U+0097> that tickles!
Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,trixie,Tickles?! That was supposed to make you writhe in agony! This amulet is defective! [magic zap] Give mine back!
Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,Sorry. This is going back into hiding where it belongs.
Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"By the way, Trixie, the amulet around your neck? It's one of Zecora's doorstops."
Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,trixie,[upset] But... how did you do those spells? Nopony can do those spells!
Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"You're right. Not even me. Zecora taught me so much about magic while I was in exile. She even taught me when not to use it. My magic alone wasn't powerful enough to take on the Alicorn Amulet head to head, so I needed to use a different kind of magic <U+0096> the magic of friendship. I also knew that the only pony who could get the amulet off your neck was you."
Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,trixie,But... what about the pony with the ten instruments?
Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,That's not magic. That was just Pinkie Pie.
Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,Trixie?
Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,trixie,"It's the least I could do. I treated you and your friends so horribly when I was wearing that Alicorn Amulet. I just couldn't control myself. You can forgive me, can't you?"
Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,Hmmm. Sure.
Magic Duel,M. A. Larson,trixie,"Oh, good. Don't you think the Great and Apologetic Trixie is the most magnificent humble pony you've ever seen?!"
Sleepless in Ponyville,Corey Powell,scootaloo,Whoo-hoo!
Sleepless in Ponyville,Corey Powell,rainbow dash,"[sips] Nice moves, kid."
Sleepless in Ponyville,Corey Powell,scootaloo,Nice moves? Rainbow Dash thinks I've got<U+0096>
Sleepless in Ponyville,Corey Powell,scootaloo,[gasps] ...nice moves!
Sleepless in Ponyville,Corey Powell,scootaloo,"...Then, all of a sudden, I'm airborne! And Rainbow Dash looks over and was like, ""Nice moves, kid."""
Sleepless in Ponyville,Corey Powell,apple bloom,Woooow.
Sleepless in Ponyville,Corey Powell,sweetie belle,She really said that?
Sleepless in Ponyville,Corey Powell,scootaloo,"I mean, it's like she practically told me she wanted to take me under her wing, teach me everything she knows, and become like my big sister!"
Sleepless in Ponyville,Corey Powell,apple bloom,I dunno about all that.
Sleepless in Ponyville,Corey Powell,sweetie belle,"It was a really nice compliment and all, but..."
Sleepless in Ponyville,Corey Powell,scootaloo,"I know, I know. But all that stuff I said could happen, right?"
Sleepless in Ponyville,Corey Powell,apple bloom,Sure.
Sleepless in Ponyville,Corey Powell,sweetie belle,Absolutely.
Sleepless in Ponyville,Corey Powell,scootaloo,"I just need to find a way to spend some time with her, y'know, so she can see more of my awesomeness."
Sleepless in Ponyville,Corey Powell,apple bloom,"Well... Applejack and I are supposed to be campin' up at Winsome Falls this weekend. Maybe I could get my big sis to invite Rainbow Dash, and then you could come, too!"
Sleepless in Ponyville,Corey Powell,scootaloo,Really?!
Sleepless in Ponyville,Corey Powell,apple bloom,Sure!
Sleepless in Ponyville,Corey Powell,sweetie belle,I wanna go...
Sleepless in Ponyville,Corey Powell,apple bloom,"Well, duh, of course you can go!"
Sleepless in Ponyville,Corey Powell,sweetie belle,And I'll get Rarity to come too! Rarity loves camping!
Sleepless in Ponyville,Corey Powell,rarity,I despise camping! All of that... [shudders] ...nature.
Sleepless in Ponyville,Corey Powell,rarity,"Oh, all right! Ooh! Of course I will need to find an outfit more appropriate for 'roughing it'. Ooh!"
Sleepless in Ponyville,Corey Powell,sweetie belle,See? Told you she'd wanna go.
Sleepless in Ponyville,Corey Powell,applejack,You packed bug spray?
Sleepless in Ponyville,Corey Powell,apple bloom,Yup. You got the canteens?
Sleepless in Ponyville,Corey Powell,applejack,Yup. Looks like we're all set then.
Sleepless in Ponyville,Corey Powell,rarity,Hey!
Sleepless in Ponyville,Corey Powell,applejack,"Gee, Rarity, did you remember to pack?"
Sleepless in Ponyville,Corey Powell,rarity,"Oh, well, let's see who gets the last laugh when you're absolutely desperate to curl your lashes, and you realize you didn't bring your eyelash curler."
Sleepless in Ponyville,Corey Powell,applejack,"Well, looks like we're all set now."
Sleepless in Ponyville,Corey Powell,scootaloo,But what about Rainbow Dash? Isn't Rainbow Dash coming?
Sleepless in Ponyville,Corey Powell,applejack,"'Course she is, sugarcube. She's gonna meet us up at our first campsite."
Sleepless in Ponyville,Corey Powell,scootaloo,Oh.
Sleepless in Ponyville,Corey Powell,applejack,"Alright, y'all, let's move 'em out!"
Sleepless in Ponyville,Corey Powell,rarity,"Oh, are we there yet?"
Sleepless in Ponyville,Corey Powell,applejack,"The last thousand times you asked that, the answer was no. This time, it's actually yes. There's Rainbow Dash up there right now."
Sleepless in Ponyville,Corey Powell,scootaloo,"[quietly] Alright, Scootaloo, just play it cool. [normal] Hey Rai<U+0096>"
Sleepless in Ponyville,Corey Powell,scootaloo,"[clears throat] Hey, Rainbow Dash! What's up?"
Sleepless in Ponyville,Corey Powell,rainbow dash,What took you guys so long?
Sleepless in Ponyville,Corey Powell,applejack,"Well, some of us didn't pack as light as the others. So we were slowed down a bit."
Sleepless in Ponyville,Corey Powell,rainbow dash,"Looks like you'll be sharing a tent with me, huh?"
Sleepless in Ponyville,Corey Powell,scootaloo,"Heh, if that's okay with you."
Sleepless in Ponyville,Corey Powell,rainbow dash,"Sure! Long as you don't snore. You don't snore, do you?"
Sleepless in Ponyville,Corey Powell,scootaloo,Nope. No way. Not me. Never snored a day or [laughs nervously] night in my life.
Sleepless in Ponyville,Corey Powell,rainbow dash,Then you and I are gonna get along just fine.
Sleepless in Ponyville,Corey Powell,rainbow dash,You have got to be kidding me.
Sleepless in Ponyville,Corey Powell,rarity,"Sweetie Belle, do be a dear and see if you can find some fresh flowers for my bedside vase."
Sleepless in Ponyville,Corey Powell,rainbow dash,"[mimicking Rarity] Scootaloo, do be a sweetheart and see if you can gather some firewood."
Sleepless in Ponyville,Corey Powell,rainbow dash,Seriously though. Can you get us some wood for the fire?
Sleepless in Ponyville,Corey Powell,scootaloo,Of course!
Sleepless in Ponyville,Corey Powell,rainbow dash,"Okay, everybody get comfortable, 'cause I'm about to tell you the best story you've ever heard."
Sleepless in Ponyville,Corey Powell,scootaloo,"Is it about the time when Rarity had wings, and then they got ruined, and then you saved her from plummeting to her doom?"
Sleepless in Ponyville,Corey Powell,rainbow dash,"Okay, maybe it's the second best story you've ever heard. But probably still the scariest. [spookily] You like scary stories, right?"
Sleepless in Ponyville,Corey Powell,scootaloo,[gasps] Mm-hmm.
Sleepless in Ponyville,Corey Powell,rainbow dash,"It all happened on a night just like this one, in a forest, just like this..."
Sleepless in Ponyville,Corey Powell,rainbow dash,"...And then, The Olden Pony asked, [mimicking aged voice] ""Who's got my rusty horseshoe?"""
Sleepless in Ponyville,Corey Powell,sweetie belle,Not me!
Sleepless in Ponyville,Corey Powell,rainbow dash,You do!
Sleepless in Ponyville,Corey Powell,scootaloo,"[clears throat] Something in my throat. I wasn't scared at all, heheh. Good story."
Sleepless in Ponyville,Corey Powell,rainbow dash,"Knew you wouldn't be scared. The way you jumped that cart the other day, you're like me <U+0096> fearless."
Sleepless in Ponyville,Corey Powell,rarity,[coddling] Don't worry. Rarity is here to keep you safe and sound. Ooh!
Sleepless in Ponyville,Corey Powell,applejack,[yawns] Think it's about time for me to hit the straw.
Sleepless in Ponyville,Corey Powell,applejack,"Don't you worry, little sis. There's no 'Olden Pony' in our tent."
Sleepless in Ponyville,Corey Powell,scootaloo,"[nervously] Haa, that sure was funny, wasn't it? Heheh. How they were all afraid of The Olden Pony? Heh, but not me, heh!"
Sleepless in Ponyville,Corey Powell,rainbow dash,"That's because you're tough, just like when I was your age!"
Sleepless in Ponyville,Corey Powell,rainbow dash,I'm hitting the sack. Come in whenever you feel like it.
Sleepless in Ponyville,Corey Powell,scootaloo,"[nervously] It's, it's nothing... Just my imagination..."
Sleepless in Ponyville,Corey Powell,scootaloo,[nervously] And that isn't the thundering stomp of The Olden Pony...
Sleepless in Ponyville,Corey Powell,scootaloo,I-Is anyone out there?
Sleepless in Ponyville,Corey Powell,scootaloo,[cries] [dash] [panting] Rainbow Dash<U+0096>?
Sleepless in Ponyville,Corey Powell,rainbow dash,"[yawns] What's that noise? Is there a bug in here? [sighs] I dunno about you, but I slept like a filly."
Sleepless in Ponyville,Corey Powell,scootaloo,[nervously] Best night ever.
Sleepless in Ponyville,Corey Powell,rainbow dash,"Glad you're rested up, because we've got a long trek ahead. Totally gonna be worth it when we get to Winsome Falls."
Sleepless in Ponyville,Corey Powell,rarity,"Ohh... Am I sweating? Oh! I think I'm sweating! Oh, uh, but it's absolutely worth it to get to spend time with my little sister. It's just that this cart feels like it's getting heavier all the time!"
Sleepless in Ponyville,Corey Powell,applejack,"I don't care if that's cart's as heavy as a pack of mules. If we don't get a move on, it'll be dark before we get to the campsite!"
Sleepless in Ponyville,Corey Powell,scootaloo,"[gasps] Dark?! [wings buzzing] I'll just ride ahead and make sure the path is clear. We don't wanna be out here after dark, right?"
Sleepless in Ponyville,Corey Powell,rainbow dash,Doesn't matter to me.
Sleepless in Ponyville,Corey Powell,scootaloo,"Well, y'know, [hushed] it's for the scaredy-ponies, heheh."
Sleepless in Ponyville,Corey Powell,rarity,[fades in] That's why it's always important to bring your own trunk on any public outing.
Sleepless in Ponyville,Corey Powell,scootaloo,"[gasps] Um... don't come this way! Take the path! It's, heh, way better than going through the bushes."
Sleepless in Ponyville,Corey Powell,applejack,"You're more nervous than a worm in an apple on cider making day. What gives, Scootaloo?"
Sleepless in Ponyville,Corey Powell,scootaloo,"Heh, nothing, just thought I heard something, aheh."
Sleepless in Ponyville,Corey Powell,applejack,You sure you're okay? You seem a little jumpy.
Sleepless in Ponyville,Corey Powell,scootaloo,"Just getting my exercise! You know how important it is to stretch out those hindquarters every so often, aheh."
Sleepless in Ponyville,Corey Powell,scootaloo,"Uh, d-do you need a little help?"
Sleepless in Ponyville,Corey Powell,rarity,"That's so sweet, thank you."
Sleepless in Ponyville,Corey Powell,applejack,"No need for tents tonight, y'all. We'll just take shelter in that cave."
Sleepless in Ponyville,Corey Powell,rainbow dash,"All right! A deep, dark cave! Perfect for the story I've got for tonight. All we need is a campfire, and we're good to go."
Sleepless in Ponyville,Corey Powell,scootaloo,"[gulps] [nervously] Uh, of course..."
Sleepless in Ponyville,Corey Powell,scootaloo,[nervously] I'll be right back with lots of firewood from the deep... dark... not-scary-at-all forest!
Sleepless in Ponyville,Corey Powell,rainbow dash,Thanks.
Sleepless in Ponyville,Corey Powell,scootaloo,"[breathing heavily] [sighs] Okay. I can do this. On the count of three, I get those branches. One... two... three! [trembling] [sighs] [nervously] Here, branches branches branches..."
Sleepless in Ponyville,Corey Powell,applejack,Bbbbrrr! Hoo-wee! It's colder than a timberwolf's toenail. Bbbrr! Where's that Scootaloo?
Sleepless in Ponyville,Corey Powell,scootaloo,[panicked laughing] Here you go!
Sleepless in Ponyville,Corey Powell,rainbow dash,That's it?
Sleepless in Ponyville,Corey Powell,scootaloo,"It's all I could find, 'cause, y'know, there aren't that many trees around here!"
Sleepless in Ponyville,Corey Powell,applejack,It's all we need. Why don't you sit with Rainbow Dash for a while?
Sleepless in Ponyville,Corey Powell,scootaloo,"Hey, I have an idea! How about I tell tonight's story?"
Sleepless in Ponyville,Corey Powell,rainbow dash,"Alright, just make sure it's a horrible one."
Sleepless in Ponyville,Corey Powell,scootaloo,"There once was a really really nice pony who lived in a bright and sunny land, where there are rainbows every day, and lots and lots of happy friends, and<U+0096>"
Sleepless in Ponyville,Corey Powell,rainbow dash,"No offense, but it's not a real campfire story unless somepony's shaking. [spookily] I've been told that these very woods are haunted..."
Sleepless in Ponyville,Corey Powell,rainbow dash,[spookily] ...by The Headless Horse! It gallops only at night<U+0096>
Sleepless in Ponyville,Corey Powell,applejack,"If it doesn't have a head, then how in tarnation does this pony know where it's goin'?"
Sleepless in Ponyville,Corey Powell,rainbow dash,"It's headless, not brainless. [spookily] ...looking for little lost ponies<U+0096>"
Sleepless in Ponyville,Corey Powell,applejack,So where's its brain?
Sleepless in Ponyville,Corey Powell,rainbow dash,[spookily] [crossfades in] ...and they were never heard from ever again!
Sleepless in Ponyville,Corey Powell,sweetie belle,[gasps] Never?
Sleepless in Ponyville,Corey Powell,rainbow dash,Never.
Sleepless in Ponyville,Corey Powell,rarity,"Don't worry, you'll be safe with me tonight."
Sleepless in Ponyville,Corey Powell,scootaloo,"It's not time for bed yet, is it?"
Sleepless in Ponyville,Corey Powell,applejack,"'Fraid so, Scootaloo."
Sleepless in Ponyville,Corey Powell,sweetie belle,You don't have to ask me twice!
Sleepless in Ponyville,Corey Powell,rarity,"Good night, Sweetie Belle."
Sleepless in Ponyville,Corey Powell,applejack,"Good night, y'all."
Sleepless in Ponyville,Corey Powell,apple bloom,"Good night, y'all."
Sleepless in Ponyville,Corey Powell,rainbow dash,Sleep tight.
Sleepless in Ponyville,Corey Powell,scootaloo,"Oh, just one more song! Anyone? [whoosh] How about a dance contest? I know you love to cut a rug, so how 'bout we mess up a cave floor? I have a brilliant idea! Hide and seek! Who's with me?"
Sleepless in Ponyville,Corey Powell,apple bloom,[yawns] Maybe tomorrow.
Sleepless in Ponyville,Corey Powell,scootaloo,Aww.
Sleepless in Ponyville,Corey Powell,applejack,Seems like you don't really wanna go to sleep tonight. Is there some reason why?
Sleepless in Ponyville,Corey Powell,scootaloo,"Pfft, of course not! I just love camping and hanging out with Rainbow Dash so much that I don't wanna waste a single minute with sleep! [yawns] Heh, silly sleep."
Sleepless in Ponyville,Corey Powell,rainbow dash,"That's cool and all, Scoot, but this pony needs her shut-eye and she needs it now!"
Sleepless in Ponyville,Corey Powell,scootaloo,"[gasps] If The Headless Horse catches me, I'm never gonna be heard from again! And I wanna be heard from! Woah, woaaah! Ugh! [grunts] Woah!"
Sleepless in Ponyville,Corey Powell,scootaloo,[panting] Aaah!
Sleepless in Ponyville,Corey Powell,princess luna,"[echoing] A warm welcome to you, Scootaloo."
Sleepless in Ponyville,Corey Powell,scootaloo,Princess Luna! I thought you were The Headless Horse!
Sleepless in Ponyville,Corey Powell,princess luna,"You were mistaken, but I hope not disappointed."
Sleepless in Ponyville,Corey Powell,scootaloo,"You are so, so much better than The Headless Horse. But what are you doing here? Shouldn't you be in Canterlot?"
Sleepless in Ponyville,Corey Powell,princess luna,I am the princess of the night. Thus it is my duty to come into your dreams.
Sleepless in Ponyville,Corey Powell,scootaloo,"Oh, yeah... Wait, is this just a dream? But it feels so real!"
Sleepless in Ponyville,Corey Powell,princess luna,"I assure you that you are asleep. But when you awake, the thing that frightens you most will still exist."
Sleepless in Ponyville,Corey Powell,scootaloo,[nervously] Eh... The Headless Horse?
Sleepless in Ponyville,Corey Powell,princess luna,Hmmm... Is The Headless Horse really what frightens you the most?
Sleepless in Ponyville,Corey Powell,scootaloo,Mm-mm. I'm afraid Rainbow Dash will find out I'm not as tough as she thinks I am.
Sleepless in Ponyville,Corey Powell,princess luna,"Everypony has fears, Scootaloo. Everypony must face them in their own way. But they must be faced, or the nightmares will continue."
Sleepless in Ponyville,Corey Powell,princess luna,Face your fears!
Sleepless in Ponyville,Corey Powell,scootaloo,<U+0096>Princess Luna?! [sighs] It was just a dream.
Sleepless in Ponyville,Corey Powell,scootaloo,"[gasps] But The Headless Horse isn't! Rainbow Dash said it lives here, in these very woods!"
Sleepless in Ponyville,Corey Powell,scootaloo,"[panting] So it's a horse without a head... which means it doesn't have a mouth... and if it doesn't have a mouth, then... it's not a horse-eat-pony kind of horse... but still... it's a horse without a head!"
Sleepless in Ponyville,Corey Powell,scootaloo,Hello?! Is anyone out there? [nervously] Anyone except The Headless Horse?
Sleepless in Ponyville,Corey Powell,scootaloo,Heellllp<U+0096>
Sleepless in Ponyville,Corey Powell,rainbow dash,I gotcha!
Sleepless in Ponyville,Corey Powell,scootaloo,"Rainbow Dash! Is that you? Thank you, thank you!"
Sleepless in Ponyville,Corey Powell,rainbow dash,What were you doing out here in the middle of the night?!
Sleepless in Ponyville,Corey Powell,princess luna,"[echoing] It is time for you to face your real fear, Scootaloo!"
Sleepless in Ponyville,Corey Powell,rainbow dash,"Hey, I'm gonna tell you something, but if you ever tell anypony else, I'm gonna deny it. First time I heard those stories... I was scared too."
Sleepless in Ponyville,Corey Powell,scootaloo,[sniffles] You were?
Sleepless in Ponyville,Corey Powell,rainbow dash,"Sure! I mean, I got over it because I realized pretty quick that if there was such thing as a Headless Horse, I could totally take it on. So, you're looking for somepony to take you under their wing, huh?"
Sleepless in Ponyville,Corey Powell,scootaloo,Mm-hmm.
Sleepless in Ponyville,Corey Powell,rainbow dash,"Yeah, I might be up for something like that."
Sleepless in Ponyville,Corey Powell,scootaloo,Really?
Sleepless in Ponyville,Corey Powell,rainbow dash,As long as you don't go falling into any more rivers in the middle of the night.
Sleepless in Ponyville,Corey Powell,scootaloo,[giggles] It's a deal!
Sleepless in Ponyville,Corey Powell,sweetie belle,I call sister teams! Last herd to make it to the falls is a moldy carrot!
Sleepless in Ponyville,Corey Powell,rarity,"Ugh, if you insist. [giggles] It is so on!"
Sleepless in Ponyville,Corey Powell,rainbow dash,They think they can beat the two of us?
Sleepless in Ponyville,Corey Powell,rainbow dash,"Here it is, for pony's sake. Now take it and stop all your moaning."
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,pinkie pie,"Ooooh, I wish the mailpony would just come already! I can't wait another minute to find out if Rainbow Dash got in or not!"
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,twilight sparkle,"Pinkie Pie, you're more nervous than Rainbow Dash."
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,I'm not nervous at all. When I get into the Wonderbolt Academy...
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,pinkie pie,IF you get in! If you get in! Don't jinx it!
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,"I'm telling you, it's in the bag."
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,pinkie pie,Don't jinx it!
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,applejack,She is the best flyer in Ponyville.
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,In Ponyville? I'm probably the best flyer in all of Equestria. I wouldn't be surprised if they just went ahead and made me a Wonderbolt on the first day.
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,I... didn't get in.
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,"Gotcha! Ha, you guys are so gullible. Like I wasn't gonna get in!"
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,pinkie pie,I'm just sooooooooooo happy for you!
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,Uh... thanks?
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,Pinkie Pie? I kinda need to get going.
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,pinkie pie,Okay. I'm done!
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,"The sooner I get there, the sooner I get to show 'em my stuff! See you guys in a week!"
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,applejack,Good luck!
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,Won't need it!
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,pinkie pie,DON'T FORGET TO WRITE!!! [echoing] [to others] Do you think she heard me?
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,"Oh, yeah! This is gonna be sweet!"
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,spitfire,"Well, lookie what we got here. Bet y'all think you're Wonderbolt material, don't ya?"
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,spitfire,Think you got what it takes to be an elite flyer?
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,spitfire,"Well then. Let me be the first to tell you... You don't! If you had what it took to be an elite flyer, you'd already be a Wonderbolt! Still think you're something special?"
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,spitfire,[to Bulk Biceps] Ya think you're hot stuff? [to Rainbow Dash] You look like you're the worst flyer in the whole academy! You'll probably quit after the first day!
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,"No, ma'am! I'd never quit, ma'am!"
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,spitfire,Ha. What about you? Bet you couldn't fly past the first flagpole without getting winded.
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,lightning dust,"Try me, ma'am."
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,spitfire,What's that?
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,lightning dust,"Let me show you what I've got, ma'am."
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,spitfire,"Ah. You want a chance to prove yourself, huh?"
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,lightning dust,"Yes, ma'am!"
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,spitfire,"Well then, now's your chance. Give me five hundred laps! All of you!"
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,spitfire,Lap four-hundred and ninety-nine!
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,One more lap to go!
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,lightning dust,You're on!
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,spitfire,Five hundred!
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,spitfire,Not bad... for a couple of newbies.
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,lightning dust,Name's Lightning Dust.
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,Rainbow Dash!
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,lightning dust,Wanna grab some grub in the mess hall?
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,Definitely.
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,applejack,"Pinkie Pie, Rainbow Dash hasn't even been gone twenty-four hours yet. Give her a chance to settle in first. Why don't we just go see what Twilight's up to? I hear Princess Celestia's got her workin' on some new spells!"
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,applejack,"So in other words, you're stickin' by the mailbox."
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,pinkie pie,Yep!
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,applejack,Suit yourself.
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,spitfire,"The Wonderbolts are the fastest, best precision flyers in the world. But spin-outs can still happen. And when they do, a Wonderbolt must be able to recover quickly. This... is the Dizzitron. It's gonna make you very <U+0096> I repeat <U+0096> very dizzy. Your task is to try and recover and fly straight again, as soon as possible. Once you have recovered you must come in for a smooth landing. Now, who's first? [to Meadow Flower] You. You're up."
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,spitfire,Now! Ready?
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,spitfire,Go!
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,spitfire,Release!
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,spitfire,"Huh. Fifteen seconds. Decent, but I wouldn't go writin' home about it! Who's next? Alright, Rainbow Dash. Let's see what you got."
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,"Yes, ma'am!"
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,spitfire,"Okay, go!"
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,spitfire,Release! Six seconds? That's an academy record.
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,I make everything look easy.
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,spitfire,"Okay, Lightning Dust. You're up."
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,lightning dust,"Ma'am, can you put the Dizzitron at maximum speed? I wanna push my limits."
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,spitfire,You sure about that?
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,lightning dust,Yes ma'am.
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,spitfire,Okay. You asked for it.
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,spitfire,Release! Six point five seconds. Not bad.
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,spitfire,Next!
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,No pony even came close to six seconds.
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,lightning dust,They should make us Wonderbolts right now.
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,"Yeah, they should."
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,spitfire,"Listen up! For the rest of the camp, you'll be working in pairs. 'Morrow morning, I'll post the teams, including who'll be lead pony and who'll be wingpony. Good luck."
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,lightning dust,Like we're going to need it.
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,"Heh, yeah."
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,"So, which one of you lucky gals gets to be my wingpony? What?"
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,A wingpony?
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,lightning dust,They made us a team! Isn't that awesome?
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,"Permission to enter, ma'am."
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,spitfire,"What is it, Rainbow Dash?"
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,I had the best time on the Dizzitron! Only six seconds!
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,spitfire,And?
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,And you made me a wingpony!
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,spitfire,Because I believe you and Lightning Dust will be an unstoppable team. Do you not think you'll be an unstoppable team?
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,"Yes, ma'am! I mean no, ma'am! I mean... We'll be an unstoppable team, ma'am."
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,spitfire,Then what's the problem?
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,"I think I should be lead pony, ma'am."
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,spitfire,And I think Lightning Dust likes to push herself a little harder than you do. That's why I made her lead pony. Got it?
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,"Yes, ma'am."
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,spitfire,Good.
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,spitfire,"Today you will all be participating in a flag hunt. We'll divide you into two teams, red... and blue. Whoever finds the most flags of the opposing team's color wins."
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,spitfire,"If you think this is gonna to be fun, you are sadly mistaken. This is for training purposes. This is not recess. Lead ponies and wingponies must fly together. If any pair splits apart, they will be immediately disqualified. Do you understand?"
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,lightning dust,Ready to rock and roll?
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,Ready.
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,lightning dust,You spotted any flags yet?
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,Not yet. Oh! There's one!
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,lightning dust,Good eyes!
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,We should slow down. It doesn't look like both of us can make it at this speed!
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,lightning dust,Peh.
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,Ow!
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,spitfire,Lightning Dust and Rainbow Dash found the first flag!
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,lightning dust,Come on! Let's find some more!
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,"Uh, sure. Just give me a second."
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,lightning dust,"Oh, you're fine."
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,rarity,She's still at it.
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,fluttershy,I just wish we could help her.
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,pinkie pie,"Help me? The only thing that could possibly help me right now is a letter from Rainbow Dash! It's been three days already. By now, she probably doesn't even know our names anymore! She probably can't remember our faces! ""Pinkie Pie? I never heard of a Pinkie Pie! Who is Pinkie Pie?"""
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,twilight sparkle,"Well, if you're so worried, then why don't you send her a letter first?"
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,pinkie pie,Of course! That's a great idea!
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,pinkie pie,"Oh wait! I got an even better idea! How about we send Rainbow Dash a care package? You know, before she forgets all about us? Although, come on, let's face it. It's probably too late for that. But, uh, maybe it'll jog her memory somehow."
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,twilight sparkle,"Pinkie Pie, I'm sure Rainbow Dash still remembers our faces and who we are. But I think sending her a care package is a great idea."
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,pinkie pie,A care package it is! We'll send it through the mail! WAIT! Ah! That won't work at all!
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,applejack,Why not?
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,pinkie pie,Because what if the package gets lost in the mail? What if somepony else gets the package by accident and then she remembers us instead of Rainbow Dash and then she becomes our new friend? And then the real Rainbow Dash won't ever know that she used to have friends and she forgot them!
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,applejack,Is anypony else followin' this?
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,pinkie pie,I've got it! We'll deliver the care package to Rainbow Dash in person!
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,rarity,I wouldn't mind a little trip.
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,twilight sparkle,I'll go!
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,applejack,Count me in!
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,fluttershy,Me too.
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,pinkie pie,Me five! But don't be upset if she doesn't recognize you at first. It may take a while for her to get her memory back.
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,spitfire,Today we'll be doing our famous air obstacle course.
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,lightning dust,"Ugh! Can't they go any faster? It's no good, I can't get around them!"
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,Doesn't matter! We can still fly completely in sync and blow Spitfire's mind with our moves!
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,lightning dust,I guess...
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,lightning dust,"What are they, a couple of snails? It's just a little weather."
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,lightning dust,Now's our chance to pass these slowpokes!
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,spitfire,"Not bad! And in record time, too! Definitely made the right decision making you two a team. The others seem to have had a little trouble with the precision part of the exercise. I'd better go help sort them out. Why don't you two go hit the mess hall early?"
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,lightning dust,"Yes, ma'am!"
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,"Thank you, ma'am. Um, Lightning Dust? Next time, maybe we don't cut the other teams off like that."
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,lightning dust,"Hey, you snooze, you lose! Besides, Wonderbolts are supposed to be able to recover from a spin-out. You saw them on the Dizzitron! They could use the practice. I mean, it's not our fault we're so much better than those other guys! Not every pony is destined to become a Wonderbolt. Only the best of the best, right?"
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,"Yeah, I-I guess you're right..."
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,lightning dust,'Course I'm right! Now let's go fuel up! Kicking all that tail has made me hungry.
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,bulk biceps,[chomp] Yeah!
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,lightning dust,I have an idea about how we can literally blow away our competition.
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,But we're already way ahead.
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,lightning dust,Are you in or not?
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,spitfire,[echoing] Lightning Dust likes to push herself a little harder than you do. That's why I made her lead pony.
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,I'm in!
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,lightning dust,Then follow my lead!
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,lightning dust,I can't control it!
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,applejack,It's a twister!
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,twilight sparkle,Hold on!
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,Noooooo!
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,Are you guys okay?
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,Pinkie Pie!
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,pinkie pie,You... remember me!
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,"Well... yeah, of course I remember you. But... what are you all doing here?"
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,applejack,We wanted to bring you a care package. Didn't realize you'd be in the middle of some crazy tornado drill.
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,lightning dust,That... was... awesome!
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,Awesome? My friends could have been smashed to pieces!
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,lightning dust,"Yeah, but they weren't, right? Can't say the same for the clouds. We totally wiped them out with that tornado. The other cadets will have to be up there for days to bust as many as we did."
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,A hoof bump? Seriously? You made me clip my wing. You sent half of our class into serious tailspins on the obstacle course. You unleashed a tornado that nearly demolished my friends!
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,lightning dust,"Yeah, and?"
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,And I get that you want to be the best. So do I! But you're going about it in the wrong way.
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,lightning dust,"The Wonderbolts don't seem to think so. After all, Spitfire did make me the leader and you the wingpony."
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,[sigh] You're right. She did.
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,spitfire,This better be important. You're supposed to be up there busting clouds with your partner.
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,"We're done with that, ma'am."
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,spitfire,Already? That's an academy record! Explain your methods.
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,"That's why I'm here, ma'am. Lightning Dust decided to use a tornado."
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,spitfire,"A bit excessive for cloud-busting. But judging from your time, it was obviously an effective tactic."
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,"Yeah, well that ""effective tactic"" nearly took out my friends! No disrespect, ma'am, but there's a big difference between pushing yourself as hard as you can and just being reckless. And if being reckless is what gets rewarded around here, if that's what it means to be a Wonderbolt, then I don't want any part of it."
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,spitfire,"What are you saying, newbie?"
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,I quit.
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,applejack,You did what?!
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,rarity,Being a Wonderbolt was your dream!
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,Not anymore.
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,twilight sparkle,"I'm sorry, Rainbow Dash. I know how much this meant to you."
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,spitfire,"Rainbow Dash! How dare you storm out of my office without giving me a chance to respond! The Wonderbolts are looking for the best flyers in Equestria, but you were right. Being the best should never come at the expense of our fellow ponies. It's not just about pushing ourselves. It's about pushing ourselves in the right direction. You've shown that you're capable of doing just that. You're no wingpony, Rainbow Dash. You're a leader."
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,OhmygoshOhmygoshOhmygoshOhmygoshOhmygosh!
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,spitfire,Now get out there and give me twenty!
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,"Yes, ma'am!"
Wonderbolts Academy,Merriwether Williams,pinkie pie,Wait! You didn't even get to open your care package!
Apple Family Reunion,Cindy Morrow,applejack,Ha! Found 'em!
Apple Family Reunion,Cindy Morrow,granny smith,Aaa-choooo!
Apple Family Reunion,Cindy Morrow,applejack,Heh. Gesundhoof.
Apple Family Reunion,Cindy Morrow,granny smith,"Why, thank you, Applejack. I still can't believe it's been almost one hundred moons since our last family reunion. Aw, I remember it like it was yesterday."
Apple Family Reunion,Cindy Morrow,applejack,"Well, you have been talkin' about it pretty much every day since then."
Apple Family Reunion,Cindy Morrow,granny smith,Apple Bloom! How them RSVPs comin' along? Who's showin' their muzzle at the reunion?
Apple Family Reunion,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,Everypony!
Apple Family Reunion,Cindy Morrow,granny smith,"Everypony? [aside, to Applejack] Feathers on a goat. [to Apple Bloom] Are you sure?"
Apple Family Reunion,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,"Well, I got RSVPs from Apples from Yonder Hill, Hollow Shades, Galloping Gorge, Foal Mountain, Apples from Fillydelphia, Tall Tale Town, and all the Apples from Appleloosa!"
Apple Family Reunion,Cindy Morrow,granny smith,Guh?
Apple Family Reunion,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,Oh! And how could I forget? Manehattan! Babs is comin'! I get to see my favorite cousin!
Apple Family Reunion,Cindy Morrow,granny smith,I think we're gonna need a bigger cider trough.
Apple Family Reunion,Cindy Morrow,granny smith,Whooeee! Looks like the family's grown tenfold since the last reunion! I'm gonna be busier than a worm in a rotten tomater tryin' to get everything ready!
Apple Family Reunion,Cindy Morrow,applejack,I could always help out.
Apple Family Reunion,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,"Me, too!"
Apple Family Reunion,Cindy Morrow,big mcintosh,Eeyup.
Apple Family Reunion,Cindy Morrow,granny smith,"Oh, I sure would appreciate that. Granny's a little rustier in the giddy-up since the last time the Apples all got together."
Apple Family Reunion,Cindy Morrow,applejack,"You may be a tad old, Granny, but you're as feisty and full of spark as ever<U+0096>"
Apple Family Reunion,Cindy Morrow,granny smith,Who you callin' old?!
Apple Family Reunion,Cindy Morrow,applejack,Uh... I just meant... Why don't you let me take over puttin' the reunion together this time 'round? Then all you need to worry about is enjoyin' yourself.
Apple Family Reunion,Cindy Morrow,granny smith,"Hmmm. Alright, young'un, you got yourself a deal. You are in charge."
Apple Family Reunion,Cindy Morrow,applejack,"I won't let you down, Granny. You just tell me what the reunion needs, and I'll take care of the rest."
Apple Family Reunion,Cindy Morrow,granny smith,I'll do better than tell you what the reunion'll need. I'll show ya!
Apple Family Reunion,Cindy Morrow,granny smith,We've been hostin' these things at Sweet Apple Acres every hundred moons since we first planted roots here in Ponyville.
Apple Family Reunion,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,"Hey, who's that?"
Apple Family Reunion,Cindy Morrow,granny smith,"That'd be your Great-Great-Auntie Applesauce when she was just about your age. Now, she used to go by another name, but everypony started calling her Applesauce after half her teeth fell out when she was makin' apple jam. Yeah. Never did find them teeth in all those jars."
Apple Family Reunion,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,"Hey! That's you, Granny!"
Apple Family Reunion,Cindy Morrow,granny smith,Sure is. Apple family's been workin' on that same old quilt since our first reunion.
Apple Family Reunion,Cindy Morrow,granny smith,"Well, nopony told me you actually had to knot the end of the thread!"
Apple Family Reunion,Cindy Morrow,applejack,"Okay, so I'll need to get new quiltin' materials, fabric, needles, thread... You've really been workin' on the same quilt since the first reunion?"
Apple Family Reunion,Cindy Morrow,granny smith,Surely have. I don't think we're ever gonna finish that doggone thing!
Apple Family Reunion,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,"Hey, what's goin' on here?"
Apple Family Reunion,Cindy Morrow,granny smith,"Well, you know us Apples enjoy a good fritter..."
Apple Family Reunion,Cindy Morrow,granny smith,That's how we figured out your sister had the appetite of a full-grown stallion.
Apple Family Reunion,Cindy Morrow,applejack,"Better get twice as much honey and flour, then... fifty more buckets of apples... more oil... wood for the fire..."
Apple Family Reunion,Cindy Morrow,granny smith,"Now, stick an apple in my mouth and roast my rump! This one sure brings back memories. Y'know how Babs is your favorite cousin? Well, Apple Rose is mine. The two of us entered the seven-legged race every reunion!"
Apple Family Reunion,Cindy Morrow,granny smith,Never won a single one of them races.
Apple Family Reunion,Cindy Morrow,applejack,"Races. We'll need cloth ties, finish line... Not much to a seven-legged race. Hmm..."
Apple Family Reunion,Cindy Morrow,granny smith,"And, of course, we can't forget to take the big family photo! We always snapped a photo in front of the barn at the end of every reunion, let's us see how our family's grown!"
Apple Family Reunion,Cindy Morrow,applejack,Photo in front of the barn. Got it.
Apple Family Reunion,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,"You sure have some great memories of these reunions, don'tcha?"
Apple Family Reunion,Cindy Morrow,granny smith,"Indeedy, and I'm lookin' forward to makin' more at this one. Oh, I'm sure everypony is, and I do mean everypony! We got the whole family together this time 'round! Who knows if they'll all be able to make the next one?"
Apple Family Reunion,Cindy Morrow,applejack,"That's true! Busy as everypony's lives are gettin' these days, chances are pretty slim we'll be this lucky next time 'round. Don't worry, Granny, I'm gonna make sure this is the most memorable reunion we've ever had! I'd better get started... I've got some plannin' to do!"
Apple Family Reunion,Cindy Morrow,granny smith,"Oh, hootenanny! Would you look what your second cousin is wearin' on her head?"
Apple Family Reunion,Cindy Morrow,applejack,Apple Bloom! What are you doin' up?
Apple Family Reunion,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,I was gonna ask you the same thing.
Apple Family Reunion,Cindy Morrow,applejack,I can't sleep. My gears are turnin' in my head about this reunion!
Apple Family Reunion,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,[yawning] Yeah... I can't wait to see my cousin Babs. We're gonna do so many fun things together...
Apple Family Reunion,Cindy Morrow,applejack,"Fun? That's just the beginnin' of it! Granny Smith handed me the reins of this reunion, and I'm gonna make the most of it. Apple Bloom, I've got so many things planned you won't even have a minute's rest!"
Apple Family Reunion,Cindy Morrow,applejack,"Trust me, little sis. This reunion I'm puttin' together is gonna be worth the wait."
Apple Family Reunion,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,[snoring] Whoa!
Apple Family Reunion,Cindy Morrow,applejack,Rise and shine! We don't have much time!
Apple Family Reunion,Cindy Morrow,pinkie pie,[belches] Don't forget the glitter!
Apple Family Reunion,Cindy Morrow,applejack,H-ah. Think that'll do it!
Apple Family Reunion,Cindy Morrow,granny smith,"And just in time, too."
Apple Family Reunion,Cindy Morrow,applejack,They're here!
Apple Family Reunion,Cindy Morrow,granny smith,"Apple Rose! Ohhh! Ooh, this is more excitin' than when it rained frogs!"
Apple Family Reunion,Cindy Morrow,applejack,"[through megaphone] Howdy, y'all, and welcome to the Apple family reunion!"
Apple Family Reunion,Cindy Morrow,applejack,"[through megaphone] My name's Applejack, and I just want to let y'all know that I got a real big day planned for ya! We're gonna start off with an obstacle course for the young'uns, and some fritter makin' and quiltin' for the not-so-young'uns. And there's lots more to come after that! Hope y'all enjoy it!"
Apple Family Reunion,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,Where is she?
Apple Family Reunion,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,Babs!
Apple Family Reunion,Cindy Morrow,babs seed,Cuz!
Apple Family Reunion,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,"I know it hasn't been that long since we've seen each other, but<U+0096>"
Apple Family Reunion,Cindy Morrow,babs seed,I can't wait to tell you about my new school!
Apple Family Reunion,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,I can't wait to hear all about it!
Apple Family Reunion,Cindy Morrow,babs seed,"Jeepers, where do I start? Okay. So first day<U+0096>"
Apple Family Reunion,Cindy Morrow,applejack,"Babs! Huh, so glad you could come!"
Apple Family Reunion,Cindy Morrow,applejack,Why don't you two head over to the obstacle course?
Apple Family Reunion,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,We kinda wanna catch up a little bit first...
Apple Family Reunion,Cindy Morrow,applejack,Don't you worry. There'll be plenty of time for family bondin' while you're racin' against your other cousins.
Apple Family Reunion,Cindy Morrow,applejack,"Alrighty, ponies! Ready to have some fun?"
Apple Family Reunion,Cindy Morrow,babs seed,"Whoa, is that the finish line? It's like a mile away or somethin'!"
Apple Family Reunion,Cindy Morrow,applejack,"Actually, that's just the marker where you go on to the next leg of the race."
Apple Family Reunion,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,There's more?
Apple Family Reunion,Cindy Morrow,applejack,"Much more. Trust me, I have put together somethin' you are never gonna forget. After the seven-legged race, you're gonna wanna hurry up and head over here, where you'll be bobbin' for apples!"
Apple Family Reunion,Cindy Morrow,applejack,"Then you'll run around these trees fifty times until you're real good and dizzy. Then you'll jump these big wooden hurdles. And then there's the final leg, where you'll balance plates on your head while sayin' ""Pappy pony picked a pluck of prickly pluffnuggets"" over and over and over again. Last pony standin' wins!"
Apple Family Reunion,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,Seriously?
Apple Family Reunion,Cindy Morrow,applejack,"Seriously! C'mon, y'all! Let's start makin' some memories! On your mark... get set... go!"
Apple Family Reunion,Cindy Morrow,applejack,"Whooeee! Lookin' good, everypony! Ooh, better go check on the quilt."
Apple Family Reunion,Cindy Morrow,granny smith,"How long you had those new choppers, Auntie Applesauce?"
Apple Family Reunion,Cindy Morrow,granny smith,[giggles] We were just usin' it to help break open that pi<f1>ata!
Apple Family Reunion,Cindy Morrow,applejack,"Sorry, Auntie Applesauce, I am busy-busy-busy. Y'all should get started, though!"
Apple Family Reunion,Cindy Morrow,granny smith,We couldn't find our rocking chairs.
Apple Family Reunion,Cindy Morrow,applejack,I got rid of 'em to make room for these. This is the year y'all are finally gonna finish that quilt!
Apple Family Reunion,Cindy Morrow,applejack,[over noise] Won't that be excitin'?
Apple Family Reunion,Cindy Morrow,applejack,"[over noise] I said, won't that be<U+0096>"
Apple Family Reunion,Cindy Morrow,applejack,<U+0096>excitin'?
Apple Family Reunion,Cindy Morrow,applejack,[over noise] That's the spirit!
Apple Family Reunion,Cindy Morrow,granny smith,[over noise] What did she say?
Apple Family Reunion,Cindy Morrow,granny smith,[over noise] Good gracious!
Apple Family Reunion,Cindy Morrow,babs seed,[dizzy] How are Scootaloo and Sweetie Belle?
Apple Family Reunion,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,[dizzy] Great! Ugh...
Apple Family Reunion,Cindy Morrow,babs seed,[dizzy] You alright?
Apple Family Reunion,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,Ugh...
Apple Family Reunion,Cindy Morrow,applejack,Havin' fun?
Apple Family Reunion,Cindy Morrow,applejack,"Better pick up the pace on those fritters though, huh? Roll, fold, crimp, slide to the left. Roll, fold, crimp, slide to the left. Roll, fold, crimp, slide to the left. Now you try! That's it! Gotta keep this assembly line movin', gals! We want every Apple here to get a chance to taste the best darn fritters in Equestria!"
Apple Family Reunion,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,Any other blank flanks at your new school?
Apple Family Reunion,Cindy Morrow,babs seed,Yeah. Two.
Apple Family Reunion,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,Do they wanna be Crusaders?
Apple Family Reunion,Cindy Morrow,babs seed,Totally!
Apple Family Reunion,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,Great!
Apple Family Reunion,Cindy Morrow,babs seed,Ah can' thfeel my tongue.
Apple Family Reunion,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,Neh nehber.
Apple Family Reunion,Cindy Morrow,applejack,"[through megaphone] Alright, Apples, break!"
Apple Family Reunion,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,[sighs] Finally...
Apple Family Reunion,Cindy Morrow,applejack,"Ooh, can't forget to capture all these memories for Granny's album! Huh. Nothin' all that memorable there. Or there. Or there. C'mon, Applejack, think. You gotta kick this thing up a notch! Hm..."
Apple Family Reunion,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,"I get that my big sis wants this to be like a super-awesome reunion, but that was ridiculous!"
Apple Family Reunion,Cindy Morrow,babs seed,I thought we'd never get a minute to just hang out!
Apple Family Reunion,Cindy Morrow,applejack,And your minute's up! Your fellow Apples are waitin' for you to join them.
Apple Family Reunion,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,"Applejack, I haven't had any time with Babs! We were so busy with that obstacle course, we didn't even get to talk!"
Apple Family Reunion,Cindy Morrow,applejack,There'll be plenty of time to bond with Babs when we do the hayride.
Apple Family Reunion,Cindy Morrow,babs seed,Hayride?
Apple Family Reunion,Cindy Morrow,applejack,"Alright, everypony! Step right up, take a seat, and leave the drivin' to these stallions! Now, I know y'all've been workin' real hard makin' some awesome memories. And in all of our past reunions, we always had a nice and relaxin' hayride around the farm. Which is why I decided to change things up a bit, and try somethin' just a wee bit more excitin'. So let's get this show on the road! Giddy-up!"
Apple Family Reunion,Cindy Morrow,granny smith,Where in the world does that girl have us headed? The west orchard?
Apple Family Reunion,Cindy Morrow,big mcintosh,Eeyup.
Apple Family Reunion,Cindy Morrow,babs seed,Wowza! Never seen real fruit bats before!
Apple Family Reunion,Cindy Morrow,applejack,Uh-oh.
Apple Family Reunion,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,Everypony! Jump out!!
Apple Family Reunion,Cindy Morrow,applejack,[crying] Ruined. Everythin' is ruined.
Apple Family Reunion,Cindy Morrow,applejack,"Oh, Granny. I'm so, so sorry."
Apple Family Reunion,Cindy Morrow,granny smith,"Oh, it's alright, child."
Apple Family Reunion,Cindy Morrow,applejack,But it's not alright. Just look at this! The barn and all my plans for the perfect family reunion are completely destroyed!
Apple Family Reunion,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,Maybe that's a good thing.
Apple Family Reunion,Cindy Morrow,applejack,How can that possibly be a good thing?
Apple Family Reunion,Cindy Morrow,granny smith,"Applejack, you had us so caught up in all the doin', we haven't had a second to enjoy the company of the folks we've been doin' it with!"
Apple Family Reunion,Cindy Morrow,applejack,Really?
Apple Family Reunion,Cindy Morrow,applejack,"[sighs] Oh, Granny Smith, here you let me be in charge of creatin' great memories, and the only thing anypony's gonna remember about this reunion... is that it was the worst one we ever had."
Apple Family Reunion,Cindy Morrow,granny smith,"Oh, hey now... everypony's still here, ain't they? Still plenty of time to make good memories! You've just got to give everypony a chance to actually make 'em."
Apple Family Reunion,Cindy Morrow,applejack,The family photo! Guess we can't take it in front of the barn this year... unless... Everypony! I have one more activity!
Apple Family Reunion,Cindy Morrow,granny smith,Applejack...
Apple Family Reunion,Cindy Morrow,applejack,"Trust me, Granny Smith. This'll be one we'll remember for all the right reasons."
Apple Family Reunion,Cindy Morrow,applejack,Yee-hoo!
Apple Family Reunion,Cindy Morrow,applejack,"Come on, Apple family! Let's get to it! Wee-hoo!"
Apple Family Reunion,Cindy Morrow,applejack,"Raise this barn, raise this barn One, two, three, four Together, we can raise this barn One, two, three, four"
Apple Family Reunion,Cindy Morrow,applejack,Whoo-whee!
Apple Family Reunion,Cindy Morrow,applejack,"Raise this barn, oh, raise this barn One, two, three, four Together, we can raise this barn One, two, three, four"
Apple Family Reunion,Cindy Morrow,applejack,"Come on, Apples! Get 'er done!"
Apple Family Reunion,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,"Look at us, we're family"
Apple Family Reunion,Cindy Morrow,applejack,Workin' together thankfully
Apple Family Reunion,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,"We Apples, we are proud to say"
Apple Family Reunion,Cindy Morrow,applejack,"Bow to your partner, circle right Get down if you're scared of heights Forward back and twirl around That barn's gonna be the best in town"
Apple Family Reunion,Cindy Morrow,applejack,Yee-haw! Attagirl!
Apple Family Reunion,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,"Alright, let's get to it!"
Apple Family Reunion,Cindy Morrow,applejack,"Take your brushes, young and old Together, paint it, bright and bold Turn 'em round quick by the left elbow Grab a new partner, here we go"
Apple Family Reunion,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,Yeah!
Apple Family Reunion,Cindy Morrow,granny smith,Oh!
Apple Family Reunion,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,I can't wait for the next reunion!
Apple Family Reunion,Cindy Morrow,babs seed,Me neither!
Apple Family Reunion,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,"I mean, obviously we have to get together before then!"
Apple Family Reunion,Cindy Morrow,babs seed,[chuckles] Obviously.
Apple Family Reunion,Cindy Morrow,granny smith,"Oh, you did it, Applejack! You put on a reunion that everypony will remember!"
Apple Family Reunion,Cindy Morrow,applejack,Just had a couple minor hiccups along the way.
Apple Family Reunion,Cindy Morrow,granny smith,"Yeah, just a couple."
Apple Family Reunion,Cindy Morrow,granny smith,"Ohohoh, that's a good one."
Apple Family Reunion,Cindy Morrow,apple bloom,Oh!
Apple Family Reunion,Cindy Morrow,applejack,"Dear Princess Celestia,"
Apple Family Reunion,Cindy Morrow,applejack,"Today I learned a great lesson about family, which, if you think about it, is really the first group of friends you ever make. Turns out that when you're with folks you care about, you don't have to do much to make that time memorable. Even the simplest of activities can take on a whole lotta meanin'! And you'll find that you'll remember the ""who"" long after you've forgotten the ""what""."
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,spike,"Six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve."
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,Huh. That's not that many.
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,spike,Are you kidding? How are you supposed to read twelve books in one weekend?
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,Princess Celestia obviously thinks I can or she would never have assigned them to me. I'm not planning on letting her down.
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,spike,"Well, I hope you're not planning on sleeping then, either."
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"Actually, Spike, why don't you take the day off?"
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,spike,Really?
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,Why not? These books are gonna keep me busy for a while.
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,spike,Hmm... I do have a long list of things I've been dying to do!
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,spike,"""Touch nose with tongue."" Eeeng... done! ""Play bongos on my belly."""
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,spike,"Done! ""Smell my dirty feet."" [sniffs] [sigh] Done! Huh, that didn't take nearly as long as I thought it would."
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,spike,"What to do, what to do..."
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,spike,[gasps] A hot air balloon ride!
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,spike,[gasps] Oh no! Wait! Runaway balloon! Gah!
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,spike,[groans] Sorry!
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,spike,"[relieved sigh] That was a close one. I-if I didn't know better, I would swear that I was in the middle of the dark and scary Everfree Forest."
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,applejack,"Come 'n' get me, ya big goons! [to Spike] Run!"
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,spike,I'm running! I'm running!
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,applejack,Whew!
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,spike,"Wow, Applejack! That was amazing! I mean, you rocketed those boulders at them like they were... rockets! Pow, pow, pow pow pow! You saved my life! [softly] You... saved... my life."
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,applejack,"Aw, don't mention it, Spike. C'mon, we should be headin' on back, now."
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,spike,"Man, am I lucky you were out here. Uh, why were you out here?"
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,applejack,"Saw the balloon floatin' by with nopony in it, came out here to investigate. Guess you did too, huh?"
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,spike,"Uh... yeah... I was investigating the runaway hot air balloon too! So, uh, now that the mystery's been solved, let's get outta here, huh?"
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,applejack,"Thanks for walkin' me home, Spike. That was mighty kind of you. But now I have chores that need tendin' to, so see you later."
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,spike,What chores? I'll do them!
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,applejack,"That's sweet, but you don't have<U+0096>"
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,spike,It's the least I can do! You saved my life! I need to repay the favor.
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,applejack,"Shoot, Spike, that's what friends do for each other. You don't need to repay the favor."
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,spike,"Yes, I do!"
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,applejack,"Sugar, it's okay, it's not necessary."
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,spike,"Applejack, you don't understand! This is something I really need to do!"
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,applejack,"Well, I'd hate to get in the way of doin' somethin' you need to do..."
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,spike,Great! What should I do?
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,applejack,"Uh... Apple Bloom's over yonder givin' little Piggington a bath. I was gonna lend her a hoof, but maybe you could lend her one instead."
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,spike,On the double!
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,spike,Applejack said I could help you!
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,apple bloom,Great! I could use all the help I can get!
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,spike,"Heh, wait 'til Applejack sees how you sparkle!"
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,spike,Ta-da!
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,applejack,"Good job, you two."
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,apple bloom,"Applejack, is it okay if I get goin'? I don't wanna be late for my Crusaders meeting. We're gettin' fitted for water skis!"
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,applejack,"Heh, you definitely don't wanna be late for that."
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,apple bloom,"Water skiin' cutie mark, here I come!"
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,applejack,"Spike, you can head on out too. I reckon you have repaid me in full so we are officially even Steven."
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,spike,"What? Ohhh no. We aren't even close to being even Steven! Please, Applejack, you must allow me to assist you further!"
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,applejack,"I dunno, Spike. Just don't feel right to have you, uh, doin' things for me."
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,spike,Please?
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,applejack,"Really, you don't<U+0096>"
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,spike,Pretty please?
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,applejack,It's just not necessary<U+0096>
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,spike,Pretty pretty pretty please?
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,applejack,"[sigh] Oh, all right. You can help Granny Smith and me bake some<U+0096>"
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,spike,Pies! Pies! I'm helping Applejack make some pies!
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,granny smith,"Uh, Spike, little feller, could you get us some more eggs?"
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,spike,"Uh, oops, sorry, Applejack. Lemme get something to clean that up!"
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,applejack,"[sighs] Appreciate all your help today, sugarcube, but... I can take it from here."
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,spike,Don't be ridiculous! It is my honor and my duty! Today's just the beginning!
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,applejack,What's that now?
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,spike,"You saved my life! [belches] According to the ""Spike the Dragon Code"", I owe you a life debt and must serve you."
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,granny smith,"Now, what about Twilight? Doesn't she need your help and such?"
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,spike,"[breathes fire] Huh, you're right. I better break the news to Twilight. I just hope she doesn't take it too hard... Be right back!"
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,spike,"Come on, Spike, this is your personal, moral, ethical dragon code we're talking about! You have to do this! It's not like you and Twilight won't be friends anymore... but it won't be the same... but it has to be done. Twilight, Applejack just saved my life from horrible, dragon-eating timberwolves!"
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,Mm-hmm...
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,spike,"And, as you are aware, I adhere to my dragon code, and this means I must serve her for the rest of my natural born days! I'm sure you understand."
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,Mm-hmm...
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,spike,It's... been an honor... being your faithful assistant.
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,Sounds good.
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,spike,She said it was okay.
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,spike,"So, with Twilight's blessing, I'm free to follow my code and serve you until<U+0096>"
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,spike,"Well, until forever!"
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,applejack,"Listen, sugarcube, I completely respect your ""dragon code""... Truly I do, but I just can't cotton with you permanently servin' me."
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,spike,"Please, Applejack, my dragon code is a part of me! I have to be true to myself! If you don't let me do this, I won't be a noble dragon anymore!"
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,applejack,"Oh, well, I can't have you feelin' like you're not a noble dragon now, can I?"
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,spike,"Great! Then from here on in, your wish is my command."
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,applejack,"Oh, uh, okay... I would like you to... hmm... huh... oh! ...Help me take some of the pie you made to..."
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,spike,Rarity?
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,applejack,"Uh, sure, why not?"
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,spike,I helped bake it.
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,rarity,Eugh.
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,spike,You even look good when you're chewing... [laughs nervously] W-who looks good when they're chewing?
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,spike,Aren't you gonna have some more?
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,rarity,I... had a big lunch!
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,spike,It's ten in the morning.
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,rarity,Breakfast. A big breakfast.
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,spike,Ohhh. Okay.
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,applejack,Maybe you could take her plate back to the kitchen and wash it off?
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,spike,As you wish!
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,rarity,What was that all about?
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,applejack,"[sighs] I saved Spike from some timberwolves in the Everfree Forest, and now he thinks he has to serve me forever."
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,rarity,"[delighted squeal] Oh, what I wouldn't give to have somepony forever in my debt! I'd get them to organize my closets, and give me pedicures, and help me with my sewing and<U+0096>"
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,applejack,"Okay, I get it, havin' somepony to do things for you would be a dream come true. But I don't feel right havin' Spike thinkin' he owes me somethin'. You tasted that pie. Sometimes, his help isn't that helpful."
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,spike,Do you... have a broom I could borrow?
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,"AJ, Rarity, what's happening?"
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,rarity,Applejack saved Spike's life and now he has to serve her forever.
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,Sweet! What are you having him do? Wash your laundry? Clean your room? Help you with your unfinished novel? Mine's about this awesome Pegasus who's the best flyer ever and becomes the captain of the Wonderbolts!
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,rarity,[sarcastic] How ever did you come up with that ingeniously woven intricate plot line?
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,Just came to me.
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,applejack,"Thing is, I don't really want him to serve me forever, but I don't know how to get him to stop."
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,"That's easy! Just make him help you with something really, really hard."
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,applejack,I dunno. I don't want him to get hurt.
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,Puh-lease. He'll quit way before there's even a chance of getting hurt!
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,"[hushed, to Applejack] Leave this to me. [to Spike] Sooo, Spike, Applejack was gonna help me stack some hay so I could practice smashing through it, but I'm feeling extra, extra powerful today."
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,applejack,You are?
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,"Yeah, I am. So instead of hay, I'm gonna smash through rocks!"
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,spike,Rocks?
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,Yeah! A huge tower of rocks! And you're gonna build it!
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,spike,I am?
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,"Yeah, I mean, unless you don't wanna help Applejack..."
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,spike,I do! It is Spike's dragon code!
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,Then get to it! [to Applejack] Trust me. This is gonna work like a charm!
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,"Huh. I was sure he'd give up after, like, three rocks."
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,fluttershy,"Oh, goodness. If it'd been me, I'd have just pretended I didn't have anything for him to do."
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,applejack,Why didn't I think of that?
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,spike,[yelling] Is this high enough?
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,applejack,"That's plenty high! Come on down, Spike!"
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,Bad news: He actually ended up building the whole rock tower. Good news... [nervously] I've got a rock tower to knock down.
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,spike,"Haha, yeah! You can do it! Haha, hahah, alright, yeah!"
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,spike,That... was... awesome!
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,spike,"Wanna do it again, Rainbow Dash? Applejack can rebuild it for you. And when I say ""Applejack"", I of course mean me!"
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,[dazed] Sure! Why not...?
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,applejack,"No! I mean, I don't think Rainbow Dash needs any more of your help. My help. She doesn't need it. Right, Rainbow Dash?"
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,Bbbbrrr. Yeah. I guess I'm good. For now.
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,applejack,"And so am I! I just can't think of one more thing I need help with, so you don't have to do anything else."
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,spike,W-What do you mean you can't think of anything else I can help with?
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,applejack,Exactly that! There's nothin' else. I don't want you to do anything.
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,spike,"If I don't help you, how will I know I'm a noble dragon?"
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,applejack,"Well, I<U+0096>"
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,spike,"Maybe there's things you need help with, but you don't even realize you need help with!"
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,fluttershy,"If she needed help, I think she'd realize it."
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,spike,Maybe not! Maybe Applejack needs help realizing what she needs help with. Like... maybe your back itches!
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,applejack,Huuuuh... that does feel... good...
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,spike,"[laughs] See? Or you might need help remembering your favorite song! ""The dragon is the finest creature ever, there's more to him than just guarding treasure..."""
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,fluttershy,I don't think that's her favorite s<U+0096>
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,spike,Or... you might need help breathing!
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,applejack,Breathin'? I certainly do not<U+0096>
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,spike,"See? There are plenty of things I can help you with, and you don't even have to trouble yourself with thinking of them!"
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,applejack,"No, I'll think of 'em. Lemme think of 'em."
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,spike,As you wish.
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,applejack,"Twilight? Twilight, are you there? Twilight!"
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,Agh!
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,applejack,"Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you."
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"[sighs] No, it's okay, I need to take a break anyway. What's going on?"
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,applejack,"I know Spike told you that he was gonna follow his dragon code, and serve me forever for savin' him from the timberwolves, and that you were okay with it, but<U+0096>"
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"Wait, what?"
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,applejack,He said he told you all about it. I'm guessin' maybe you were a little distracted when he told you.
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"Um, maybe a little..."
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,applejack,"I should've realized you wouldn't have let him go so easily. Well, now that you know what's goin' on, maybe you could talk some sense into him!"
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"Oh, Applejack, I wish I could, but this is dragon code we're talking about. Surely you know how important the dragon code is to a dragon!"
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,applejack,I sure am startin' to.
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"Hm, there's only one other way Spike is gonna fulfill the debt he feels he owes you."
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,spike,"Seventy, seventy-one, seventy-two, seventy-three, seventy-four, seventy-five..."
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,applejack,"All right, y'all, here's the deal. Spike needs to save my life."
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,And you want us to shoot you out of a cannon towards a hornet's nest and give Spike a butterfly net so he can catch you mere seconds before you hit the nest and are stung by a thousand angry hornets! I'll wear this mustache.
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,applejack,No. I am gonna be attacked by a timberwolf!
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,Can I still wear the mustache?
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,applejack,"When I give the signal, Pinkie Pie and Rarity will come runnin' out of the woods, bein' pursued by the timberwolf. I'll start to run too, but then pretend to get my hoof stuck. I'll ask Spike to help me dislodge it, and he will, and I'll be able to get away from the terrifyin' timberwolf! Havin' saved me from certain doom, Spike will then consider us even. Everybody get it?"
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,I'll do my best.
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,rarity,Mm-hmm.
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,Just one question.
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,applejack,Yes? [beat] No.
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,[sighs] Suit yourself.
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,rarity,"[clears throat] We are all ready to play our parts, ahem, but are you sure you are ready to play yours, Applejack?"
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,applejack,What d'you mean?
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,rarity,"Show us your best ""damsel in distress"" move."
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,applejack,"Uh... Oh, well, aheh, how's this? Hooooooo."
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,rarity,"Absolutely horrendous! Okay, this needs some serious work! Now, first, you must lift your foreleg up to your forehead, like so<U+0096>"
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,spike,[in distance] Applejack?
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,applejack,"No time! Here he comes! Uh... over here, Spike!"
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,spike,[pants] You said you had something else you needed me to do?
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,applejack,"Oh, yes, I, I was just hopin' you could maybe, uh, sweep up all those leaves for a compost pile, and<U+0096>"
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,spike,"But of course. Oh, by the way, there are exactly twenty-four million, five hundred and sixty-seven thousand, eight hundred and thirty seven blades of grass at Sweet Apple Acres."
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,applejack,I can't believe you counted every single one of 'em...
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,spike,You asked me to.
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,spike,"And, as a noble dragon and follower of my dragon code, I<U+0096>"
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,fluttershy,That was very convincing!
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,rarity,[screaming] Timberwolf! [sobbing] We are doomed!
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,rarity,[to Applejack] See? Like that.
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,applejack,"[unconvincingly] Oh no! I seem to have got my hoof caught in between two rocks! I cannot run away! I am a damsel in distress! Help me, Spike!"
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,spike,Wait a minute.
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,applejack,"No, no, don't wait a minute. Save me from the terrifyin' timberwolf!"
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,spike,"Well, he would be terrifying if he wasn't a fake! You got the clomping on his claws..."
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,spike,"...The roar was spot on, and the detail on his face is pretty good. But you forgot one thing: his breath! You could smell a real timberwolf's breath from a mile<U+0096> [sniffs] [laughs] Too late, I'm already on<U+0096>"
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,Timberwolf!
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,spike,Timberwolf!
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,applejack,Whooooah!
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,applejack,Ow!
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,spike,"Uh oh... Applejack, come on!"
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,applejack,[grunting] I can't! I'm really stuck!
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,spike,No more messing around! Let's go!
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,applejack,[grunting] Come on...
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,applejack,"Forget it, Spike! You gotta get out of here! Would you just forget your dragon code already and go?!"
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,spike,No! I have to save you!
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,What happened to you guys back there? Thought you were right behind us!
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,applejack,"My hoof was stuck, and that timberwolf was coming right at me!"
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,rarity,"Wait, you were actually stuck?"
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,spike,Uh-huh!
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,applejack,"But Spike picked up a pebble, and rocketed that thing right at the huge timberwolf's mouth, and saved my life!"
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,spike,"Aw, it was nothing."
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,applejack,"It was somethin' alright! 'Course, I wouldn't've needed help if I hadn't been tryin' to stage a fake timberwolf attack in the first place."
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,spike,"Yeah, what was that all about?"
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,applejack,"[sighs] I know this code thing's important to you, but if somethin' like this comes up in the future, think maybe we can go back to my code, say ""that's what friends do"" and leave it at that? I promise I won't think of you as any less noble."
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,spike,"Sounds good to me. But, maybe let's just try to avoid situations where one of us actually needs the other one to save their life?"
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,applejack,You got yourself a deal.
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"Thanks, Spike."
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,spike,Happy to help!
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,Don't know what I'd do without you.
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,spike,"No, really! I'm really really really happy to help you!"
Spike at Your Service,Merriwether Williams; story by Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,[laughs] Oh...
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,pinkie pie,I love it when Princess Celestia comes to Ponyville! I got my hooves shined just like Rarity for the occasion. Ya like?
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,rarity,I certainly do!
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,twilight sparkle,I'm surprised she's not here yet.
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,spike,[sighs] I wonder what's taking so long?
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,twilight sparkle,And where are Applejack and Fluttershy?
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,rarity,Fluttershy's detained helping Applejack with a mishap at Sweet Apple Acres. They'll be along.
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,spike,"But, I still don't get why the Princess would be so late."
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,twilight sparkle,She's bringing an important visitor. That could be part of it.
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,rainbow dash,A visitor who's important and slow.
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,rarity,"Maybe it's somepony so terribly important, she still had many more terribly important things to do before she got here."
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,spike,"[gasp] Maybe the visitor has a deer antler, a goat leg, a bat wing, and a snake tail!"
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,twilight sparkle,"Yeah, right. That's Discord."
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,rarity,"Why in the wide, wide world of Equestria would Princess Celestia bring along someone like that?"
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,spike,M-m-maybe you should ask... her!
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,rarity,Huh?
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,twilight sparkle,"With all due respect, Princess Celestia, how could you bring Discord here?! [clears throat] Your majesty."
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,princess celestia,"I'm fully aware that the last time Discord was here, he created serious havoc."
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,rainbow dash,"If by ""serious havoc"" you mean ""turning Ponyville into the chaos capital of the world""..."
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,rarity,...and tricking us all into being the opposite of our true selves...
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,pinkie pie,And making yummy delicious chocolate milk rain all over the place without a single dollop of whipped cream to go with it anywhere in sight! Not a single dollop!
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,princess celestia,"Yes, I understand. But I have use for Discord's magic if it can be reformed to serve good instead of evil. This is why I've brought Discord here, because I believe that you are the ponies who can help him do just that."
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,spike,This will never work! This is a disaster! How will we ever control him?! We're doomed!
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,princess celestia,Need I remind you that you are the ponies who turned him back into stone like this in the first place?
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,twilight sparkle,I suppose we can just use the Elements of Harmony against him again if it gets out of hand.
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,spike,"Uh, w-w-we probably need a volunteer to run away from here right away to get them. I'll do it!"
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,princess celestia,"No need, Spike. I have them right here, and I've cast a spell so Discord can't take them and hide them again. Now where is Fluttershy? I believe she may know best how to begin reforming Discord."
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,rainbow dash,Fluttershy? Really?
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,applejack,What's he goin' on about now?
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,fluttershy,Good news. Mr. Beaverton Beaverteeth has agreed to take his dam apart and move it.
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,applejack,"Well, it's about time. My apple trees are so waterlogged, I can practically hear 'em gargle!"
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,fluttershy,"But he says first you'll have to apologize for calling him ""a nuisance""."
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,applejack,Apologize? He's lucky I didn't call him a varmint!
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,fluttershy,[gasps] Mr. Beaverton Beaverteeth! Such language!
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,applejack,"Fine, fine. I apologize."
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,applejack,"[sighs] Thanks, Fluttershy. Don't know what I would've done without you."
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,fluttershy,Glad I could help.
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,rainbow dash,"Hey, slackers! Double time it on over to Ponyville, would ya?! We're all waiting on you!"
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,princess celestia,"I realize that this is a tall order, but I wouldn't ask if I weren't confident you could get him to use magic obediently of his own free will."
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,fluttershy,And... you really think I'll know best how to do that?
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,princess celestia,"I do. Now, I must return to Canterlot for Equestria's royal summit. You may release Discord when ready."
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,twilight sparkle,"Okay, ponies, guess it's time to get started. Let's just hope this releasing spell works."
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,spike,Or... let's not.
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,twilight sparkle,We'd best keep our elements on at all times 'til further notice.
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,twilight sparkle,What do you think you're doing?!
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,pinkie pie,[gasps] Make that bunny cute again! Now!
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,discord,Oh... [sniggers] He's adorable the way he is.
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,discord,"[blows raspberry] You know what else is adorable? You ponies truly believe that you can reform me, and that you're putting your faith in this one here to make it happen. Makes me wanna pinch your little horsey cheeks..."
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,twilight sparkle,How'd you know about that?!
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,discord,Being turned to stone doesn't keep me from hearing every word Celestia says. Although I admit it makes rolling my eyes a challenge.
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,twilight sparkle,"Well, unless you want us to turn you back to stone, you'll zap those animals back the way they were, pronto!"
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,discord,"Oh, you wouldn't dare turn me back to stone and risk disappointing your precious princess."
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,rainbow dash,"Try us, ""Dip-cord""!"
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,fluttershy,You think you can treat poor defenseless animals like that and get away with it?!
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,rainbow dash,"You go, Fluttershy!"
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,fluttershy,"You'd best watch your step, buster, or I'll give you... the Stare!"
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,twilight sparkle,"If it turns out we need to use our elements against you, I'm sure we can convince Princess Celestia it was for a good reason!"
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,fluttershy,"Oh, dear."
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,fluttershy,"He may be horrible, but that doesn't mean we have to act the same way. We should at least try to be hospitable. [to Angel] You don't mind giving up your favorite spot on the couch, do you, Angel Bunny?"
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,fluttershy,"Oh, I'm sorry about Angel. Are you alright?"
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,discord,"Oh, yes. Thank you, Fluttershy, for your concern. If only your pony friends could be as considerate..."
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,rainbow dash,"Don't listen to him, Fluttershy! He's just trying to drive a wedge between us like he always does."
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,discord,Now why in the world would I ever try to do a thing like that?
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,rainbow dash,"So we can't unite and use the Elements of Harmony against you, that's why!"
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,discord,I never thought of that...
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,rainbow dash,You big liar!
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,discord,"Now, look who's a liar. Anyone can plainly see that I'm not big at all."
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,applejack,I can't watch...
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,rainbow dash,We'll be outside.
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,twilight sparkle,You sure you're okay with this?
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,fluttershy,"I know it's not gonna be easy, but Princess Celestia's counting on me. And... I think I actually know what to do."
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,twilight sparkle,You do?
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,fluttershy,I think the key is to befriend him. Being kind to him and letting him be my house guest is probably the best way to do that.
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,twilight sparkle,And you really think that'll work?
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,fluttershy,I think it's worth a try.
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,twilight sparkle,"Okay, but if you need us, all you need to do is whisper ""help"", and we'll be back here with our elements. [to Discord] So watch that goat-legged step of yours, pal!"
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,discord,Wh-what?! Look at me! I'm practically reformed already.
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,rarity,She's really alright with him staying there?
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,twilight sparkle,That's what she said.
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,rainbow dash,"Personally, I think we should come up with a backup plan, in case this whole ""befriending"" business doesn't work out."
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,rarity,"Rainbow Dash is right. This is Discord we are talking about, girls. It wouldn't be a bad idea to have another trick up our sleeves."
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,twilight sparkle,And I think I know just the trick.
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,fluttershy,"Discord? Oh, there you are. Listen, Discord, I just want to make sure you know that if there's anything I can do to<U+0096> uh, umm, are you eating... paper?"
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,fluttershy,"Well, um... I'm just heading out, so you just make yourself at home while I'm gone."
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,discord,"Buh-bye, have a nice time! Everything is fine here. Bye bye... Bye bye..."
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,discord,"You like carrots, Angel? I'm playing your owner for a fool! [laughs] How d'ya like them carrots?"
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,twilight sparkle,"That's weird. The spell I had in mind isn't in here. Spike, where are the other books I asked you to pull?"
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,spike,"Right here, Twilight."
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,twilight sparkle,I really want to have a reforming spell up and running pronto.
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,spike,But what if he makes the Elements of Harmony disappear like he did last time?
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,twilight sparkle,"Princess Celestia cast a spell protecting them, remember? Uh-oh."
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,spike,What's wrong?
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,discord,"[eating] Are you sure this isn't overdoing it? You said to make myself at home while you were gone, but I wouldn't want to overstep my bounds."
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,fluttershy,"Nngh... I did say that, so... if this makes you more comfortable... by all means, please feel free."
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,discord,"Oh. Well, it does, very much so. You're so very kind, my dear Fluttershy. I always knew that you were the understanding one, not like those nasty friends of yours."
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,fluttershy,[gasps] My friends aren't nasty!
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,twilight sparkle,"Fluttershy! Fluttershy, can you hear me?"
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,fluttershy,Goodness! I hear Twilight!
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,twilight sparkle,"Fluttershy, what's going on? Are you okay?!"
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,fluttershy,"We're fine. Everything's going great. Isn't it, Angel?"
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,twilight sparkle,"We've come to get you away from Discord! He's just terrible and, from the looks of it, completely out of control!"
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,fluttershy,"Oh, but you're wrong! We're making great progress!"
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,fluttershy,I'm earning his trust by giving him a little space to be himself.
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,spike,"Hate to break it to ya, but he used that ""space to be himself"" to tear out all the reforming spells from the library!"
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,fluttershy,That does explain the paper eating...
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,twilight sparkle,He ate them?! Ugggghhhh!
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,fluttershy,But we aren't gonna need a spell. He's already really considering being reformed! He said so.
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,twilight sparkle,And you believed him?
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,fluttershy,"If I'm going to be his friend, I have to start by giving him the benefit of the doubt! Tell you what. Bring all the ponies over for a dinner party this evening, and I'll bet his manners will have really improved by then. I'll even get him to put the cottage back on the ground first."
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,twilight sparkle,[sighs] Alright. Dinner it is.
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,rainbow dash,"Ugh, I can't believe we're having a dinner party with Discord!"
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,rarity,This evening is sure to be a disaster. Glad I didn't bother wearing my fanciest outfit.
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,twilight sparkle,Fluttershy thinks this is the way to reform Discord and asked us to give it a chance.
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,discord,"Oh, our pony guests! [upper class voice] We're so delighted that you've come. Please, do come in."
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,fluttershy,See what a beautiful job he did helping? Discord set the entire table himself. I'm so proud.
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,discord,"May I take your... [clears throat] hats, ladies?"
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,twilight sparkle,"Hang on to your elements, girls. It's gonna be a bumpy night."
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,fluttershy,"As you all know, Princess Celestia hoped we'd help Discord use his magic for good instead of evil."
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,fluttershy,"Pinkie Pie, care for some gravy?"
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,pinkie pie,You bet!
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,discord,Allow me.
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,pinkie pie,"Oh, what a cute little gravy boat you are! Yes you are! Yes you are!"
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,rainbow dash,That's one creepy little gravy boat if you ask me.
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,fluttershy,"Oh, come on now, Dashie. You're not even giving this a chance."
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,rainbow dash,Hey! That's hot!
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,discord,Whoops! [chuckles] I'm so sorry!
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,rainbow dash,He did that on purpose!
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,discord,"Oh, well, I don't know about that. Mistakes happen. Oh, look, everypony, dancing candles!"
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,rainbow dash,I'm not falling for that! Discord's just trying to distract us from<U+0096>
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,rainbow dash,"[grunts] Hey! Knock it off! I suppose that's another ""mistake""?"
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,discord,"No, I think you just made them mad."
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,twilight sparkle,There's something fishy going on.
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,fluttershy,Discord?
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,discord,"Well, it's hardly my fault if the soup tureen finds the term ""something fishy"" to be offensive."
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,rarity,Not the dress! Not the dress!
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,applejack,That tureen's only doin' what you're makin' it do!
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,fluttershy,Now let's not jump to any conclusions.
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,rainbow dash,Fluttershy! Can't you see what he's doing? He's playing innocent with you so you'll never agree to use the Elements of Harmony against him!
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,discord,"Oh, well, that's a bit harsh, isn't it?"
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,rainbow dash,"You see what I'm saying, right, Fluttershy? Fluttershy!"
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,fluttershy,"You know what I see? I see that Discord's far from perfect, but I also see none of you giving him a chance!"
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,rainbow dash,What's gotten into you?! Why do you keep cutting him so much slack?
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,fluttershy,Because that's what friends do.
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,discord,We're friends?
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,fluttershy,"Why, of course! I can't remember my house ever being this lively before you came along."
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,discord,"Oh... Well, I've... never really had a friend before."
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,fluttershy,"Well, now you do!"
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,fluttershy,"Now is not a good time, Angel. We're having a dinner party."
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,applejack,Hold up! I-I think he's tryin' to tell us somethin'!
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,rarity,"Oh, oh, oh! Sweet Apple Acres?"
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,rainbow dash,"Flooding at Sweet Apple Acres! And we all know who's behind that now, don't we?!"
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,discord,"Who, me?"
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,rainbow dash,"Oh, give it a rest! What do you think of your ""friend"" now, Fluttershy?"
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,applejack,"I've never seen the floodin' this bad! They've built dams 'round here before, but never like this! What's goin' on?"
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,fluttershy,[gasps] Such language! [sighs] It's no use. They won't listen to a word I say!
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,rainbow dash,"You see Discord's behind all this, right?"
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,fluttershy,"Oh, of course I do! Do you all think I'm a silly, gullible fool?"
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,fluttershy,"I've just been trying to gain his friendship any way I can, so he'd come to trust and listen to me!"
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,discord,"Hey there, Fluttershy, you want a turn? The water's great!"
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,fluttershy,Time to see if it worked.
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,discord,"Fluttershy, oh, there you are. A sight for sore eyes."
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,fluttershy,"As you can see, there's a big mess down here at Sweet Apple Acres."
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,discord,"Oh, yes. Awful business, that. Mm."
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,fluttershy,"It is awful. This is Applejack's home, and it's being destroyed by innocent creatures who would never be acting this way if it weren't for your reckless behavior. You need to fix this."
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,discord,"Oh, yes, very well, I will fix it. I only ask one thing in return."
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,fluttershy,Yes?
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,discord,I ask that you never use your Element of Harmony against me. As a sign of our friendship.
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,fluttershy,I will never use my Element of Harmony against you.
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,fluttershy,"Discord! That's not fixing it! Why, I oughta..."
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,discord,"Where are you going? What's wrong, pal?"
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,fluttershy,Don't call me your pal!
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,discord,"Oh, pfft, come skating with me, and we'll let bygones be bygones."
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,spike,"Here you go, Fluttershy! Game on!"
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,twilight sparkle,He fixes this or he goes back to being stone! Princess Celestia will understand!
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,fluttershy,"I made a promise not to use my element against him, and I'm going to keep it."
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,fluttershy,[growls] Not. Your. Friend!
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,discord,"Who cares? I can do whatever I want, whenever I want. I'm Discord, the master of chaos! You think you can boss Discord around? You think I'm just going to turn all this back because you say so? Because if I don't, I'll lose the one friend I ever had? [pause] Oh. Oh. Well played, Fluttershy. Well played."
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,discord,"I like it better my way, but... I guess when you're friends, you can't always have things exactly your way all the time, eh?"
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,discord,"Yes, Princess, I'm ready to use my magic for good instead of evil. [under his breath] Most of the time."
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,princess celestia,"Congratulations on your success, ponies. I definitely sense a big change in Discord. [to Twilight] I'll leave the Elements of Harmony with you, Twilight. Just in case."
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,twilight sparkle,"You were right when you said Fluttershy would be the one to find the way to reform Discord. By treating Discord as a friend, she got him to realize that friendship was actually important to him. And something that, once he had, he didn't want to lose."
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,fluttershy,Go on. Say it...
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,discord,[groans] Alright. [quickly] Friendship is magic.
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Dave Polsky; story by Teddy Antonio,fluttershy,See? He can be a real sweetheart once you get to know him.
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,spike,Who are you hooing at?
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,spike,"I know, they're delicious."
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,spike,"Now you see 'em, now you don't. [chewing] [belches] Mm! [singing] This is how you make a jewel cake: stir in some gems, and then you bake. [chewing] Mm-hmm! Gonna, eat, eat it up! Gonna<U+0096> [gasps] What happened to all my jewels?! [drums claws] I had a bowl full of them here, and now I don't! Which means somebody took 'em!"
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,spike,"Who? That's what I'm asking, who?! Who took my jewels?! Oh. I'm who. This cake was gonna be so good! Why? [thump] Why?! [gulps] Whyyyyyyyyy???!!!"
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,spike,[singing] I have no jewels... I have no cake... I'm a sad little dragon... With nothing to<U+0096>
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,spike,...is it?
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,fluttershy,"Oh! Oh goodness, I-I hope I'm not interrupting anything."
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,spike,Well... I do have this cake to not bake...
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,fluttershy,"Oh... sorry, it's a bad time."
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,spike,"Uh, inside joke. Talk to me."
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,fluttershy,It's just that... Princess Cadance needs us to do a great job welcoming the Head of the Equestria Games when she visits the Crystal Empire tomorrow<U+0096>
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,spike,"Oh, I know all about that. As if I wouldn't be any help at welcoming..."
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,fluttershy,"Oh, I don't know what was I thinking. Of course you might be upset for not being invited, and... here I am coming to ask you for a favor. You were probably going to say no anyway. All I had to offer you in exchange was one little jewel."
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,spike,What was that?
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,fluttershy,[yelps] All I have is this jewel.
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,spike,"[slurp] That's a really big one. A really big, juicy, perfect-for-a-cake-topper jewel."
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,fluttershy,Does this mean you'll do it?
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,spike,Yeah... Sure...
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,fluttershy,"Oh, thank you, thank you! So while I'm gone, you'll take care of Angel, and tomorrow is Tuesday, which is his tail-fluffing day, and it's really important for him to look good."
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,spike,"Wait, what? You want me to take care of him?"
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,fluttershy,"Oh, well, yes. But if it's too much trouble, I can always see if there is somepony else."
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,spike,"Uhh... We already agreed on the whole jewel thing, so I'll just..."
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,fluttershy,"Thank you, thank you, thank you! Angel, aren't you just so excited?"
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,fluttershy,See you tomorrow.
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,spike,You know... She's not the only pony with a pet that might need some watching...
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,spike,"All I'm saying is, if Fluttershy thought that her beloved little friend shouldn't be left alone while you're busy in the Crystal Empire, then maybe that's just something to think about."
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,rainbow dash,Tch! Tank's not some fuzzy little bunny. He can take care of himself.
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,rainbow dash,"He's a strong, fearless, and totally together pet."
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,rainbow dash,"Alright. You can watch him, but only because... uh... Tank's got a strict flying regimen, and-and someone needs to make sure that he doesn't slack off while I'm gone."
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,rainbow dash,You know... the two of us are very diligent.
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,spike,"Okay, whatever."
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,rarity,"Yes, yes, more importantly, as for Opal, she likes to eat every thirty six and a half minutes, you groom her with her silken brush, head to toe..."
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,rarity,"...Oh, and don't forget to pooch her pillow out in the middle, that's where she likes it. And the temperature in the room should always be exactly eighty one point four degrees. That's the only way she can get to sleep."
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,rarity,"And, um... hmm... oh, good, so thanks for your help and good luck to you."
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,rainbow dash,A-hem... I think the dragon was expecting a little something for his efforts.
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,spike,Almost as beautiful as the pony who gave it to me...
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,rainbow dash,Shouldn't you be critter-proofing the library or something? Tank has a tendency to<U+0096>
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,spike,"Critter-proofing. Yeah, I'll get right on that. [chuckles] Three down, three to go."
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,spike,"What's that you said, Gummy? Uh-huh. Well, you're just gonna have to ask Pinkie Pie about that one."
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,pinkie pie,"Ask me, ask me!"
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,spike,"Go ahead, ask her!"
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,pinkie pie,Of course you can have another cupcake! Mm? Mm-hm? Yeah? Why didn't you say so? I'll get you a bigger pond immediately.
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,spike,I think what Gummy's trying to say is<U+0096>
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,spike,I think what Gummy's trying to say is that he'd like a little Spike time.
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,pinkie pie,Who wouldn't?! Spike time is the best!
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,spike,"Alas, it doesn't come cheap."
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,rainbow dash,All I'm saying is you might wanna think about a helmet. You only want to get hit in the head by a flying turtle... once.
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,spike,A thousand plus carats of pure deliciousness...
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,applejack,"Looks like you got a regular pet day care in here, Spike. You'll still be able to get some good play time with Winona like you said though, won't ya? She tends to get a little wild if she doesn't get her exercise."
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,spike,"Exercise. Sure, of course."
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,spike,Whoa!
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,twilight sparkle,I don't remember seeing critters on the invite list.
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,applejack,That's 'cause we're leavin' them here with Spike. He's gonna do a little critter-sittin' for us.
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,twilight sparkle,"Oh, really?"
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,fluttershy,"So sorry I'm late. Silly bunny had hidden his brush. Be sure you get plenty on his tail, or it won't get as poofy as he likes it."
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,pinkie pie,"No, no no no. I love you more. No, I love you more! I love you more!!!"
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,fluttershy,"Oh, I promise it'll be okay. I'll fluff your tail twice next week. Three times?"
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,rarity,"Oh, I know. It's a chilly eighty one point two in here. Spike, take care of this, would you please?"
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,spike,"You got it! So, uhh... What are you thinking about that hooting little friend of yours? Suppose you want me to keep an eye on him too."
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,twilight sparkle,That would be nice. You sure you don't already have your hands full?
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,spike,"Nah, pshaw. I'll be fine. But, uh, just between you and me, I gotta give priority to the... paying customers."
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,twilight sparkle,[sigh] You absolutely sure you can do this?
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,spike,"Of course. Wouldn't have agreed to it if I couldn't. Piece of cake. Speaking of cake, I got a little something I need to attend to."
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,twilight sparkle,"Yeah, like keeping an eye on a house full of critters."
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,spike,"[slurp] Uh, yeah, uh, that was totally what I was talking about. Relax. Go to your welcoming thing in the Crystal Empire. Spike's got it all under control."
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,spike,"Alright, sidekicks, front and center!"
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,spike,"There are six of you, but there's only one right here in front of me... Gah! Two! And what I say goes!"
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,spike,"Spike, the boss of you, that's who. One, two, three! Nngh, come on, number four!"
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,spike,Whoa! Guh...
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,spike,"One, two, three, four, five... Argh, who's missing?"
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,spike,Angel.
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,spike,"All I wanted were some jewels. Big, juicy, delicious jewels. Now what do I have? A missing rabbit and<U+0096>"
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,sweetie belle,"Awww, little fluffy Angel Bunny-kins! You're so cute! The natural weaves in his fluff are to die for!"
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,sweetie belle,Isn't Angel just the cutest thing you've ever seen?!
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,spike,"[to Angel] Look, you don't wanna be with me. I'd rather not chase you around all over the place when I could be enjoying some jewel cake. Watch me solve both of our problems. [to the Cutie Mark Crusaders] Y'know, I'm supposed to be watching him, but you all have just hit it off so well that maybe, maybe I could let you take care of him instead."
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,apple bloom,"We would, but we've got some major Crusaders business planned for today!"
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,scootaloo,Major. We're getting our skydiving cutie marks today!
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,cutie mark crusaders,Ha! Yeah!
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,spike,"Well, I suppose, if you've got other plans... It's just, you're so good with them. Like get-a-cutie-mark-for-bunny-sitting good?"
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,apple bloom,A bunny-sittin' cutie mark...
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,sweetie belle,That would be adorable!
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,scootaloo,He does seem to like us.
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,apple bloom,And we haven't exactly figured out how we're gonna pull off this whole skydivin' thing.
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,spike,"You know what? As hard as it's gonna be for me part with these little guys, I think you should probably just take all of them. If you ask me, nngh, the more critters you take care of, the more chances you have of getting some kind of critter-sitting cutie mark. Am I right or am I right?"
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,apple bloom,Sure!
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,spike,Yes!
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,apple bloom,But wait! How're we gonna take good care of them without treats for when they're good?
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,sweetie belle,And we'll need beds for when they're tired!
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,scootaloo,And toys! They need toys!
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,spike,It's an afternoon. They don't need all that stuff. They'll be fine.
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,apple bloom,We need to be able to buy them some things! One jewel might be able to cover it all.
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,spike,Uh... what would I possibly be doing with jewels?
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,apple bloom,"I happen to know for a fact that Applejack gave you a gem to watch Winona, which means..."
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,spike,"Obviously, no one around here is getting a cutie mark for kindness toward a poor, hungry little dragon. Take it or leave it."
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,apple bloom,We'll take it.
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,spike,"[singing] Gonna put in some flour, and add a little sugar for my five de-li-cious jewels!"
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,sweetie belle,[muffled] But pink feathers would look so good with your eyes!
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,spike,Meh... that bird could use a little color.
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,scootaloo,[muffled] Has anyone seen Tank's head? Where's his head?!
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,spike,What have you done to the turtle?!
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,scootaloo,"Ohh, I totally forgot he could do that. Heh."
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,apple bloom,"Yeah, so, pretty sure critter-sittin' cutie marks are out."
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,sweetie belle,And our critter-grooming cutie marks probably aren't going to appear anytime soon either.
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,spike,"[groans] Alright, load 'em up. And you can gimme back that jewel I gave you."
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,apple bloom,"Sorry, we don't have it anymore."
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,spike,What? Why not?!
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,scootaloo,How do you think we paid for the industrial-sized pet hair dryer?
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,spike,[groans] Oh.
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,zecora,Zecora knows just what to do about all this bad mojo that's floating around you.
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,spike,I'm thinking a cage and a great big lock might be next.
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,zecora,Zecora can take the bad away if you do just what I say.
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,spike,Really?
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,zecora,"But before I can do my duty, I am going to need some of your booty."
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,spike,[sighs] Where are you going?
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,zecora,"You think jewels are what you need, but there's no worse mojo than dragon greed."
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,spike,Almost there...
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,granny smith,[suspiciously] Mm-hm...
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,spike,"Just taking good care of everyone's animals. What am I gonna have to do to get this to go away? [sighs] And this is just between you and me, right? No other pony has to hear a word about it?"
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,granny smith,A word about what now?
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,spike,This better be important.
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,spike,Angel.
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,spike,"All I need is to get on for one minute, grab a bunny, and get off! Promise!"
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,scootaloo,Skydiving cutie marks!
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,spike,"Is three ponies enough? [sighs] At least I have you two left, my delectable little treasures."
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,cutie mark crusaders,Crystal Empire?!
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,scootaloo,I've always wanted to see the Crystal Empire!
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,sweetie belle,"I wish I were dressed for it, but still... [squealing] THE CRYSTAL EMPIRE!"
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,spike,"We're not really going! We just needed to get on the train so I can get that rabbit! And when I do, we're off!"
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,scootaloo,What?!
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,apple bloom,That's not fair!
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,spike,There he is!
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,spike,"No, no, no, no, no, no!"
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,apple bloom,"So it seems like the Crystal Empire would be really cold, but I've heard that it's not! It's as warm as can be!"
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,scootaloo,Do you think the walls are crystal? [gasps] Maybe even see-through! Can you imagine see-through walls?
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,spike,Take it! Just take it!
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,scootaloo,So beautiful!
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,spike,"Well, enjoy it while you can, 'cause we're not getting out of this car until we're back in Ponyville!"
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,apple bloom,"There is no way, no how, we're comin' all the way to the Crystal Empire without lookin' around!"
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,spike,Nopony's gonna get past this dragon!
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,apple bloom,Don't make me use this!
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,scootaloo,"Whoa, just whoa."
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,sweetie belle,Ah! I'm in crystal heaven!
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,spike,"Shhh! They're right there! There's the bunny! Please, please, pretty please, don't go down there! I'll fluff your tail! I'll perm, highlight, and blow it out if you'll just stop!"
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,spike,"What do you want?! Name it, and it's yours! [pants] [groans] [kisses] Hyah!"
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,fluttershy,Oh my goodness.
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,spike,Hah! You're coming with me!
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,spike,We made it!
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,sweetie belle,Without seeing the palace!
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,twilight sparkle,I think this car's empty.
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,spike,They're coming this way! Everybody down!
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,sweetie belle,There has to be a better solution!
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,spike,"Shh! Oh, don't sit down, don't sit down!"
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,applejack,Whooeee! My dogs are barkin'.
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,applejack,Did y'all hear that? They really are!
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,rainbow dash,"Huh, bummer Spike had to miss out on all this. He woulda' had fun here."
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,twilight sparkle,I'm sure he's having a great time watching all the critters back at home.
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,applejack,Think he's still got a handle on things?
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,twilight sparkle,"If he's staying calm and collected, I bet he's doing a terrific job as a leader."
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,spike,"Go ahead, bunny. Do your worst. I deserve it. I ignored you, tried to pawn you off on someone else, I didn't take these silly things out, or fluff this like I was supposed to. I wasn't really thinking about you at all. Any of you. Just wanted the jewels. I hope you'll all forgive me someday."
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,spike,You will? [stomach growls] Oh great. I'm gonna be the one who gives us away.
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,applejack,You all hear that?
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,applejack,"I can't wait to scratch the belly on Winona. Oh, I miss her."
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,spike,Hello! Thought we'd meet you at the station!
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,sweetie belle,"So we could hear all about the Crystal Empire, and find out if you brought us one of the crystal snow globes that they sell at the train station!"
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,rarity,How did you know about the snow globes?
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,sweetie belle,Um... lucky guess?
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,twilight sparkle,"I've gotta hand it to you, Spike. You did a really good job of taking care of the animals."
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,fluttershy,"Oh, Spike, Angel looks perfect! You did such a good job fluffing his tail."
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,spike,"Yeah, well... we're like this now."
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,spike,You know who.
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,twilight sparkle,"So what are you thinking? Bake 'em into a jewel pie? Ooh, six-layer gem cake sounds pretty good!"
Just for Sidekicks,Corey Powell,spike,"Yeah, it does. [slurps] It really really does. [pause] Whyyyyyyyyy???!!!"
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,You absolutely sure you can do this?
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,spike,"Of course. Wouldn't have agreed to it if I couldn't. Piece of cake. Speaking of cake, I got a little something I need to attend to."
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"Yeah, like keeping an eye on a house full of critters."
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,spike,"[slurp] Uh, yeah, uh, that was totally what I was talking about. Relax. Go to your welcoming thing in the Crystal Empire. Spike's got it all under control."
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,"Hurry up, Twilight! We can't miss our train!"
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,applejack,"Oh, this is gonna be a real treat. Princess Cadance said she'd never seen the Crystal Ponies so excited."
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,Duh! Of course they're excited. They're up for the Equestria Games. It's only the biggest sporting event in all of Equestria.
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,rarity,Didn't Cloudsdale host the Equestria Games one year?
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,No. Cloudsdale should have hosted the games one year. I'll never forget when we got the bad news.
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,young rainbow dash,NOOOOOOOOOOO!
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,These Crystal Ponies lost a thousand years to an evil king's curse. They've had enough bad news. No way we're letting them experience the pain of losing out on these games.
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,Exactly. Princess Cadance is counting on us to do our part to convince the Games Inspector to choose the Crystal Empire. And we are not gonna let her down. Are we?
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,NOOOOOOOOOOO! What? I was just answering Twilight's question.
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,"[through megaphone] Okay, everypony, great job! Sounds like we're ready."
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,One more time from the top.
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,rarity,"Oh, please! I think that was perfect."
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,applejack,"[sighs] But we've run this, like, twelve times already. I think we've got it."
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,Cadance said the Games Inspector really puts folks through the wringer on her visits. There's no margin for error here. And this time we need to practice the steps.
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,applejack,On a train car?
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,You heard the pony! On your hooves!
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,applejack,"[sighs] Probably should've watched our step while we were still on it, too."
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,Wow! The Crystal Empire looks crystallier than ever!
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,applejack,They must have everypony in the Empire out sprucing it up!
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,This must be why we were asked to handle the welcome committee routine.
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,And it's probably also because we'll be awesome at it.
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,applejack,Princess Cadance was right. These ponies do look pretty darn excited.
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,"Yup, I remember that feeling. But not as much as I remember the crushing wave of disappointment that came when things didn't work out. That right there. That is the face I do not want to see."
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,We're here.
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,princess cadance,[giggles] There are my girls.
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,rarity,"Oh, my. This is spectacular. Please, everypony, stand back! I need air!"
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,princess cadance,Go ahead and try whatever you like. It's all complimentary for the welcome committee.
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,rarity,Ooh-hoo-hoo-hoo!
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,princess cadance,"That over there is a crystal mud bath, which relaxes your body and rejuvenates your coat. Now, I realize it can be kind of strange to climb into mud, but if you'll just give it a chance, I'm sure<U+0096>"
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,Woo-hoo!
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"Pinkie, no!"
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,"[laughing] Ahh, so relaxing!"
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,Pinkie Pie! Honestly!
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,princess cadance,"Go ahead, have a good time while I get my ceremonial headdress done."
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,rarity,Ceremonial... headdress?
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,princess cadance,"When meeting with important guests, it was tradition for rulers of the Crystal Empire to weave crystals into their manes in a very specific way. The Games Inspector is known for doing her homework. She'll certainly be expecting my look to reflect the importance of her visit."
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,princess cadance,Oh. Well... I hope she's better soon. Do any of the other stylists here know how to do the traditional royal ceremonial headdress?
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,princess cadance,Oh. [breaths in] [breaths out] Just a... small detail.
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,"Whoa, whoa, whoa! You're trying to land the Equestria Games here. There is no such thing as a small detail!"
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,Rainbow Dash!
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,rarity,I suppose... I could give it a shot.
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,princess cadance,"Oh, Rarity, you would do that for me?"
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,"Way to step it up, Rare!"
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,princess cadance,"Fortunately, I have all the precise instructions right here."
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,rarity,"Oh, my!"
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,princess cadance,You sure you're up to this?
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,rarity,Working on the hair of royalty on such an auspicious occasion is the opportunity of a lifetime! I will give it everything I've got!
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,See? No worries!
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,rarity,"Besides, the Games Inspector isn't expected for several hours. I'll have plenty of time to figure out exactly how to... do... this..."
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,princess cadance,"Oh, Rarity, that's wonderful! [to Golden Hooves] You said you had a second bit of news?"
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,What!? You couldn't have told her that news first!? That's fifteen minutes from now!
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,fluttershy,"Oh, my goodness!"
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,[breathes in] [breathes out] How long before Cadance is ready?
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,rarity,Hmmmm... I'm sure to find some shortcuts.
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,Can you have her back at the castle when we're done?
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,rarity,Done.
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"Okay, we'll be fine. Everypony, just be on the look out for the pony with the flower print luggage."
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,"Easy peasy, pudding in the freezy!"
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"We bring the Games Inspector back to the castle, put on our big welcome committee how-do-you-do and then..."
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,Put the pudding out to thaw before you eat it or you'll crack a tooth?
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,I'll just ignore that. We need to remember that the Games Inspector arriving early is probably part of a plan to psych us out.
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,What do you mean?
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,"You said it yourself. She's got a rep for trying to catch hosts off-guard, just to see if we can handle the kind of massive pressure that comes with hosting the Equestria Games."
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,fluttershy,"Oh, no... We're gonna blow it..."
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,"Not if we always stay one step ahead and don't fall for any of her mind games. Anything she throws at us, we just need to remember she's testing us and roll with it."
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,"Excuse me, ma'am?"
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,ms. peachbottom,"Ms. Yes, what is it?"
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,fluttershy,"Oh, no!"
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"Be cool. [to Ms. Peachbottom] Well, I know you're not expecting us, but we're here to personally welcome you to the Crystal Empire."
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,ms. peachbottom,Ms. The whole lot of you came to do that?
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"Uh, well, um... yes!"
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,ms. peachbottom,"Ms. Well, darn tootin', ain't that the cat's meow! Y'all didn't need to do that. Why, I hardly expected anything like this."
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,applejack,Whew! The Princess wouldn't have had it any other way.
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,ms. peachbottom,Ms. The Princess? Princess Cadance?
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,None other!
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,ms. peachbottom,"Ms. Well, tie me up and throw me down! This just keeps gettin' better and better!"
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,fluttershy,Can we help you with your bags?
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,ms. peachbottom,Ms. Don't mind if ya do!
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,fluttershy,"Ooh, I love flower print! Sorry."
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,"Our first stop is the castle, where we got a big razzamatazzy welcome planned for you!"
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,ms. peachbottom,Ms. The castle? Are you kidding?! Hot-diggety-dawg!
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,See that? We just gotta roll with it until the Princess gets there and we'll be just fine.
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,princess cadance,"So, uh... how's it going so far?"
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,rarity,"Oh, I'm so sorry... It's just... oh so complicated. [laughs nervously] I can fix it!"
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,princess cadance,Fix what?!
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,rarity,"Well, I-I was looking for shortcuts and I thought step twelve was optional! But it's not!"
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,ms. peachbottom,"Ms. My golly, the crystal castle! [gasps] Why, I've seen pictures, but I never expected to see it with my very own eyes! [gulps] From the inside..."
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,fluttershy,"Oh, my gosh, she's so nice!"
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,You're letting her lull you into a false sense of confidence. Watch that. It's all part of the game.
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,ms. peachbottom,"Ms. Oh, my, I'm so excited."
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"Please, have a seat, won't you?"
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,ms. peachbottom,Ms. Mind if I take a quick run outside first? It was an awfully long train ride and my legs could use a stretch.
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"Oh, well... we were just about to start."
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,ms. peachbottom,Ms. Oh! Never you mind. You go on ahead. I'm listening.
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,She was probably testing us to see if we could remain in control of a complex situation. Looks like we passed. Bump<U+0096>
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,fluttershy,<U+0096>cha!
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,We'd like to thank you for this opportunity to introduce you to this wonderful kingdom!
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,ms. peachbottom,"Ms. Oh, why, the pleasure is all mine."
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"And since we're not even from here ourselves, who better than us to let you know just how welcoming this place can be!"
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,ms. peachbottom,"Ms. Ooh, I tell ya! I have traveled far and wide, but I have never, ever been welcomed anyplace in the fashion that y'all have done here today."
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,That's fantastic! Princess Cadance would be so glad to hear that!
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,ms. peachbottom,"Ms. Honestly, I'm surprised she knows anything about me at all!"
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,Of course she does! She's been looking forward to your visit for weeks!
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,ms. peachbottom,"Ms. Oh, goody! Is she here?"
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,Uh...
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,applejack,[hushed] Where the heck is she anyway? Wasn't she supposed to be here by now?
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,"Or, if you like, we could give you a tour of the castle! That way you could be learning and stretching all at the same time!"
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,ms. peachbottom,"Ms. Ooh, a tour of the crystal castle... I'd love that a whole heap."
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,[hushed] Dash! We've hardly ever even been here before!
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,"[hushed] It's just another test! We gotta roll with it, remember?"
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,"Oooh! Lemme give the tour! I'lldoit, I'lldoit, letmeletmeletme!"
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"[breathes in] [breathes out] Fine. You all start giving her the tour, and I'll go see what's keeping Cadance."
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,Hello there!
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,rarity,[gasps] W-What are you doing here?
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,We finished the welcome committee song and we just wanted to introduce Ms. Harshwhinny to<U+0096>
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,rarity,"No, no! Princess Cadance isn't ready. Something's gone terribly wrong!"
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,I need to speak to the Princess.
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,rarity,You can't! You mustn't! She's in the middle of a delicate conditioning rinse that must go perfectly if there's to be any hope for her hair!
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"Come on, how bad can it be?"
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,rarity,Imagine her mane turned into a porcupine.
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,Ew.
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,rarity,"Please! I will bring her back from the brink of tragedy, but you have got to buy me some time! There's no other way!"
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,"So, you see this here? This, um, this is, um... a big, round room. It's known for its roundness and bigness. And did I mention that it's round?"
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,ms. peachbottom,"Ms. I think they call it a rotunda? A small, confining, rotunda..."
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,"[blows raspberry] Whatever. Round is round, am I right?"
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,applejack,"[hushed] Easy, Pinkie, let's play this safe! We got her in a good mood, so let's not do anything to ruin that."
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,ms. peachbottom,"Ms. You know... I love this sort of architecture. I-I-I detect a neo-Gothic inspiration in the design, yes?"
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,applejack,[sighs] And not a moment too soon. Where's Cadance? Please tell me she's right behind you.
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,There's a bit of a problem with her headdress. How's it going here?
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,ms. peachbottom,"Ms. I, uh, hate to be a bother, but the legs are cramping up on me with all this standing around..."
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,Huh?
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"She's getting bored, and we have to buy Rarity some more time. [breathes in] [breathes out] I'll see if Shining Armor can come help. Can't one of you other ponies take over in the meantime?"
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,"I got this. Wanna stretch your legs, huh? Well, whatever you need, I'm sure we can provide. Let's just make our way to the castle's gymnasium. Our tour will now be headed... this way. And we're walking, and we're walking..."
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,shining armor,Twily!
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"Hello there! Shining Armor, you've gotta help me."
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,shining armor,[blows whistle] Everything okay?
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,I left the other ponies behind giving the Games Inspector the worst castle tour ever.
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,shining armor,"Come on, gang! Are we gonna gallop, or are we gonna trot!? [to Twilight] Castle tour, huh? I'm pretty sure I can give you a hoof with that. [to athletes] Let's move, move, move! [to Twilight] Everything's gonna be okay."
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"I know, I'm not worried. I'm not worried... it worked!"
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,ms. peachbottom,Ms. [gasping] I'm outside! [laughing] Feels so good to stretch the old legs!
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,shining armor,"Uh, what the<U+0096>"
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,Turns out the crystal castle doesn't have a gymnasium.
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,shining armor,Watch it!
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,ms. peachbottom,Ms. Woo-hoo!
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,shining armor,Make her stop!
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,"Wait, that's the Games Inspector! Let her do her thing."
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,ms. peachbottom,"Ms. Good. Oh, these hooves! I'm outside!"
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,shining armor,Why would she do that?
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,"I have no idea, but that's why she's who's in charge of choosing who gets the Games, and we're not."
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,ms. peachbottom,"Ms. [muffled] Oh! Oh, get me outside for a run!"
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,shining armor,Look out!
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,"Yeah, okay, we need to stop her."
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,fluttershy,Where's she going in such a hurry?
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,Closer... closer... I think we've got her... Yaaaaaaah!
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,ms. peachbottom,"Ms. Hoo-eee! Oh, that felt good! Nothing like a great run to shake the cobwebs off these old bones."
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,ms. peachbottom,"Ms. Hey there, speedy. Ah, these wide open spaces y'all got here remind me of home. This is great!"
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,ms. peachbottom,"Ms. Oh, good golly, yes. I just love to travel and see new places. Such a beautiful spot you got here, too!"
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,shining armor,Why... thank you so much! I'm Shining Armor.
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,ms. peachbottom,Ms. [gasps] The Prince!
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,What's going on?
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,"From the looks of it, just locking up the games for the Crystal Empire is all. Ain't no thing."
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,ms. peachbottom,"Ms. My, oh, my... I never met a Prince before..."
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,shining armor,[chuckles] I'm surprised. I'd think in your line of work you'd meet princes all the time.
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"You... are Ms. Harshwhinny, the Equestria Games Inspector, aren't you?"
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,ms. peachbottom,Ms. Inspector what-now?
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,We got the wrong pony?!
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,"NOOOOOOOOOOO! I mean, YEEEEEEESSSSSSSS!"
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,applejack,"Oh, please still be here... Oh please, oh please, oh please..."
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,There's got to be another pony with flower print luggage around here somewhere.
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,Except that there isn't!
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,We've gotta find her before Cadance finds out what a mess we've made of things.
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,"Okay, here's what we do. We split the Empire up into five sectors."
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,fluttershy,Each of us search a sector.
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,"Well... except for the spa. What's the point of checking there? That's where Cadance is. If Ms. Harshwhinny is there, well, then, game over, right?"
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,ms. peachbottom,"Ms. Oh, golly, I've been having a swell time since I got here. I'm actually thinking of extendin' my stay."
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,ms. peachbottom,"Ms. Oohohohoooh, gosh, where to start?"
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,"Oh, there she is! We're in luck! I don't think either of them knows yet that the other one's here!"
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,rarity,"Wonderful news, look! Princess Cadance, better than new!"
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,princess cadance,I-I can't believe it... What was wrong with your welcome?
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,princess cadance,What is going on?
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,"Princess, we gave our welcome to the wrong pony, left the right one waiting at the station, and completely ruined everything."
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,"When I was a little filly, I wanted so badly for Cloudsdale to win the Equestria Games. But it didn't happen. So I thought I could make up for that disappointment by helping the Crystal Empire win the chance to host the Games. But it looks like I ruined your chances instead."
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,ms. peachbottom,"Ms. Not so fast, speedy."
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,ms. peachbottom,Ms. Darn tootin'!
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,princess cadance,[through microphone] The next host of the Equestria Games is... the Crystal Empire!
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,We did it!
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,princess cadance,"[through microphone] Congratulations, Crystal Ponies!"
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,"[sighs] You know, it feels good to help others get something you always wanted but never had. Almost as good as getting it yourself. Almost."
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,We'll still be able to come back here and watch the games when they're played.
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,You're right. That'll rock!
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,fluttershy,"Oh, my goodness."
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,"Huh, bummer Spike had to miss out on all this. He woulda' had fun here."
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,I'm sure he's having a great time watching all the critters back at home.
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,applejack,Think he's still got a handle on things?
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"[breathes out] If he's staying calm and collected, I bet he's doing a terrific job as a leader."
Games Ponies Play,Dave Polsky,applejack,You all hear that?
Magical Mystery Cure,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,Morning in Ponyville shimmers Morning in Ponyville shines And I know for absolute certain That everything is certainly fine
Magical Mystery Cure,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,My Ponyville is so gentle and still Can things ever go wrong? I don't think that they will
Magical Mystery Cure,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Rainbow Dash, that's not funny!"
Magical Mystery Cure,M. A. Larson,rarity,"Terribly sorry, darling. I'm afraid I'm... I'm not good with the thundery ones."
Magical Mystery Cure,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,[gasp] Something tells me everything is not going to be fine.
Magical Mystery Cure,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,What are you doing? What happened to your cutie mark?
Magical Mystery Cure,M. A. Larson,rarity,"Whatever do you mean, Twilight? I'm simply doing what I've done since the day it first appeared. Does my sky look fabulous or what?"
Magical Mystery Cure,M. A. Larson,rarity,Too last season?
Magical Mystery Cure,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,Where is Rainbow Dash? Why isn't she handling this?
Magical Mystery Cure,M. A. Larson,spike,[yawns] I still don't know what you had to wake me up for. I love sleeping in the rain.
Magical Mystery Cure,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,"Hey, guys."
Magical Mystery Cure,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,Rainbow Dash! Why is Rarity doing your job?
Magical Mystery Cure,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,And what in Equestria is going on in... here?
Magical Mystery Cure,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,"These animals don't listen, no, not one little bit They run around out of control and throw their hissy fits [cat hissing] It's up to me to stop them, 'cause plainly you can see It's got to be my destiny, and it's what my cutie mark is telling me"
Magical Mystery Cure,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,"[blows balloon] I try to keep them laughing, put a smile upon their face But no matter what I try, it seems a bit of a disgrace [blows party horn] [laughter] I have to entertain them, it's there for all to see It's got to be my destiny, and it's what my cutie mark is telling me"
Magical Mystery Cure,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,"I don't care much for pickin' fruit and plowin' fields ain't such a hoot No matter what I try, I cannot fix this busted water chute! I've got so many chores to do, it's no fun being me But it has to be my destiny, 'cause it's what my cutie mark is telling me"
Magical Mystery Cure,M. A. Larson,applejack,"Lookie here at what I made, I think that it's a dress I know it doesn't look like much, I'm under some distress Could y'all give me a hand here and help me fix this mess? My destiny is not pretty, but it's what my cutie mark is tellin' me"
Magical Mystery Cure,M. A. Larson,rarity,"I'm in love with weather patterns, but the others have concerns For I just gave them frostbite over top of their sunburns I have to keep on trying, for everyone can see"
Magical Mystery Cure,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,It's got to be
Magical Mystery Cure,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,My destiny
Magical Mystery Cure,M. A. Larson,applejack,My destiny
Magical Mystery Cure,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"This is bad. This is very, very bad."
Magical Mystery Cure,M. A. Larson,spike,What's going on? Why is this happening?!
Magical Mystery Cure,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Last night when you were taking one of your seven-hour bubble baths, I got a special delivery from the princess."
Magical Mystery Cure,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Dear Twilight Sparkle,"
Magical Mystery Cure,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"I cast the spell so I could find out what it was, but nothing seemed to happen. But now I know something did happen. The spell has changed the Elements of Harmony! That must be why their cutie marks are all wrong!"
Magical Mystery Cure,M. A. Larson,spike,So just cast a counter-spell to switch them back.
Magical Mystery Cure,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,Oh. There is no counter-spell!
Magical Mystery Cure,M. A. Larson,spike,Why don't you just use that memory spell you used to fix everypony when Discord was here?
Magical Mystery Cure,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"It's not their memories, Spike. It's their true selves that have been altered!"
Magical Mystery Cure,M. A. Larson,spike,Zecora's cure for the cutie pox?
Magical Mystery Cure,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,That won't work either...
Magical Mystery Cure,M. A. Larson,spike,"Well [sighs], maybe it won't be so bad. Maybe our friends will grow to like their new lives."
Magical Mystery Cure,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"No, Spike. They're not who they are meant to be anymore. Their destinies are now changed, and it's all my fault."
Magical Mystery Cure,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,I have to find a way To make this all okay I can't believe this small mistake Could've caused so much heartache
Magical Mystery Cure,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Oh, Spike, what have I done?"
Magical Mystery Cure,M. A. Larson,spike,"Aw, come on, Twilight, you'll figure out a way to fix this. These are your friends."
Magical Mystery Cure,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"You're right, Spike. And they mean more to me than anything. My friends..."
Magical Mystery Cure,M. A. Larson,spike,Twilight? Are you alright?
Magical Mystery Cure,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,I've got it! I know what to do!
Magical Mystery Cure,M. A. Larson,spike,You do?
Magical Mystery Cure,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"I may not be able to remind them of who they are, but I can show them what they mean to each other. They'll find the part of themselves that's been lost so they can help the friend they care about so much! Come on, Spike!"
Magical Mystery Cure,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Fluttershy, wait!"
Magical Mystery Cure,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,"Oh... Hey, Twilight..."
Magical Mystery Cure,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,Where are you going?
Magical Mystery Cure,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,"I'm moving back to Cloudsdale. I don't know what's wrong, but I can't seem to make anypony laugh."
Magical Mystery Cure,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Before you go, I was wondering if you might be willing to help Rainbow Dash. She's really struggling with her animals."
Magical Mystery Cure,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,But... I don't really know anything about animals...
Magical Mystery Cure,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,But you do know something about Rainbow Dash.
Magical Mystery Cure,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,"I... know that she's a true friend, and I'll do anything I can to help her."
Magical Mystery Cure,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,[muffled] Whoa!
Magical Mystery Cure,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,Rainbow Dash!
Magical Mystery Cure,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,I'm in here! Help! I'm trapped!
Magical Mystery Cure,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,"Hurry, Twilight! Can't you do some sort of spell to get her out?"
Magical Mystery Cure,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"No. Fluttershy, you're the only one who can help! Rainbow Dash needs you!"
Magical Mystery Cure,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,"Um... Hello? Little... woodland creatures? I know that you're all very upset and feel like giving Rainbow Dash a hard time, but we'd all really appreciate it if you'd calm down and, um, maybe... rest for a bit? Oh! Uh... look! Here's some nice, juicy leaves for you to munch on. And some crunchy, munchy acorns too. Uh, wouldn't you like to take a break and have a little snack?"
Magical Mystery Cure,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,"Aww, look at that. I guess you were all just cranky because you were hungry. Oh, you are very welcome, little friends."
Magical Mystery Cure,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,"Goodness, it's like I can understand them! I... I feel strange, like... like this is what I'm meant to do, like this is who I am! My destiny! Wha... what happened?"
Magical Mystery Cure,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Fluttershy, look! Your cutie mark!"
Magical Mystery Cure,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"It worked! It worked! Oh, I'm so happy you're back to normal! Now we need your help!"
Magical Mystery Cure,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,"Um, hello? Friend trapped inside, remember?"
Magical Mystery Cure,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Rarity needs your help She's trying hard, doing what she can"
Magical Mystery Cure,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,"Would you try, just give it a chance You might find that you'll start to understand"
Magical Mystery Cure,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,"Uh, what just happened?"
Magical Mystery Cure,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"There's no time to explain, but we need your help. Applejack's trying to make dresses!"
Magical Mystery Cure,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,Say no more!
Magical Mystery Cure,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,"Applejack needs your help She's trying hard, doing what she can Would you try, just give it a chance You might find that you'll start to understand"
Magical Mystery Cure,M. A. Larson,rarity,"[gasps] Oh my, what a terrible dream I had. Or, maybe I'm still having it."
Magical Mystery Cure,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Rarity, Pinkie Pie is about to lose the apple farm. We need Applejack's help!"
Magical Mystery Cure,M. A. Larson,rarity,"Lose the apple farm? Well we can't let that happen, now can we?"
Magical Mystery Cure,M. A. Larson,rarity,Pinkie Pie is in trouble We need to get there by her side We can try to do what we can now For together we can be her guide
Magical Mystery Cure,M. A. Larson,applejack,Yee-haw! Now that's more like it! What's next?
Magical Mystery Cure,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,The townspeople are furious. We need the old Pinkie Pie back.
Magical Mystery Cure,M. A. Larson,applejack,I'm on it. I know just the thing.
Magical Mystery Cure,M. A. Larson,applejack,"The townspeople need you They've been sad for a while They march around, face a-frown And never seem to smile And if you feel like helpin' We'd appreciate a lot If you'd get up there and spread some cheer From here to Canterlot"
Magical Mystery Cure,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,"Come on ponies, I wanna see you SMILE!"
Magical Mystery Cure,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"[echoing] A mark of one's destiny, singled out alone, fulfilled. [normal] [gasps] Wait a second, that's it! I understand now! I know how to fix the spell!"
Magical Mystery Cure,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,[gasps] What happened?
Magical Mystery Cure,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,[echoing] Hello? Where am I? What is this place?
Magical Mystery Cure,M. A. Larson,princess celestia,"[echoing] Congratulations, Twilight. I knew you could do it."
Magical Mystery Cure,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,[echoing] Princess... I don't understand. What did I do?
Magical Mystery Cure,M. A. Larson,princess celestia,"You did something today that's never been done before. Something even a great unicorn like Star Swirl the Bearded was not able to do, because he did not understand friendship like you do. The lessons you've learned here in Ponyville have taught you well. You have proven that you're ready, Twilight."
Magical Mystery Cure,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,Ready? Ready for what?
Magical Mystery Cure,M. A. Larson,princess celestia,"You've come such a long, long way And I've watched you from that very first day To see how you might grow To see what you might do To see what you've been through And all the ways you've made me proud of you"
Magical Mystery Cure,M. A. Larson,applejack,Twilight? Is that you?
Magical Mystery Cure,M. A. Larson,applejack,Wha... I-I've never seen anything like it!
Magical Mystery Cure,M. A. Larson,rarity,"Why, you've become an Alicorn. I didn't even know that was possible."
Magical Mystery Cure,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,Wow... You look just like a princess!
Magical Mystery Cure,M. A. Larson,princess celestia,That's because she is a princess.
Magical Mystery Cure,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,A... A princess?
Magical Mystery Cure,M. A. Larson,princess celestia,"Since you've come to Ponyville, you've displayed the charity, compassion, devotion, integrity, optimism, and of course, the leadership of a true princess."
Magical Mystery Cure,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,But... does this mean I won't be your student anymore?
Magical Mystery Cure,M. A. Larson,princess celestia,"Not in the same way as before. I'll still be here to help and guide you, but we're all your students now, too. You are an inspiration to us all, Twilight."
Magical Mystery Cure,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,But... what do I do now? Is there a book about being a princess I should read?
Magical Mystery Cure,M. A. Larson,princess celestia,[giggles] There will be time for all of that later.
Magical Mystery Cure,M. A. Larson,princess celestia,"We are gathered here today in celebration of a momentous occasion. My most faithful student, Twilight Sparkle, has done many extraordinary things since she's lived in Ponyville. She even helped reunite me with my sister, Princess Luna. But today, Twilight Sparkle did something extraordinary. She created new magic, proving without a doubt that she is ready to be crowned Equestria's newest princess. Fillies and gentlecolts, may I present for the very first time, Princess Twilight Sparkle!"
Magical Mystery Cure,M. A. Larson,princess celestia,"Say something, Princess."
Magical Mystery Cure,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Oh. Um... [clears throat] A little while ago, my teacher and mentor Princess Celestia sent me to live in Ponyville. She sent me to study friendship, which is something I didn't really care much about. But now, on a day like today, I can honestly say I wouldn't be standing here if it weren't for the friendships I've made with all of you. Each one of you taught me something about friendship, and for that, I will always be grateful. Today, I consider myself the luckiest pony in Equestria. Thank you, friends. Thank you, everypony!"
Magical Mystery Cure,M. A. Larson,shining armor,Twilight! I'm so proud of you!
Magical Mystery Cure,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,Are you crying?
Magical Mystery Cure,M. A. Larson,shining armor,Of course not. It's... it's liquid pride. Totally different thing.
Magical Mystery Cure,M. A. Larson,applejack,"Way to go, Princess!"
Magical Mystery Cure,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,Best coronation day ever!
Magical Mystery Cure,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,"We love you, Twilight."
Magical Mystery Cure,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"I love you too, girls!"
Magical Mystery Cure,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,Life in Equestria shimmers Life in Equestria shines And I know for absolute certain
Magical Mystery Cure,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,Yes! Everything<U+0092>s going to be just fine!
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,You gotta really flap 'em hard.
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,[grunts] Whoa!
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,"Uh, maybe not quite that hard."
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Whoa! Oof!
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,applejack,"Lookin' good up there, Princess Twilight."
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"Applejack, you know you don't have to call me that."
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,Why do you protest so? You've already given up wearing your crown all the time. The least you can do is embrace your new title.
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"If other ponies want to address me that way, I suppose it's fine, but... not my friends. It just doesn't feel right. [sigh] And neither does all this flying business. The Summer Sun Celebration is only two days away, and I'm never gonna be ready to perform my part."
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,"Not if you spend all your time down here, you won't! Now get up there and show everypony the big finish!"
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,Wow! That was a big finish!
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"You look amazing, darling. They've really captured your regality."
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,I suppose.
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,I don't know if it's everypony's dream.
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,Most of my dreams are about frosting! [slurp] Ohohohoho...
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,We'd better get going. We don't want to miss our train.
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,applejack,"Fluttershy's right. Don't know about y'all, but I've still got bushels to do to get ready. The official celebration may be here in Canterlot, but hoo-wee, has the Mayor put us in charge of one heck of a party back home. Aw, don't look like that, sugarcube. You get to be right there with the other Princesses when Celestia raises the sun."
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"And I'm honored. Really, I am. It's just that the Summer Sun Celebration is what first brought us all together. It just doesn't feel right not getting to spend such a special day with my Ponyville friends."
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"It doesn't feel right to us either, darling. If the Mayor wasn't so desperate for our assistance, we'd most certainly stay here in Canterlot. And of course we do understand that your royal duties must come first."
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,applejack,"The Summer Sun Celebration may have brought us together, but it's something much bigger that'll always keep us connected. Exhibit A: The six of us are united by the Elements of Harmony. No amount of royal duties is gonna change that. Right, everypony?"
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,applejack,"Right, Pinkie Pie?"
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,You should take that as a yes.
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,"We're gonna write you and give you so many details, it'll be like you're in Ponyville with us! Right, girls?"
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,And you will be with us right after the Celebration. We already have an appointment on the books to discuss the royal upgrades to your loft decor.
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,Whee!
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"[exhales] I can't help it, Spike. They've only been gone a minute, and I already feel like I'm missing something."
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,spike,"[reading] Dear Twilight, you aren't missing anything. Your friend, Pinkie Pie."
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,[in the distance] That's me!
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,But I am. I just know it.
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,spike,"Check, check, check, check, and... check! Huh, whaddaya know? We're way ahead of schedule! I credit your extremely competent assistant."
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,So do I.
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,spike,The Celebration isn't until the day after tomorrow. We could still fit in a quick trip to Ponyville and be back in plenty of time to finish off these last few things before the main event!
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"[sighs] That would be nice, Spike, but what if something else came up while we were gone? What if we were delayed getting back and I wasn't able to finish everything on that list? What if we lost the list on the way to Ponyville and then couldn't remember which things we'd done and which things we hadn't done, and then spent so much time trying to figure out what we hadn't done and what we had done, and we ruined the entire Celebration by not doing the one really important thing that we were supposed to do?!"
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,spike,Uh... so that's a 'no' then?
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,These are the first royal duties Princess Celestia has given me. I can't risk letting her down!
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,princess celestia,And I'm sure you won't.
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,spike,Your highness!
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,princess celestia,"No need for that now, Princess Twilight."
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Sorry.
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,princess celestia,[giggles] No need to apologize.
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Sorry!
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,princess celestia,I must admit that it is wonderful to actually be looking forward to the Summer Sun Celebration.
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,What do you mean?
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,princess celestia,"For my subjects, it has always been a celebration of my defeat of Nightmare Moon. But for me... [sighs] It was just a terrible reminder that I'd had to banish my own sister."
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,I guess I never really thought about it that way.
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,princess celestia,"But now it has become a wonderful reminder of her transformation back into Princess Luna, and our happy reunion. I am so pleased that you will be playing a role in the festivities. I know it must have been difficult to see your friends return to Ponyville without you."
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Maybe a little.
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,princess celestia,"You may no longer be my student, Princess Twilight, but I hope you know that I will always be here if you need me. Just as I hope that you will always be there when I need you."
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,spike,[clears throat] I think this guy needs you?
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,princess celestia,"A letter from Ponyville, I presume?"
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"Never mind. It's not important. Spike, where were we?"
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,spike,About to call it a night?
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,We should probably go over the checklist one more time.
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,spike,I knew you were gonna say that...
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,princess celestia,I'll leave you to it.
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Huh?! Spike?
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,spike,[snores] Check-check-check-check-check-check...
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Spike!
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,spike,Ungh... What time is it?
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,It's the middle of the night! But it could be morning. That's just it! I can't tell!
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,spike,Whoa. That is weird.
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"Come on, Spike, we have to find out what's going on."
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"I'm-I'm sure it's just... Well, there's certainly a logical ex<U+0096>"
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,But I don't understand! Where are they?
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,spike,Vanished?!
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,My command?!
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,spike,"Way to take charge, Twilight."
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,"Excuse me... Oh, pardon me... Are you all right? My goodness, what is it that has caused you all such distress?"
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,"Whatever it is, I'm sure it's nothing you need to really worry about. [screams] Oh, no, you were right. You should be worried! Very, very worried!"
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,big mcintosh,...Nope.
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,applejack,"[straining] Dagnabbit, we ain't never seen this kind of trouble with weeds before. Now that I think about it, I've never seen these kinds of weeds at all! Have y'all?"
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,big mcintosh,Nope.
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,applejack,Where the heck are these things comin' from? And what in tarnation is goin' on with the sky?!
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,"Oh, no, you don't! This is Ponyville territory, and we aren't due for rain until after the Summer Sun Celebration. You Everfree clouds need to just head on back to where you belong! Whoa! [yelps] Gonna make me do this the hard way, huh? [yelping] Hey!"
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,[humming] Hmm. Something strange about the sky.
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,What in the name of calming chamomile is going on?!
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"Opalescence, darling, I'm so sorry! I promise I am not doing this on purpose!"
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"It wasn't me, I swear!"
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"Ooh, Sweetie Belle! If this is some sort of prank you and your little Crusader friends are pulling, I find very little humor in it!"
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,sweetie belle,"Rarity, you have to help me! I think something's wrong with my horn!"
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,spike,Where are we going?!
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"The Everfree Forest is... 'invading'. Whatever is going on, I'm sure we're going to need our friends and the Elements of Harmony to stop it! I just hope we haven't missed the train..."
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,spike,"[gasps] [short on breath] Twilight? There is another way for us to get to Ponyville, remember?"
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,There is?
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,spike,Huah! You can fly!
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Oh. Right!
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Whoa!
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"Something very strange is going on, and- [gasps] I for one would appreciate an explanation!"
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,"All I know is the sky's split in two, and these clouds moving in sure aren't from around here."
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,applejack,"Neither are all these crazy plants! They're comin' from the Everfree Forest! And try as we might, us Earth ponies can't do anythin' to get rid of 'em! Don't suppose you know any magic that might stop 'em from spreadin'?"
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"Alas, this whole raging forest situation seems to have left my horn on the fritz!"
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,We have to figure out something! I don't know how much more of this Ponyville can take! [yelps] I don't know how much more I can take!
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,applejack,"The forest is expandin', y'all, and judgin' by how fast it's movin', it doesn't seem content just takin' over Ponyville... I reckon before long, it'll cover half of Equestria!"
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,spike,I'm starting to wish... we'd taken the train!
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"Almost there! Come on, Spike, we need to get the Elements of Harmony and find the others!"
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,spike,Incoming!
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Whoa! Aah!
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"Oh, thank goodness!"
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,"Oh, I hope you know we wouldn't normally go through your books without permission..."
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,spike,"Sweet ground! [kissing noises] Sweet, sweet, wonderful ground!"
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"Okay, I get it! I need to work on my flying!"
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,"I dunno if you've noticed, but the Everfree Forest is just a teeny-tiny bit out of control."
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,applejack,Guess it turned out you were missin' something here in Ponyville after all.
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,But perhaps you already know what's causing all of this calamity. Has Princess Celestia sent you to dispel it posthaste?
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"Not exactly. You see, Princess Celestia is, well... she and Princess Luna are both..."
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,spike,They're missing!
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"I don't know who has taken them, but I've got a hunch we're going to need the Elements of Harmony to get them back."
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,"Oh, yeah, just like old times."
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,A-boo-yah!
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,applejack,I told ya we'd always be connected by the Elements. [sighs] Now we just gotta figure out who to aim these bad boys at so we can get Celestia and Luna back and keep the rest of Equestria from becoming plant food! Any ideas?
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Hmm...
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,I haven't found squat in any of the books I've been looking through! Oopsies! Missed a spot!
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"Half day, half night... strange weather patterns... out of control plants. I think I'm starting to get a pretty good idea of who we're up against."
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,discord,"[singing] Winter Wrap Up, Winter Wrap-ooh! [laughs] Now, Twilight, you know Princess Celestia said that you were to give me a heads up before you summon me with that little spell she gave you. In case you haven't noticed, I was in the middle of a particularly invigorating shower."
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"E-nough! Release Princess Celestia and Princess Luna, and stop the Everfree Forest from invading!"
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,discord,"Why, [chuckles] whatever are you talking about?"
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,applejack,"Don't you play dumb with us, Discord! We know you're the one behind all of this!"
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,discord,"Don't get me wrong. I absolutely love what you've done with the place, but I couldn't possibly take responsibility. I'm reformed, don't you remember?"
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,"Yeah, right! This has got your cloven hoofprints all over it!"
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,discord,I'll have you know that I have only one cloven hoof. Such accusations. And here I thought we were friends.
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,"Drop the act, buster! We're onto you!"
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,discord,"Ladies, ladies, I'm innocent. Would I lie to you?"
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,"Um, maybe?"
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,discord,"Well then, it seems we've reached an impasse. I'm telling the truth, but you think I'm lying. What do friends like us do in a situation like this, Princess Twilight? Congrats, by the way, on the promotion. You totally deserve it."
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,I say we blast him back to stone!
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,applejack,Works for me!
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"Hear, hear!"
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,Hey! We can't do that! What if he really is telling the truth?
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,discord,"Well, finally! Somepony willing to give me the benefit of the doubt. The rest of you could learn a lot about friendship from my dear friend Shutterfly here."
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,"Um, it's Fluttershy."
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,discord,"Oh, right, whatever."
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"If you're not the one responsible, then help us figure out who is!"
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,discord,"I suppose I could, but after all the hoof pointing and besmirching of my good name, I just don't know if I'm up to it."
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Rrrgh!
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,discord,Why don't you ask your zebra friend if she knows anything?
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Zecora!
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,zecora,"From my home, I have had to flee! The forest has grown too wild, even for me!"
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,applejack,Any idea why all this is happenin'?
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,zecora,"I'm afraid it is a mystery to me as well, but I may have something that, if combined with a spell... I do not dare to use it myself, the results would be tragic. It only responds to Alicorn magic. Princess Twilight, you can turn the potion from purple to white. After a sip, you may see why the sky is day and night."
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,Oooh!
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,[drinking] Doesn't seem to be worki-
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Where am I?
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,princess luna,Not... another step!
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Princess Luna! I don't understand. Where are we? Why did you and Celestia disappear?
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,princess luna,Did you really expect me to sit idly by while they all basked in your precious light?
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Precious light?
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,princess luna,There can only be one princess in Equestria! And that princess... will be me!
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,spike,They're missing!
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,The Everfree Forest is... invading. I think I'm starting to get a pretty good idea of who we're up against.
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,discord,I'm reformed. Don't you remember? Why don't you ask your zebra friend?
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,zecora,You can turn the potion from purple to white. You may see why the sky is day and night.
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Princess Luna!
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,princess luna,There can only be one princess in Equestria! And that princess will be me!
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Luna! Think of how long you were banished to the moon! You'll give us no choice but to send you back there if you don't stop!
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,princess celestia,"Luna, I will not fight you! You must lower the moon! It is your duty!"
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,nightmare moon,Luna? I am... Nightmare Moon! I have but one royal duty now: to destroy you! And where do you think you're going?
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Celestia!
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,No... Why would Luna do this? Why now? [crying] You're all right. You're all right! Princess Celestia?
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,princess celestia,"Oh, dear sister. I am sorry, but you have given me no choice but to use these."
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Are those the Elements of Harmony? But that's how they looked in... the past. This is the night you banished her.
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,nightmare moon,Nooooooo!
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Why are you all looking at me like that?
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,applejack,It's just... you were mumblin' to yourself...
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,Ooh! And don't forget the uncontrollable sobbing!
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,We were really worried about you.
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,discord,"I for one found it delightful. Sort of a one-pony theater piece, if you will. You should really consider taking it on the road."
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,Did you find out whose rump we need to kick and where we can find them?
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,I saw something from a long time ago. But it didn't explain what's happening now.
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,zecora,Perhaps farther back still are the answers you seek. Another sip of the potion will give you a peek.
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,spike,You sure about this?
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,discord,"Oh, I do hope she breaks into a song this time!"
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,discord,"Oh, this is so much fun. How about a game of 'Pin the Tail on the Pony'?"
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,princess celestia,"[gasp] Play time is over for you, Discord."
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,discord,"Oh, I doubt that. [munching] Hungry? Suit yourselves. Oh! What have you got there?"
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,princess celestia,The Elements of Harmony.
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,princess luna,"With them, we shall defeat you."
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,This must be when they turned Discord into stone.
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,discord,[laughing] You should see yourselves right now. The expressions on your face. So intense. So sure of yourselves. [laughing] Hilarious!
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,princess luna,[gasp] The Tree of Harmony.
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,The Tree of Harmony? My cutie mark.
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,princess luna,Are you sure?
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,princess celestia,"We have managed to discover the only means by which we can defeat Discord and free the citizens of Equestria. Even without these elements, the Tree of Harmony will possess a powerful magic. As long as that magic remains, it will continue to control and contain all that grows here."
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,spike,So what did you find out?
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"I still don't know what's happened to Princess Luna and Princess Celestia, but I think I know why the Everfree Forest is acting this way. Something's happened to the Tree of Harmony."
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,The tree of what now?
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,It's where Princess Celestia and Princess Luna found the Elements. I think it's in danger.
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,applejack,"Well, all right then! Let's go save a... tree. Uh... where is it exactly?"
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,I think it's in... there.
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,discord,Ooh-hoo! I'm going to need more popcorn!
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,Seems like only yesterday we were heading into these woods to find the Elements of Harmony.
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"Seems like only yesterday I was foolish enough to think I should go after them on my own. I don't know what we're going to face in there. But whatever it is, I know we need to face it together."
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,[gasps] A cragadile! Run for your lives!
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,That was close.
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,applejack,"[sighs] A little too close, if you ask me. You sure you're all right?"
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,I'm fine. I just can't seem to get these new wings to do what I want them to do when I want them to do it.
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,"Aw, you'll figure it out eventually."
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"""Eventually"" isn't soon enough."
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,applejack,"You have been having an awful lot of trouble with those things. And, well, who knows what else is gonna to come after us? You know, maybe it wouldn't be such a bad idea for Twilight to go back to Ponyville and let us look for the Tree of Harmony without her."
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,What? Why?
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,applejack,"For starters, you just about got eaten by a cragadilly."
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,We all did. He wasn't after just me.
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,applejack,"Sure, but... well, the rest of us aren't princesses."
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,What's that got to do with anything?
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,applejack,"Princess Celestia and Princess Luna are gone. If something happened to you, I-I just don't think Equestria can risk losing another princess."
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"Applejack does make a valid point. Even if we manage to save the Tree of Harmony, it won't necessarily mean Princess Celestia and Princess Luna will return. Equestria will need somepony to lead in their absence."
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,But the Tree of Harmony! I'm the only one who has seen it and knows what it looks like.
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,"Huge tree, cutie marks on the trunk, probably being attacked by something hideously awful? Yeah, I'm pretty sure we'll know it when we see it."
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,All of you feel this way? Feel like I shouldn't be here?
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,It is probably for the best.
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Discord!
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,discord,You're welcome! Hmph. No luck finding your tree?
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,We ran into some trouble. And my friends decided it would be best if I returned to Ponyville while they continue the search. Equestria will need me if Princess Celestia and Princess Luna don't return.
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,discord,I'm just surprised that you agreed to their plan. I never thought you'd be the kind of pony who would think she was better than everypony else.
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,I don't think I'm better than anypony!
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,I never should have agreed to come back here.
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,spike,"Come on, Twilight. Discord may be reformed, but he's not that reformed. He's just trying to get under your skin."
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"Well, it's working!"
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,Anypony else starting to think this is a lost cause? We're almost at Celestia and Luna's old castle. Maybe whatever Twilight saw when she took that crazy potion wasn't real. Maybe there is no Tree of Harmony. Maybe<U+0096>
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,applejack,Maybe it's right down there.
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,[gasp] It can't be!
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,How are we supposed to get to it?
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,"Whoa! Oof! Ugh! Take the stairs, silly!"
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,spike,Are we there yet?
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,I don't know where we are. We're lost. I never should have left my friends.
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,spike,"We can't just give up. Maybe if I get up there, I'll be able to spot 'em. Well, what do you know? Twilight?"
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,[gasp] I think it's dying!
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,Nice try. Heh- Whoa! Oof!
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"Valiant efforts on both your parts, but the tree remains in jeopardy."
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,applejack,And I suppose you've got a better idea? That's what I thought.
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,I know who would know what to do. But we sent her home.
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,"It was your idea, Applejack!"
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,applejack,"We all agreed it was the best thing, Rainbow Dash! We were tryin' to protect her."
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,spike,Oof! Ow! Ugh!
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,spike,Twilight! Trouble! Help!
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,applejack,"Listen here, you rabid rhododendrons! You mess with one of us, you mess with all of us!"
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,Up here!
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,Yoo-hoo! Come and get me!
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,Don't forget about me!
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,Ta-da!
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,applejack,I sure am glad you came looking for us.
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Not as glad as I am that you found me.
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"The truth of it is, Twilight, we're simply lost without you."
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,Yeah. Equestria may need its princess...
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,... But we need our friend.
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,princess celestia,"[voice over] Even without these elements, the Tree of Harmony will possess a powerful magic. As long as that magic remains, it will continue to control and contain all that grows here."
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,I know how we can save the tree. We have to give it the Elements of Harmony.
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, heh. How are we supposed to protect Equestria?"
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,How are we meant to rein Discord in if we can't use the Elements to turn him back to stone?
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,applejack,Twilight... The Elements of Harmony... They're what keep us connected no matter what.
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"You're right about one thing, Applejack. The Elements of Harmony did bring us together. But it isn't the Elements that will keep us connected. It's our friendship. And it's more important and more powerful than any magic. My new role in Equestria may mean I have to take on new responsibilities, and our friendships may be tested, but it will never, ever be broken. There's no time to lose. Everypony ready?"
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,discord,"[thud] Oh, poo."
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,princess celestia,We know how difficult it must have been for you to give up the Elements. It took great courage to relinquish them.
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,What's inside it? How am I supposed to open it?
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,princess luna,"Six locks, six keys."
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,princess celestia,I do not know where they are. But I do know that it is a mystery you will not be solving alone.
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,discord,"Bravo, ladies, bravo! How ever did you save the day this time? Blast the beastie with your magic necklaces, I presume? Where are those little trinkets of yours? You know, the ones you use to send me back to my extremely uncomfortable stone prison?"
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,applejack,[sigh] Gone.
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,discord,Gone? Gone?
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,"But our friendship remains. And if you want to remain friends, you'll stop thinking whatever it is you're thinking and help us clean up."
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,discord,Fine. But I don't do windows.
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,applejack,One thing I don't get. Why did all this happen now?
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,discord,I have no idea. Those seeds I planted should have sprouted up ages ago.
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,What did you say?!
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,discord,"Oh, why should I try to explain it when you can see for yourself?"
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,princess celestia,"Play time is over for you, Discord!"
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,discord,"Oh, I doubt that. [munching] Hungry? [voice over] Well, obviously things didn't go according to my original plan. My plunderseeds should have stolen the magic from the Tree of Harmony and captured Princess Celestia and Princess Luna thousands of moons ago. Alas, it seems the tree had enough magic to keep the seeds from growing up big and strong. Until now, that is."
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,You realize this is information we could have used hours ago?!
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,discord,And rob you of a valuable lesson about being princess? What kind of friend do you think I am?
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,princess celestia,"Citizens of Equestria, it is no longer with a heavy heart but with great joy that I raise the summer sun. For this celebration now represents not the defeat of Nightmare Moon, but the return of my sister, Princess Luna."
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,spike,"What's wrong, Twilight?"
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"Ugh, I've gone through every book in Ponyville, Spike, and there isn't a single mention of the mysterious chest that came from the Tree of Harmony, nor anything about keys to unlock it! But something tells me that opening it is pretty important. I hope Princess Celestia has some ideas. If the library in Canterlot doesn't have anything, I-I don't know where else to look!"
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"[reading] My dearest Twilight, while it would be perfectly lovely to have you in Canterlot once more, I have another option in mind much closer to Ponyville."
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,princess celestia,"[voice over] As you know, the ancient castle that I once shared with Princess Luna lies mostly in ruins, deep in the Everfree Forest. But if you look carefully, you may find a book that could prove helpful to your research, hidden somewhere in what's left of the castle library."
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,[happy gasp] Wow! Look at all these ancient books! It's a veritable goldmine of information! I can't believe it! Woo-hoo!
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,spike,"Whoa, whoa-whoa! Oof! [yelp] Uh, heh-heh. So, uh, Twilight. Uh, ready to head home?"
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,Are you kidding? This place is perfect!
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,rainbow dash,I'm not gonna move. You move.
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,applejack,Uh-uh. There is no way I'm movin'.
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,pinkie pie,This is the most daring dare anypony ever dared dare another pony to dare!
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,pinkie pie,It's exciting!
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,pinkie pie,"Rainbow Dash and Applejack are competing for the title of ""Most Daring Pony""! This is the final test: the Bee Stare! Last pony to blink wins!"
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,rainbow dash,But then we'll never find out who the Most Daring Pony is!
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,applejack,"Well, what do we do now?"
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,pinkie pie,"Don't worry, ladies, I've been keeping excellent score all day! [quietly] Hmm, move the decimal, carry the 2, and... [aloud] Congratulations! You're tied!"
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,applejack,Tied?
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,rainbow dash,You can't be tied for the Most Daring Pony!
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,rainbow dash,"Okay, no problem. We just have to come up with another daring dare."
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,applejack,Right. I think I might have an idea of what we can do.
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,fluttershy,"Um, Rarity? Don't you think it's a little late in the day to be walking through the forest? It is... star-spider season, after all. Though, I'm sure you have a very good reason."
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,rarity,Simply the most important reason I've ever had in my entire life!
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,fluttershy,"Oh, well then I'm happy to help. What is it?"
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,rarity,"I've heard rumors that the Castle of the Two Sisters is filled with the most gorgeous of ancient tapestries in all of pony history! It pains me to think of those magnificent creations rotting away in those old ruins, totally unappreciated."
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,fluttershy,I see...
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,rarity,I require your help in borrowing one or two to bring back to the boutique where I can restore them. Maybe I'll even use the patterns as the inspiration for a new line!
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,fluttershy,That does sound... very important.
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,fluttershy,"Um, are you sure you need those tapestries?"
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,rarity,"But, of course. Although, I must admit these ruins are a fright. Just look at all the dirt everywhere! Ugh..."
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,fluttershy,[gasp] Angel!
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,fluttershy,"Angel! Oh, you really shouldn't have run off like that. Ancient ruins are filled with all sorts of things that can hurt you! You could stub your toe, or, or trip on a loose stone... You have to be careful!"
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,spike,"I don't think I'll need all these candles, Twilight. I was really only scared for a second."
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"Oh, these aren't for you, Spike. We're gonna be studying late into the night, and we're gonna need all the light we can get."
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,spike,"Oh, great."
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,applejack,"Well, here we are!"
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,rainbow dash,"Uh, what's so daring about this place? This is where we got the Elements of Harmony."
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,applejack,"When I was just a filly, Granny Smith told me of an ancient legend. When Nightmare Moon was banished, not every last bit of her dark magic went with her. Granny used to say, when night falls on the castle, that magic takes the form of... the Pony of Shadows!"
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,rainbow dash,"You mean, like a ghost?"
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,applejack,[spookily] Nopony knows!
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,rainbow dash,Ugh.
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,rarity,[excited gasp] This one is perfect!
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,fluttershy,"Well, it certainly could use some restoration."
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,rarity,"Be a dear, fly up there and lift it off that hook?"
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,rarity,[calling out] Maybe from below?
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,rainbow dash,"I don't see what's so daring about an old legend. Plus, I don't believe in ghosts."
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,applejack,You might wanna rethink your position on that.
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,applejack,"You saw that, right?"
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,rainbow dash,Run!
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,fluttershy,Ow... I think I hurt my wing.
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,rarity,"Oh, my dear, I am so sorry! That tapestry is far too heavy. We'll just have to find a smaller one."
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,fluttershy,"Oh, of course."
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,rarity,"Where, pray tell, did you disappear to?"
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,fluttershy,What do you mean?
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,rarity,"While you were struggling under that fabric, the entire wall spun around! You must have activated a secret door."
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,fluttershy,"Oh, I'm sorry."
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,rarity,I suppose these ruins are chock full of them.
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,fluttershy,Really?
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,rarity,Absolutely. We must use the utmost care as we<U+0097>
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,rainbow dash,"[panting] Okay, so, maybe the legend is true!"
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,applejack,"Well, that's why I brought you here! I guess only the most daring pony of all could stay in this castle all night without being scared off."
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,rainbow dash,Scared? I'm not scared!
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,applejack,"Well, m-me neither!"
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,rainbow dash,Then it's settled! Whoever stays in the castle the longest is the Most Daring Pony.
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,applejack,Deal.
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,rainbow dash,But it's gonna take a lot more than some shadowy ghost pony to get me to leave.
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,applejack,Me too! Humph!
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"Find anything, Spike?"
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,spike,"Uh, nope. Nothing yet."
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,spike,Aaah!
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,Angel? What are you doing here?
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,[gasp] Whoa! [reading] The Journal of the Two Sisters. [gasp] Maybe this is the book Princess Celestia was talking about!
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,rainbow dash,"I sure hope you're not afraid of the dark, Applejack!"
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,applejack,"I can't say that I am! But even if I was, I'd be at least fifty percent less scared of it than you, Rainbow Dash."
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,rainbow dash,I dunno how all that math works because I'm not scared at all!
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,applejack,Me neither!
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,applejack,Huh?
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,rainbow dash,W-what's the matter? It's just a dark hallway full of... disembodied pony legs.
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,applejack,Yeah. Nothin'... creepy about that.
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,rarity,I'm starting to wonder if maybe this castle doesn't want my expertise!
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,fluttershy,"Oh dear. Angel? Rarity, have you seen him?"
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,rarity,"I'm not sure he made the trip down with us, dear."
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,fluttershy,"Oh, goodness! We have to find him. An ancient castle is no place for a bunny. He could get hit by falling debris, or the floor could give out under him! Oh! He could be trapped in a dark place with no way out!"
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,rarity,[flatly] I can only imagine how that might feel. Hmm...
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,rainbow dash,"Applejack, if you're scared, you can just admit it. You don't need to put your hoof around me."
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,applejack,"Uh, I'm over here."
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,fluttershy,Rarity! What is it?
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,rarity,I felt something... alive!
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,fluttershy,[gasp] Angel!
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,fluttershy,"But we can't leave now, not with Angel lost somewhere in this dangerous old castle! He could be trapped under a crumbling statue, or stuck high in a tower without food or water or any friends at all!"
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"Spike, you've got to hear this. [reading] I love to duck behind the paintings, and though the Hall of Hooves still gives her a bit of a fright, the trap door slide is Luna's favorite."
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,spike,"""Hall of Hooves""?"
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,[reading] Soon the Organ to the Outside will be finished. I can hardly wait.
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,spike,"What's the ""Organ to the Outside""?"
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,[happily] I have no idea!
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,applejack,You hear that?
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,rainbow dash,"You mean, the creepy sound of a haunted pipe organ?"
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,applejack,Uh... maybe?
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,rainbow dash,[worried] I don't know what you're talking about!
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,spike,"Uh, Twilight? Did you hear something?"
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"Oh, Spike. Quit being such a scaredy-dragon. This castle is thousands of years old, and half of it was destroyed by Nightmare Moon. Of course it makes strange sounds. It's practically falling apart!"
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,spike,Oh... kay.
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,fluttershy,[calling] Angel! Angel!
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,rarity,I'm sure we'll find him.
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,fluttershy,Angel?
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,fluttershy,Did you find Angel? Is he okay?
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,rarity,[gasp] They are perfect! No castle in its right mind could possibly object to my restoring such exquisite works of art.
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,fluttershy,"Oh! They're lovely, Rarity, but... I have to keep looking for Angel. Oh, I hope he doesn't think I've given up on him."
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,rarity,I'm right behind you! Won't... [grunts] be... [grunts] a moment!
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,applejack,Do you think there's a single room in this castle that isn't filled with terrifying things?
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,rainbow dash,Whoa! [nervous laughter] It's just old pony armor. What's the big deal?
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,applejack,Yeah! It's not like it's gonna come to life or anything. Right?
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,applejack,Huh?!
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,applejack,Whoa-oa!
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,rarity,"[groans, spits] Now, you look here, castle! You are very old and very scary! But your wall art is in an atrocious state!"
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,rarity,And there is nothing you can do to keep me from my sacred task of restoration!
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,rainbow dash,"Uh... Applejack? If you went back to Ponyville, that means I win, right?"
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,fluttershy,"[calling] Rarity! I know hiding isn't really your sense of humor, but please let this be a joke!"
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,applejack,"[screams] [echoing] Rainbow? Hello? I guess if I don't find you, I win by default, right?"
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,rarity,"[grunts] [grumbles] Of all the castles in Equestria, this is by far the most ungrateful!"
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,rarity,Oof!
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,fluttershy,[whispered yelling] Angel! Rarity! Oh... I hope you two are together.
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,rainbow dash,"Haunted statues, creepy armor... Come on, castle! Is that all you got?"
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,fluttershy,[whimpering] [gasp] Angel?
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,fluttershy,AAANGEEEEEL!!!
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,What in the world is that?!
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,spike,"Oh, you know. Probably just more strange sounds of this old castle falling apart!"
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"No one likes sarcasm, Spike."
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,spike,What got into them?
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,fluttershy,"[grunting] It's okay, Angel! You're okay! You're okay!"
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,applejack,Yaaaaah! Shadows everywhere!
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,fluttershy,[sobbing] Aaangeeeeel!
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"Alright, everypony, stop!"
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,applejack,Twilight?
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,fluttershy,Must... save... Ange<U+0097>! ...Oh.
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,rainbow dash,Fluttershy? What are you doing here?
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,rarity,She's with me...
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,rarity,[gasps] Thank you.
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"Have you all spent the whole night running around, scaring each other?"
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,applejack,"Well, that depends."
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,On what?
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,rainbow dash,On whether or not you're the Pony of Shadows.
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,spike,What's... the Pony of Shadows?
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"Oh, that's just an old ponies' tale."
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,spike,Then who's playing... that?
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,We're going to find out.
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,[whispered] The Pony of Shadows!
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,pinkie pie,"Hey, you guys! Did you know I can totally play the organ? Because I didn't!"
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,pinkie pie,Check it out!
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,rainbow dash,You're the Pony of Shadows?
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,pinkie pie,[continues playing light melody] The pony of what?
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,See? What'd I tell ya?
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,applejack,I thought you went to ring the school bell all week!
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,pinkie pie,"Oh, yeah! I only had to ring it for, like, five minutes! They said that was good enough! Eh, can't imagine why..."
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,pinkie pie,"So then, I decided to throw a ""finish ringing the school bell"" party! But I didn't have any bluebells, and you can't throw a ""finish ringing the school bell"" party without bluebells, so I went to Everfree Forest to pick some, but it started to get so chilly."
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,pinkie pie,"I had to wrap myself up in the tarp I was gonna use to gather flowers, and then I saw Fluttershy and Rarity. But they went into the castle before I could invite them to my party. Luckily, I followed them inside so I could help you all with your party!"
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,rarity,What party is that?
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,pinkie pie,Duh!
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,rarity,"I swear, this is going right back where I found it just as soon as I've returned it to its former glory."
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,fluttershy,"Now don't go running off again! Oh, I can't believe I was so frightened. Guess I let my imagination get the best of me."
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,applejack,I think we all did.
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,pinkie pie,I always let my imagination run away from me! Then it comes back... with cake!
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"Well, it's good to know that whenever your imagination is getting away from you, a good friend can help you rein it in. And even though I didn't find anything out about the mysterious chest, I'm glad I was here to help all of you."
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,rarity,"You certainly did that, Twilight."
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,rainbow dash,Yeah! Why weren't you scared?
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"Reading Celestia's diary made it hard to be afraid, because I knew what it was like when she and Luna lived here. Knowing something about the past made it easier to deal with my problems in the present, even the scary ones."
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"I've just thought of a great idea! Why don't we keep a journal, just like the royal pony sisters?"
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,fluttershy,All of us?
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"Sure! That way we can learn from each other! And maybe some day, other ponies will read it and learn something, too!"
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,rarity,What a splendid idea!
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,applejack,"I know what my first entry will be! ""Dear Diary, I'm glad Granny Smith's legend wasn't true."""
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,rainbow dash,Me too!
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,pinkie pie,Me three! Because that means you two are still tied for Most Daring Pony!
Castle Mane-ia,Josh Haber,spike,"Heh, Shadow Ponies... How ridiculous is that?"
Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,"Four more months, four more months, four more months! I bet you're excited, huh?"
Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,fluttershy,"Oh, my. I, uh, I could be excited. I don't really know. I wasn't really think<U+0097>"
Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,"Come on, you gotta be excited!"
Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,fluttershy,"Oh, well, I guess maybe I'm a little kinda sort of excited."
Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,I thought so!
Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,fluttershy,"Yeah... So, um, why am I excited?"
Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,"Because the next Daring Do book is coming out exactly four months from today! That's how exciting it is! So what amazing, incredible, awesome adventure do you think Daring Do will have in her next book, huh?"
Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,"[voice over] Will she at long last stalk the Fortress of Talacon? Only to be forced to contend with its dreaded and impenetrable arrow defense? And if so, could her skill, quick wits, and courage possibly carry the day? Or will her next adventure bring her face to face with the vast and horrible Ahuizotl himself?!"
Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,"Would she cower, turn tail and run? Or would she fly at him, full bore, knowing full well against all odds that the greatest challenge she ever faced was still surely no match for<U+0097>"
Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,fluttershy,"Oh, I'm not so sure she's gonna last another four months..."
Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,"Three months and twenty six days, three months and twenty six days, three months and twenty six days! Heya, Twilight! Aren't you excited that<U+0097>"
Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,So glad you've finally made it!
Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,What's everypony doing here?
Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,So what holiday would today be?
Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,National Random Holiday Party Day! Woo-hoo!
Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,rarity,I've never heard of it either. [sips] But the punch is quite tasty.
Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,How come nopony bothered to invite me?
Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,applejack,"I came to invite you personally, but it seems you were a speck too busy reading the last Daring Do book for the twelfth time."
Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,"Yeah, well, in three months and twenty six more days, I'll be able to read the next one."
Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"Oh, haven't you heard? The release of the next book got pushed another two months."
Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,[spit-take] Two more months?! I've been waiting so long already! I don't think I can take another two months! I'll never make it!
Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,fluttershy,Yeah. I can vouch for that...
Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,Did they give a reason?
Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,The publisher just said author A.K. Yearling won't be able to finish the book for another two months. Cupcakes?
Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,[growls] How could you possibly know that before me? I'm the series' biggest fan!
Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"I'm just as big a fan as you! In fact, I'm the one who first introduced you to the books, remember?"
Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,Oh. Right.
Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"A.K. Yearling just might be my favorite author. I know everything about her. Where she grew up, where she studied literature, where she wrote the first Daring Do book..."
Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,Where she lives?
Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"Uh... no, though I could probably find out somehow. Why?"
Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,"Don't you get it? The new book is obviously delayed because she needs help dealing with whatever everyday nonsense is distracting her from spending her every living breathing second writing! So I<U+0096> I mean, fans like me, can get to read the new book ASAP! Think about it! We could help her with her laundry, buy her groceries, cooking her meals, whatever! Now, who wouldn't appreciate that?"
Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"Hmm, I don't know... What she probably wants most of all is respect for her privacy."
Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,She can always just say no.
Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,Mmh... I suppose you're right...
Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,Of course I am. So... how's about getting that address?
Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,You see what I mean? Why would she live in this remote part of Equestria except to keep folks from intruding on her privacy? We should respec<U+0097>
Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,I think I spotted the house! We're super close! This way!
Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,Wait! Oh no. What happened?
Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,Apparently somepony has intruded on her privacy pretty hard already...
Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,applejack,"Hoo-wee, somepony really trashed this place."
Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,"Hmm... Maybe... or maybe A.K. Yearling's just a terrible, horrible, unbelievable slob!"
Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,rarity,I hope A.K. Yearling's alright!
Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,Oh no! What if something terrible happened to her?
Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,"I know! There might be no more books! Uh... But, of course, I'd be worried about her, too. Heh."
Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,We didn't do this! We swear!
Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,applejack,"We didn't do this, Ms. Yearling<U+0097> whoa!"
Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,We're awfully glad to see you're alright.
Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,Great! Maybe now would be a good time for me to ask her how we can help move the new book along a little faster. Chop chop!
Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"Rainbow Dash, a minute please! A.K. Yearling has made it pretty clear that she wants to be left alone. We need to respect her wishes!"
Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,You should tell that to those guys.
Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,A.K. Yearling and Daring Do are one and the same! My mind is officially blown!
Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,"Aw, come on, I knew it all along."
Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,applejack,Amazing!
Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,rarity,Incredible!
Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,Wow! So much action! Whee!
Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,Daring Do!
Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,dr. caballeron,"Dr. Many thanks, Daring Do. As you've probably surmised, our earlier search for this treasure was... unsuccessful. So kind of you to find it for us."
Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,daring do,"[grunting] Give it back, Caballeron!"
Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,dr. caballeron,Dr. That's Doctor Caballeron to you.
Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,[hushed] He's from book four: Daring Do and the Razor of Dreams. He wanted to partner with Daring Do on her adventures.
Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"I know, but she refused! I can't believe it! The real Daring Do and the real Caballeron!"
Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,daring do,So let me guess: Ahuizotl has put you up to this? You're stealing the ring to give to him so his hold on the Fortress of Talacon will be good for eight centuries as foretold by prophecy!
Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,dr. caballeron,"Dr. Close, but... no. I'm going to sell this to him, make a bundle, and retire from archaeology in splendor."
Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,daring do,"[grunting] Caballeron, you fool! You're dooming the valley to eight centuries of unrelenting heat!"
Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,dr. caballeron,"Dr. To market, henchponies!"
Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,fluttershy,"Uh... should we go in and help her, maybe?"
Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,[gasps] Are you okay?
Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,daring do,I got this.
Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,fluttershy,"Um, she was just trying to help, Ms. Do."
Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,daring do,Daring Do doesn't need help. She handles her business herself.
Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,We've gotta go help!
Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,You heard her! She says she works alone!
Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,How can we just stand by and do nothing? You know what's at stake here! Ahuizotl has sought control of the Tenochtitlan Basin since book three!
Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"True, but in book four, she defeated Ahuizotl and secured control of the Amulet of Atonement, dispelling the dark magic of the Ketztwctl Empress, and thus protecting the basin with the Radiant Shield of Razdon!"
Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,But the Radiant Shield of Razdon is vulnerable to the dark enchantment of the Rings of Scorchero!
Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"But are you forgetting that the Rings were scattered to the four corners of Tenochtitlan, thus rendering the dark enchantment powerless?"
Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,"Only if you assume that the Rings have yet to be retrieved, and the ring Caballeron just stole isn't the last to completely restore the dark tower and its cruel hold on Tenochtitlan! Did you ever think of that?!"
Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,"You gotta admit, Rainbow Dash makes a pretty good point."
Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,We gotta help Daring Do retrieve the ring for safekeeping before it's too late!
Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"[sighs] Okay, but sounds to me like we're in way, way, way over our heads. We're going to need a carefully thought out plan..."
Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,"I'm coming, Daring Do!"
Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,That's not a plan!
Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,"Come on, come on, come on... Bingo! Here I come, Daring Do! To join an adventure with the greatest, bravest, coolest, most incredible hero I could ever<U+0096> [whimpers] Okay, maybe I just need a sec... Just another adventure. No big deal. [smack] Get a grip! I got this. Though, doing it alongside Daring Do... Wow! Maybe I could get my picture taken with her, or an autograph<U+0096> [smack] There you go again. She's just a pony like any other pony. A pony who stops entire armies of bad guys with nothing more than her bare hooves, and an attitude, and<U+0097>! [smack] Ow... That's starting to hurt."
Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,Yow! Stop!
Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,daring do,"Oh, it's just you."
Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,"Wait, wait, wait! Let me help you! I promise I could be a huge, huge help if you just give me a chance."
Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,daring do,I. Work. Alone.
Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,But why won't you let me team up with you just this once?!
Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,daring do,"My work always involves secrets. And since you never know who you can trust, it's best never to trust anypony."
Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,"But just because you can't trust some, doesn't mean nopony can be trusted!"
Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,daring do,"Look, I don't have time to argue-"
Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,Neither do I. Let's go!
Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,daring do,[sighs] [under her breath] Can't believe I'm even talking to her...
Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,Looks like they decided to have an early dinner before making their way back down the hill to the marketplace in town.
Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,"Oh, I see. You're gonna ambush them like in book four at the Horavian caves! Or maybe, that neat trick you did in book three, where you swoop in and knock three guys down with one swing! Or maybe- [hushed] Okay. I'll be quiet now. Just watching very quietly, heh. Shh. So, what kind of ambush are you gonna use then?"
Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,Wow!
Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,daring do,[gravely voice] I have been led to believe you have in your possession an item of significant importance that might be... for sale.
Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,dr. caballeron,"Dr. Oh, uh, well... I did have another buyer lined up, but he's not here, so... sounds like we have a deal."
Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,daring do,Ahuizotl!
Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,"Be cool, Rainbow Dash, be cool... she's got this!"
Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,daring do,"Now, Ahuizotl, you know I love you, but I can't give you the ring 'til I've properly proposed."
Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,daring do,Bring it!
Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,"Come on, Daring Do, come on..."
Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,Daring Do! I've got your hat! You want me to toss it? Daring Do! Daring Do!
Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,"Don't worry, Daring Do! I'll come help you! Whoa! Ow."
Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,daring do,Don't bother! I'd say you've already helped plenty.
Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,What have I done?
Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,rarity,[gasps] Thank goodness you're alright!
Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"Quick, where does it hurt?"
Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,"In here. Daring Do and the ring have been captured by the dreaded Ahuizotl, and it's all my fault."
Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"Dash, I'm sure whatever you did was an honest mistake."
Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,Whatever. Let's just go home.
Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,applejack,We can't go back now! Looks a mite like she needs our help more than ever!
Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,"Trying to help is how I got in this mess in the first place. You were right, Twilight. We should've stayed out of this."
Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"Look, there is more going on here than meets the eye. In every Daring Do book, there always is! We can't turn our backs on her!"
Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,"She doesn't want my help, Twilight."
Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,Perhaps. But she might need it anyway.
Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,No. My hero's way better off without me.
Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,applejack,This don't sound like you.
Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,Where's the Rainbow Dash who would help anypony at the drop of a hat?
Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,rarity,"Or pith helmet, as the case may be."
Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,She's here where she's got no business being. She should be at home.
Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"It's fine to look up to Daring Do, but you've put her so high up on a pedestal, you can't even see your own worth anymore! She's in the fortress, and we're here, and we wouldn't be who we are if we didn't go in after her! And neither would you! So, are you with us, or not?"
Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,"Gotcha! [grunts] You can flap too, y'know!"
Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,daring do,"I was just about to save myself, y'know."
Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,Of course. I just thought you might need this.
Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,daring do,Have I mentioned yet that I work alone?
Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,Have I mentioned yet that you're lucky I don't?
Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,applejack,"Drop the ring, Ahui... whatever your name is!"
Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,daring do,Come with me! Help me get all these rings off!
Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,daring do,"[panting] If we can remove the giant ring at the bottom, the whole fortress will collapse!"
Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,W-Was this your plan all along?
Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,daring do,I had to find a way to get into the fortress.
Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,You did it on purpose?! But<U+0096> but I thought<U+0097>
Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,daring do,"I didn't count on how heavy this ring would be, though... Guess having a little help can be handy sometimes."
Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,daring do,"[straining noises] You can flap too, y'know!"
Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,[straining noises] Ponies! Run! This place is goin' down!
Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,daring do,"Could never have done this without you, Rainbow Dash. I've got a book to finish!"
Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,"Just had the coolest adventure with the coolest pony ever. Came this close to blowing it because I got so wrapped up in how awesome she was, I almost forgot about how awesome I was. Good thing I didn't, 'cause it gave me a chance to show her how important it is to put your trust in somepony else."
Daring Don't,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,Sweet! The new book a week before anypony else gets it! [inhales] Ohmygoshohmygoshohmygoshohmygosh!
Flight to the Finish,Ed Valentine,cheerilee,"Today, we have two special guests with a very special announcement! Everypony, welcome the head of the Equestria Games, Ms. Harshwhinny!"
Flight to the Finish,Ed Valentine,rainbow dash,"[distant] Oh, come on! Tell 'em the fun part!"
Flight to the Finish,Ed Valentine,rainbow dash,"That's right! All you gotta do is show Ms. Harshwhinny the coolest, most spectacular, most rocking routine and you're going to the Games! So who's going to be the lucky ponies?!"
Flight to the Finish,Ed Valentine,diamond tiara,It's gotta be me!
Flight to the Finish,Ed Valentine,scootaloo,Maybe it's us!
Flight to the Finish,Ed Valentine,snips,Hey! It could happen!
Flight to the Finish,Ed Valentine,rainbow dash,"So, the winning team gets to carry the Ponyville flag at the Equestria Games! Oh, you are gonna love this!"
Flight to the Finish,Ed Valentine,rainbow dash,"Aw, get to the nitty-gritty later. Tell 'em the important stuff! Like who's the coach! [blows whistle] That's right! Me! And you know why I'm qualified to coach you? Guess who carried the Cloudsdale flag in the Games when she was a little filly? Me! I'll never forget it <U+0096>- I burst into the stadium, spreading my wings, the flag flapping in the breeze. I did tricks with that flag the likes of which nopony saw before and nopony's seen since!"
Flight to the Finish,Ed Valentine,rainbow dash,"Yes, Ms. Harshwhinny. Y'know, ""professionalism"" is my middle name. Rainbow Professionalism Dash."
Flight to the Finish,Ed Valentine,rainbow dash,"Ahem. Yes. Quite, quite correct. In the meantime, get ready to train, and train hard, because I know this opening ceremony is the single most important thing that will ever happen in your young lives! But, I know you're up for the challenge. And so am I! Wooho-- Ahem... Meet me after school tomorrow at 1500 hours. Sharp. And show me your flag carrying skills. I am outta here. Professionally. See how professionally?"
Flight to the Finish,Ed Valentine,scootaloo,So what do you say we come up with the perfect routine and win this thing?
Flight to the Finish,Ed Valentine,apple bloom,I'd say that's rootin'-tootin' terrific!
Flight to the Finish,Ed Valentine,sweetie belle,But there's one problem! I bet everypony in class is planning to compete!
Flight to the Finish,Ed Valentine,scootaloo,"Listen. Somepony in our class is gonna carry that flag, so it might as well be us! Crusaders, are you in or are you in? 'Cause I'm in!"
Flight to the Finish,Ed Valentine,apple bloom,Me too!
Flight to the Finish,Ed Valentine,sweetie belle,Me three!
Flight to the Finish,Ed Valentine,scootaloo,"Alright, the winning routine needs to show what's important about Ponyville, right?"
Flight to the Finish,Ed Valentine,scootaloo,So... what's special about Ponyville? It's... It's... I got it! It's a place where different kinds of ponies live together as friends!
Flight to the Finish,Ed Valentine,apple bloom,Earth ponies like me!
Flight to the Finish,Ed Valentine,sweetie belle,Unicorns like me!
Flight to the Finish,Ed Valentine,scootaloo,And Pegasi like me! So somehow we got to figure out a way to show that in our act.
Flight to the Finish,Ed Valentine,sweetie belle,We're gonna need a plan.
Flight to the Finish,Ed Valentine,apple bloom,And a lot of hard work!
Flight to the Finish,Ed Valentine,scootaloo,"And a whole bunch of practice! But take it from me; we may just be little ponies, but we have hearts as strong as horses!"
Flight to the Finish,Ed Valentine,diamond tiara,"If that's the best you've got, we're going to win for sure."
Flight to the Finish,Ed Valentine,silver spoon,We already have the most divine routine planned.
Flight to the Finish,Ed Valentine,diamond tiara,It's absolutely sure to crush everyone else <U+0096> and I mean crush.
Flight to the Finish,Ed Valentine,scootaloo,But we're winners! And we have [starts singing] hearts--
Flight to the Finish,Ed Valentine,silver spoon,Sure. But you know what you don't have?
Flight to the Finish,Ed Valentine,apple bloom,What does that have to do with flag carryin'?
Flight to the Finish,Ed Valentine,silver spoon,Having cutie mark-less ponies represent Ponyville would be unthinkable.
Flight to the Finish,Ed Valentine,diamond tiara,"And we, of course, already have our cutie marks. So we know who's gonna be in the winner's circle."
Flight to the Finish,Ed Valentine,scootaloo,"Listen, you two! Cutie marks or no cutie marks, you'll see! The Crusaders are gonna carry that flag at the Games."
Flight to the Finish,Ed Valentine,silver spoon,May the best ponies win!
Flight to the Finish,Ed Valentine,scootaloo,Game on!
Flight to the Finish,Ed Valentine,rainbow dash,"Show me what you got, Cutie Mark Crusaders, and make it good!"
Flight to the Finish,Ed Valentine,scootaloo,"Don't worry, we will!"
Flight to the Finish,Ed Valentine,sweetie belle,"Now, this is just a little something we threw together. It's not perfect yet, not even close."
Flight to the Finish,Ed Valentine,diamond tiara,"Let's watch the Cutie Mark ""Goof-saders"" do their saddle routine."
Flight to the Finish,Ed Valentine,silver spoon,They're gonna be a hot mess!
Flight to the Finish,Ed Valentine,scootaloo,"Since the dawn of recorded time, in one town of amazing amazingness, three types of ponies coexist!"
Flight to the Finish,Ed Valentine,apple bloom,We are Earth ponies!
Flight to the Finish,Ed Valentine,sweetie belle,We are unicorns!
Flight to the Finish,Ed Valentine,scootaloo,"We are Pegasi! And the town where friendship reigns is our home. Now, welcome to the stadium, the flag of the place we love best..."
Flight to the Finish,Ed Valentine,scootaloo,It's kind of a work in progress. So? What did you think?
Flight to the Finish,Ed Valentine,rainbow dash,"That was ama-- [in her head] Wait. Hold on now. Gotta stay calm, cool and collected. [out loud] To give a calm, clear analysis-- Wait. You whipped that act together just yesterday?! That is-- [in her head] Professionalism, Dash, keep those emotions in check! [out loud] Overall, it was... kinda, sorta... [quickly] Overall, it was okay. Keep working hard. Who knows? You might have a shot. Gotta go!"
Flight to the Finish,Ed Valentine,apple bloom,Do y'all think she liked it?
Flight to the Finish,Ed Valentine,sweetie belle,I'm not really sure.
Flight to the Finish,Ed Valentine,scootaloo,"You heard her! If we keep working hard, we might have a shot! So let's keep working! Trot to it, ponies!"
Flight to the Finish,Ed Valentine,diamond tiara,Did you see that?! I can't believe I'm saying this. They could win!
Flight to the Finish,Ed Valentine,silver spoon,But how do we stop them? We already called them blank flanks!
Flight to the Finish,Ed Valentine,diamond tiara,Then we need to find a new way to get under their skin. Or maybe... get under their wings.
Flight to the Finish,Ed Valentine,diamond tiara,"Girls, we just wanted to say your act is quite impressive!"
Flight to the Finish,Ed Valentine,sweetie belle,Wait... What?
Flight to the Finish,Ed Valentine,apple bloom,Um... Thanks?
Flight to the Finish,Ed Valentine,silver spoon,"Oh, but of course. As a matter of fact, we think you're very brave."
Flight to the Finish,Ed Valentine,scootaloo,Brave? Why?
Flight to the Finish,Ed Valentine,diamond tiara,"Isn't it obvious? It is to us. In fact, it's obvious to everypony. You're showing all three types of Ponyville ponies, yet you have a Pegasus pony..."
Flight to the Finish,Ed Valentine,apple bloom,What in tarnation does that have to do with anything?
Flight to the Finish,Ed Valentine,silver spoon,I'd say not even being able to fly has everything to do with everything. Doesn't it?
Flight to the Finish,Ed Valentine,diamond tiara,"I mean, a Pegasus pony at your age? You should've been flying long ago."
Flight to the Finish,Ed Valentine,scootaloo,So what if my wings can't get me off the ground?
Flight to the Finish,Ed Valentine,diamond tiara,Your career as a flag carrier isn't getting off the ground either.
Flight to the Finish,Ed Valentine,silver spoon,Ms. Harshwhinny will never pick a Pegasus pony who can't fly to represent Ponyville in front of all of Equestria.
Flight to the Finish,Ed Valentine,sweetie belle,Ms. Harshwhinny never said anything about that!
Flight to the Finish,Ed Valentine,silver spoon,I would've thought that was obvious.
Flight to the Finish,Ed Valentine,diamond tiara,"Well, have fun practicing anyway, even if your routine will never<U+0097>how shall I say<U+0097>take off!"
Flight to the Finish,Ed Valentine,sweetie belle,"Don't listen to them, Scootaloo. Scootaloo? You okay?"
Flight to the Finish,Ed Valentine,scootaloo,This routine isn't working how it is. We've gotta rethink my part in the whole thing.
Flight to the Finish,Ed Valentine,sweetie belle,What?
Flight to the Finish,Ed Valentine,apple bloom,Why?
Flight to the Finish,Ed Valentine,scootaloo,"If we wanna win, I'm gonna have to fly!"
Flight to the Finish,Ed Valentine,sweetie belle,Is that even possible?
Flight to the Finish,Ed Valentine,apple bloom,And by tomorrow?
Flight to the Finish,Ed Valentine,scootaloo,Maybe I can win if I work twice as hard. See? Oof! Maybe... three times as hard.
Flight to the Finish,Ed Valentine,apple bloom,"Golly, I don't know, Scootaloo, I don't think that's the problem."
Flight to the Finish,Ed Valentine,scootaloo,"Well, I know this for sure <U+0096> flying is the only way we're gonna win, so it's back to practice!"
Flight to the Finish,Ed Valentine,sweetie belle,Is this a good idea?
Flight to the Finish,Ed Valentine,scootaloo,Whoaaaaa!
Flight to the Finish,Ed Valentine,scootaloo,I'll just work four times as hard!
Flight to the Finish,Ed Valentine,apple bloom,Probably not.
Flight to the Finish,Ed Valentine,scootaloo,"[sighs] Guys, guys, guys! Try it again!"
Flight to the Finish,Ed Valentine,apple bloom,[yawns] But we've been rehearsin' all the livelong day! We're gettin' tired!
Flight to the Finish,Ed Valentine,scootaloo,"Fine! We'll skip to my big impressive flying entrance. So you've done the do-si-do to the left, then to the right, and then there's the hoop. Then I come in--"
Flight to the Finish,Ed Valentine,apple bloom,[hushed] I liked the routine the way it was!
Flight to the Finish,Ed Valentine,sweetie belle,[hushed] Me too! But all she cares about now is flying!
Flight to the Finish,Ed Valentine,scootaloo,"[panting] Ponyville! Home of the, um..."
Flight to the Finish,Ed Valentine,scootaloo,"Ah, friendship, right! Uh, there are four-- no, three kinds of ponies."
Flight to the Finish,Ed Valentine,sweetie belle,"[hushed] Left, left!"
Flight to the Finish,Ed Valentine,apple bloom,"[hushed] I'm sorry! I'm just tired! And then I dip, and then we turn, and-- Sorry!"
Flight to the Finish,Ed Valentine,scootaloo,Ta-da! Oof! [panting] So? What'cha think?
Flight to the Finish,Ed Valentine,rainbow dash,"That's... y'know... good and all, heheh... I just thought... maybe possibly you might wanna go back to, say, the first version of the act, which was, I dunno, what's the word, better? Just do the routine as it was! Don't mess with success, right? Seriously. Now I need to... go coach these other ponies! And don't forget, we've got to catch the early train for the Crystal Empire. See you in the morning!"
Flight to the Finish,Ed Valentine,scootaloo,"What are we gonna do?! We're competing tomorrow, and I still can't fly! Unless..."
Flight to the Finish,Ed Valentine,sweetie belle,I'm just too tired! I can't keep going!
Flight to the Finish,Ed Valentine,apple bloom,"Me too! I'm tired, I'm hungry, and now I hate this routine! It feels like it's all about you now!"
Flight to the Finish,Ed Valentine,sweetie belle,She's right. It's like you don't even need us anymore!
Flight to the Finish,Ed Valentine,scootaloo,"Of course I need you! Without you two, who's gonna hold up the hoop?"
Flight to the Finish,Ed Valentine,apple bloom,Rrgh! You don't listen to yourself! Forget it. I'm goin' home to get some sleep.
Flight to the Finish,Ed Valentine,scootaloo,So? Are you gonna leave me too?
Flight to the Finish,Ed Valentine,sweetie belle,"We've gotta catch the early train to the Crystal Empire. I'd better get some rest. See you in the morning, Scootaloo."
Flight to the Finish,Ed Valentine,scootaloo,"Come on, Scootaloo! Do it for Ponyville! Just got to try twenty times as hard! [straining noises] Thirty times as hard...! Oof! Just... a little... harder!"
Flight to the Finish,Ed Valentine,scootaloo,[straining noises] [sighs] I can't fly. I just... can't.
Flight to the Finish,Ed Valentine,sweetie belle,Scootaloo? Where is she?
Flight to the Finish,Ed Valentine,apple bloom,She'd better get here soon! This here train is about to leave!
Flight to the Finish,Ed Valentine,scootaloo,Here I am...
Flight to the Finish,Ed Valentine,apple bloom,We were scared you were gonna miss the train!
Flight to the Finish,Ed Valentine,scootaloo,I... I'm not going.
Flight to the Finish,Ed Valentine,scootaloo,"I'm the weak link. If I go, and fall, flop, or do anything but fly, I'm gonna blow it for you two."
Flight to the Finish,Ed Valentine,sweetie belle,I can't believe you're quitting on us!
Flight to the Finish,Ed Valentine,scootaloo,But you're better off without me!
Flight to the Finish,Ed Valentine,sweetie belle,"But that's not true, Scootaloo!"
Flight to the Finish,Ed Valentine,apple bloom,"You know what, Sweetie Belle? Forget it. If she's gonna quit, we don't want her, and we don't need her!"
Flight to the Finish,Ed Valentine,scootaloo,Fine!
Flight to the Finish,Ed Valentine,apple bloom,Fine!
Flight to the Finish,Ed Valentine,sweetie belle,Fine...
Flight to the Finish,Ed Valentine,rainbow dash,"How's my favorite routine going today? Oh, I just can't keep it in! I want you to win so bad! [to the BGM] Bom, bom, bom, bom... and then Scootaloo does that [half-whistles] through the hoop!"
Flight to the Finish,Ed Valentine,apple bloom,"Well, there ain't gonna be a Scootaloo."
Flight to the Finish,Ed Valentine,sweetie belle,She's staying home.
Flight to the Finish,Ed Valentine,rainbow dash,She's what?!
Flight to the Finish,Ed Valentine,apple bloom,"She got it in her head that the only way to represent Ponyville was by flyin' in our routine! When she couldn't do it, she told us that she was quittin'."
Flight to the Finish,Ed Valentine,rainbow dash,"And then you tried to stop her from doing that, right?"
Flight to the Finish,Ed Valentine,sweetie belle,"Well, actually, we kinda told her..."
Flight to the Finish,Ed Valentine,apple bloom,"...uh, that we didn't want a quitter."
Flight to the Finish,Ed Valentine,rainbow dash,"Hang on. Are you nuts?! You're a team, and a team never leaves a friend behind!"
Flight to the Finish,Ed Valentine,rainbow dash,Come on!
Flight to the Finish,Ed Valentine,diamond tiara,Sorry you can't make it! We'll take a picture for you from the winner's circle!
Flight to the Finish,Ed Valentine,sweetie belle,I do not like them one bit.
Flight to the Finish,Ed Valentine,rainbow dash,"Put on some speed, girls!"
Flight to the Finish,Ed Valentine,rainbow dash,Throwing away your scooter?!
Flight to the Finish,Ed Valentine,scootaloo,Rainbow Dash?
Flight to the Finish,Ed Valentine,rainbow dash,"Yup, but not just me."
Flight to the Finish,Ed Valentine,scootaloo,"I don't wanna see them. And what are they doing here, anyway? They're supposed to be on the train."
Flight to the Finish,Ed Valentine,apple bloom,We're not goin'.
Flight to the Finish,Ed Valentine,sweetie belle,"Not without you, Scootaloo."
Flight to the Finish,Ed Valentine,rainbow dash,"What's gotten into you, Scootaloo?"
Flight to the Finish,Ed Valentine,scootaloo,I didn't want to ruin their chance to win just because I couldn't fly.
Flight to the Finish,Ed Valentine,rainbow dash,And who said you had to?
Flight to the Finish,Ed Valentine,scootaloo,But flying's what Pegasus ponies are supposed to do! You flew when you carried the flag in the games!
Flight to the Finish,Ed Valentine,rainbow dash,"But that was me! You're you! And it just doesn't matter if you can fly or not. Your routine was amazing 'cause it represented exactly what makes Ponyville special. You do still know what that is, right?"
Flight to the Finish,Ed Valentine,sweetie belle,Friendship.
Flight to the Finish,Ed Valentine,apple bloom,Three kinds of ponies livin' together as friends. Just like us. Earth ponies...
Flight to the Finish,Ed Valentine,sweetie belle,...unicorns...
Flight to the Finish,Ed Valentine,scootaloo,...and Pegasi. But Rainbow Dash... what if... what if my wings never grow? What if I never fly?
Flight to the Finish,Ed Valentine,rainbow dash,"Listen, Scootaloo. Maybe you'll fly someday, or maybe you won't. You're all kinds of awesome anyway. Who's the toughest little pony in town?"
Flight to the Finish,Ed Valentine,sweetie belle,"Got the moves, got the mojo..."
Flight to the Finish,Ed Valentine,apple bloom,No harder working pony around.
Flight to the Finish,Ed Valentine,scootaloo,"We are a trio, work as a team"
Flight to the Finish,Ed Valentine,scootaloo,So let's get to the Crystal Empire and let's do the routine as it was! And let's win this thing!
Flight to the Finish,Ed Valentine,rainbow dash,Ahem. Look. What you three did was... acceptable.
Flight to the Finish,Ed Valentine,rainbow dash,"Contain your excitement, Ms. Harshwhinny. Remember <U+0096> professionalism."
Flight to the Finish,Ed Valentine,scootaloo,"You know what this means, right?"
Flight to the Finish,Ed Valentine,apple bloom,What?
Flight to the Finish,Ed Valentine,scootaloo,We are totally gonna get cutie marks in flag-carrying!
Power Ponies,"Meghan McCarthy, Charlotte Fullerton & Betsy McGowen",twilight sparkle,"Spike, you really need to go to sleep!"
Power Ponies,"Meghan McCarthy, Charlotte Fullerton & Betsy McGowen",spike,"Aw, two more minutes, Twilight! I'm just getting to the really good part! The Mane-iac is about to<U+0097>"
Power Ponies,"Meghan McCarthy, Charlotte Fullerton & Betsy McGowen",twilight sparkle,"""The Mane-iac""?"
Power Ponies,"Meghan McCarthy, Charlotte Fullerton & Betsy McGowen",spike,"The Power Ponies' most evil nemesis! She was the power-mad owner of a hair-care product company. A tragic accident at her shampoo factory in Maretropolis not only gave her mane strange new powers, but also caused her to go completely insane! She and her henchponies are planning to break into the Maretropolis Museum and steal the Electro-Orb, so she can use it to power up her doomsday device! Of course, the Mane-iac wouldn't have even known if Hum Drum hadn't slipped up and told her all about it."
Power Ponies,"Meghan McCarthy, Charlotte Fullerton & Betsy McGowen",twilight sparkle,Hum Drum?
Power Ponies,"Meghan McCarthy, Charlotte Fullerton & Betsy McGowen",spike,"Nah, the guy in the blue boots and pointless red cape. The Power Ponies' bumbling and totally useless sidekick. The Power Ponies have to stop the Mane-iac or Maretropolis is doo-hoo-hoo-hoomed!"
Power Ponies,"Meghan McCarthy, Charlotte Fullerton & Betsy McGowen",twilight sparkle,"Believe me, Spike. If anypony understands what it's like to get caught up in a really good book, it's me. But if we're going to make any progress fixing up Luna and Celestia's old castle tomorrow, we all have to do our part. We don't want to be too tired to lend a hoof... or claw."

Power Ponies,"Meghan McCarthy, Charlotte Fullerton & Betsy McGowen",twilight sparkle,"I think she's right. It looks like we've got it, Spike. Looking great, everypony! Why don't you find a quiet spot and finish reading your comic? Aren't you right at the part where Hum Drum was about to stop the villain?"
Power Ponies,"Meghan McCarthy, Charlotte Fullerton & Betsy McGowen",twilight sparkle,"Rarity, lemme give you a hoof with that!"
Power Ponies,"Meghan McCarthy, Charlotte Fullerton & Betsy McGowen",spike,I could do it!
Power Ponies,"Meghan McCarthy, Charlotte Fullerton & Betsy McGowen",twilight sparkle,"That's okay, Spike."

Power Ponies,"Meghan McCarthy, Charlotte Fullerton & Betsy McGowen",spike,I'm Hum Drum...?! Oh no... [straining noises] Applejack! You gotta... help stop the... tornado from destroying.. the city!
Power Ponies,"Meghan McCarthy, Charlotte Fullerton & Betsy McGowen",applejack,"But every time I move, this darn lasso gets tighter!"
Power Ponies,"Meghan McCarthy, Charlotte Fullerton & Betsy McGowen",spike,"You're psychically connected to it! Will it to where you want it to go, and it'll obey you!"
Power Ponies,"Meghan McCarthy, Charlotte Fullerton & Betsy McGowen",pinkie pie,[giggles] That was spin-tastic!
Power Ponies,"Meghan McCarthy, Charlotte Fullerton & Betsy McGowen",applejack,Lemme get this straight: We've been sucked into some kind of comic-book world?
Power Ponies,"Meghan McCarthy, Charlotte Fullerton & Betsy McGowen",spike,"Technically, it's called Maretropolis. And if we wanna get back to Ponyville, I think we have to stop the Mane-iac from using her doomsday device to destroy it!"
Power Ponies,"Meghan McCarthy, Charlotte Fullerton & Betsy McGowen",rainbow dash,No biggie. I was already awesome. And now we've all got superpowers!
Power Ponies,"Meghan McCarthy, Charlotte Fullerton & Betsy McGowen",spike,Almost all of us have superpowers...
Power Ponies,"Meghan McCarthy, Charlotte Fullerton & Betsy McGowen",rarity,"But you must have them too, Spikey-boo. Your character is wearing a cape!"
Power Ponies,"Meghan McCarthy, Charlotte Fullerton & Betsy McGowen",spike,"Yeah, for absolutely no reason. He's pretty much useless..."
Power Ponies,"Meghan McCarthy, Charlotte Fullerton & Betsy McGowen",twilight sparkle,"Good thing you're not really Hum Drum, then."
Power Ponies,"Meghan McCarthy, Charlotte Fullerton & Betsy McGowen",spike,"Yeah, good thing..."
Power Ponies,"Meghan McCarthy, Charlotte Fullerton & Betsy McGowen",rainbow dash,"So the six of us Power Ponies will take care of Mane-iac, and get us back to Ponyville!"
Power Ponies,"Meghan McCarthy, Charlotte Fullerton & Betsy McGowen",twilight sparkle,"Spike, where is the Mane-iac building her doomsday device?"
Power Ponies,"Meghan McCarthy, Charlotte Fullerton & Betsy McGowen",spike,Her top-secret headquarters! But you'd better get there quick. That glowing orb she just stole is what she's going to use to power it up!
Power Ponies,"Meghan McCarthy, Charlotte Fullerton & Betsy McGowen",applejack,"Lead the way, Spike!"
Power Ponies,"Meghan McCarthy, Charlotte Fullerton & Betsy McGowen",rainbow dash,Then leave the rest to us!
Power Ponies,"Meghan McCarthy, Charlotte Fullerton & Betsy McGowen",spike,There it is!
Power Ponies,"Meghan McCarthy, Charlotte Fullerton & Betsy McGowen",applejack,Is that a... shampoo factory?
Power Ponies,"Meghan McCarthy, Charlotte Fullerton & Betsy McGowen",twilight sparkle,"All right, Power Ponies, here's the plan. Rarity, you, me and<U+0097>"
Power Ponies,"Meghan McCarthy, Charlotte Fullerton & Betsy McGowen",rainbow dash,"Come on out, Mane-iac! Or the Power Ponies are comin' in!"
Power Ponies,"Meghan McCarthy, Charlotte Fullerton & Betsy McGowen",twilight sparkle,"So much for ""element of surprise""."
Power Ponies,"Meghan McCarthy, Charlotte Fullerton & Betsy McGowen",spike,Guess I'll just hang back here doing nothing.
Power Ponies,"Meghan McCarthy, Charlotte Fullerton & Betsy McGowen",fluttershy,"Oh, I don't think she's home. Maybe we should just come back later."
Power Ponies,"Meghan McCarthy, Charlotte Fullerton & Betsy McGowen",rarity,She's home.
Power Ponies,"Meghan McCarthy, Charlotte Fullerton & Betsy McGowen",applejack,Time to Power Pony up!
Power Ponies,"Meghan McCarthy, Charlotte Fullerton & Betsy McGowen",pinkie pie,Ooh! Nice catchphrase!
Power Ponies,"Meghan McCarthy, Charlotte Fullerton & Betsy McGowen",twilight sparkle,Freeze ray!
Power Ponies,"Meghan McCarthy, Charlotte Fullerton & Betsy McGowen",rarity,"It's an improvement, darling."
Power Ponies,"Meghan McCarthy, Charlotte Fullerton & Betsy McGowen",rarity,"Ooh, I do so love a functional accessory!"
Power Ponies,"Meghan McCarthy, Charlotte Fullerton & Betsy McGowen",rainbow dash,Seriously? You aren't even just a little angry right now?
Power Ponies,"Meghan McCarthy, Charlotte Fullerton & Betsy McGowen",twilight sparkle,"Nice work, Power Ponies! Now let's take care of the Mane-iac and get ourselves home!"
Power Ponies,"Meghan McCarthy, Charlotte Fullerton & Betsy McGowen",rainbow dash,Just watch us!
Power Ponies,"Meghan McCarthy, Charlotte Fullerton & Betsy McGowen",spike,The Hairspray Ray of Doom! It stops you in your tracks and renders your powers useless!
Power Ponies,"Meghan McCarthy, Charlotte Fullerton & Betsy McGowen",rarity,We'll just see about that!
Power Ponies,"Meghan McCarthy, Charlotte Fullerton & Betsy McGowen",spike,"Fluttershy, please! Just a little anger?!"
Power Ponies,"Meghan McCarthy, Charlotte Fullerton & Betsy McGowen",fluttershy,"Well, I'm not so much angry as I am concerned, bordering on terrified!"
Power Ponies,"Meghan McCarthy, Charlotte Fullerton & Betsy McGowen",spike,Don't spray!
Power Ponies,"Meghan McCarthy, Charlotte Fullerton & Betsy McGowen",spike,What am I supposed to do? I'm useless. No wonder my friends never need me to do anything important. They're the ones with superpowers. They've probably already figured out how to escape.
Power Ponies,"Meghan McCarthy, Charlotte Fullerton & Betsy McGowen",spike,Or not!
Power Ponies,"Meghan McCarthy, Charlotte Fullerton & Betsy McGowen",fluttershy,"Ahem. I don't mean to interrupt, but aren't you forgetting about somepony?"
Power Ponies,"Meghan McCarthy, Charlotte Fullerton & Betsy McGowen",twilight sparkle,"Maybe in your world. But in our world, Spike<U+0097> uh, Hum Drum always comes through when we need him! Always!"
Power Ponies,"Meghan McCarthy, Charlotte Fullerton & Betsy McGowen",spike,"I'm not like Hum Drum! When my friends really need me, I do come through! And they need me now!"
Power Ponies,"Meghan McCarthy, Charlotte Fullerton & Betsy McGowen",twilight sparkle,"Way to go, Spike!"
Power Ponies,"Meghan McCarthy, Charlotte Fullerton & Betsy McGowen",rainbow dash,Get mad!
Power Ponies,"Meghan McCarthy, Charlotte Fullerton & Betsy McGowen",pinkie pie,Tag you're it! Tag you're it! Tag you're it! Tag you're it!
Power Ponies,"Meghan McCarthy, Charlotte Fullerton & Betsy McGowen",rainbow dash,Need a place to put these guys!
Power Ponies,"Meghan McCarthy, Charlotte Fullerton & Betsy McGowen",applejack,"Hold it right there, partner!"
Power Ponies,"Meghan McCarthy, Charlotte Fullerton & Betsy McGowen",spike,"Fluttershy, where are you going?"
Power Ponies,"Meghan McCarthy, Charlotte Fullerton & Betsy McGowen",fluttershy,You seem to have everything under control.
Power Ponies,"Meghan McCarthy, Charlotte Fullerton & Betsy McGowen",spike,"Fluttershy, we need you! You have to power up!"
Power Ponies,"Meghan McCarthy, Charlotte Fullerton & Betsy McGowen",fluttershy,"I'm sorry, it's just that nothing is making me mad."
Power Ponies,"Meghan McCarthy, Charlotte Fullerton & Betsy McGowen",spike,"Once again, the day is saved by<U+0097>"
Power Ponies,"Meghan McCarthy, Charlotte Fullerton & Betsy McGowen",rainbow dash,Awesome!
Power Ponies,"Meghan McCarthy, Charlotte Fullerton & Betsy McGowen",applejack,Whoo-ee!
Power Ponies,"Meghan McCarthy, Charlotte Fullerton & Betsy McGowen",rainbow dash,Did you see how I was raining down a storm of justice at the end there?!
Power Ponies,"Meghan McCarthy, Charlotte Fullerton & Betsy McGowen",applejack,You catch how I was wieldin' that lasso?
Power Ponies,"Meghan McCarthy, Charlotte Fullerton & Betsy McGowen",pinkie pie,Cupcakes?
Power Ponies,"Meghan McCarthy, Charlotte Fullerton & Betsy McGowen",rarity,How did you<U+0097>
Power Ponies,"Meghan McCarthy, Charlotte Fullerton & Betsy McGowen",pinkie pie,"Eh, we had a good half second before we got sucked back out of the comic, and the Maretropolis bakery was only sixty-five blocks away!"
Power Ponies,"Meghan McCarthy, Charlotte Fullerton & Betsy McGowen",spike,I'm just glad to be back.
Power Ponies,"Meghan McCarthy, Charlotte Fullerton & Betsy McGowen",twilight sparkle,"We wouldn't have made it without you, Spike. And I hope you realize that just because we don't always need your help, it doesn't mean that we don't think you're helpful."
Power Ponies,"Meghan McCarthy, Charlotte Fullerton & Betsy McGowen",spike,And that you don't have to have superpowers to be a super friend.
Power Ponies,"Meghan McCarthy, Charlotte Fullerton & Betsy McGowen",twilight sparkle,But I do have one question. Where exactly did you get that comic book?
Power Ponies,"Meghan McCarthy, Charlotte Fullerton & Betsy McGowen",spike,"This one I got in Canterlot at the House of Enchanted Comics. Well, I didn't know it meant they were literally enchanted!"
Power Ponies,"Meghan McCarthy, Charlotte Fullerton & Betsy McGowen",spike,"I thought it just meant, like, the comics they sold there had really enchanting storylines! Hey, wait up! I'm an important part of this team, remember?!"
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,applejack,Any minute now...
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,applejack,What the heck is goin' on? [gasps] They're back!
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,applejack,Attention! This is a Sweet Apple Acres code red! I need all hooves <U+0096> and claws <U+0096> on deck!
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,rarity,"Calm down, Applejack."
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,applejack,Calm down?! How can I calm down at a time like this?! Vampire fruit bats are attackin' Sweet Apple Acres!
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,twilight sparkle,But I thought the fruit bats usually stayed put in the west orchard.
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,applejack,"The fruit bats do, but these aren't just your everyday ordinary fruit bats. They're vampire fruit bats! I'll be darned if they think they're gonna sink their fangs into my blue ribbon apple."
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,spike,Awesome!
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,applejack,This here's our entry into the Appleloosa State Fair's produce competition. [exhales] You know how much TLC goes into getting an apple to grow like this?
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,rarity,"Applejack! When you go big, you really go big!"
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,applejack,Them vampire bats want to shrivel it up like a raisin!
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,fluttershy,"Oh, I'm sure if we just let them know how special that particular apple is to you, they'll leave it alone."
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,applejack,"Yeah, right. Be my guest."
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,fluttershy,"Um, excuse me, Mr. Vampire Bat--"
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,fluttershy,We were just wondering if maybe you wouldn't mind leaving that really big apple alone?
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,applejack,Well? What'd he say?
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,fluttershy,Um... yes.
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,applejack,Huh?!
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,fluttershy,But... it could've been a no.
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,applejack,Oh.
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,fluttershy,"This is the first vampire fruit bat I've ever met and, well, it might take some time for me to really understand their language."
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,applejack,"Uh-huh. And in the meantime, this pest and his vermin friends are gonna go after my prized apple and, while they're at it, every other apple in the orchard! These vampire bats are nothin' but a bunch of monsters!"
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,fluttershy,"Monsters?! Oh, that's a bit harsh, don't you think?"
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,applejack,"No, I do not."
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,applejack,"Those vampire bats will give you a fright Eating apples both day and night They rest for a minute, maybe three Then they're eatin' every apple in your apple tree"
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,fluttershy,"Now wait just a minute, there's another side to this And if I did not defend them, then I would be remiss These bats are mamas and papas too They care for their young just like we ponies do"
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,applejack,"Oh, give me a break, you're bein' too kind These creatures have a one-track mind The orchard is not their restaurant But do they ever think what others may want? No! They don't! And that is just a fact These bats, they simply don't know how to act"
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,fluttershy,That's where I have to disagree They're loyal to their family Spreading seeds both far and wide
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,applejack,"You see one comin', you'd better run and hide! They're big and ugly and mean as sin Will ya look at the state my trees are in?"
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,fluttershy,"They help your trees, they'll grow stronger faster"
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,applejack,They've turned my life to a total disaster!
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,rarity,"Well, I for one don't have a doubt These vermin must be stamped right out"
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,"I second that, they've got to go These bats, they've got to hit the road"
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,applejack,"It comes down to just one simple fact They've crossed the line, it's time to fight them back!"
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,applejack,"Yes, it comes down to just one simple fact They've crossed the line, it's time that we attack!"
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,rarity,"I'm sorry, Fluttershy, but I believe Applejack has made the better argument. These vampire fruit bats sound downright dreadful."
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,applejack,So let's get to roundin' them up so they don't destroy the rest of my orchard.
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,pinkie pie,"[to the tune of Winter Wrap Up] Fruit bat round-up, fruit bat round-up!"
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,fluttershy,"Um, excuse me, but, um, what if instead of rounding them up, we... let them have part of the orchard?"
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,applejack,[whinny] Have you lost your pest-lovin' mind?!
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,fluttershy,"They're only here because they're hungry! If we build a sanctuary for them, they could have their own apples to enjoy! After a while, they could even help the rest of your orchard! The vampire bats don't eat the seeds of the apples, and when they spit them out, they grow into even more productive apple trees!"
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,applejack,"Listen, Fluttershy. That sounds real nice 'n' all, but every second we spend buildin' this so-called 'sanctuary' is a second they'll spend destroyin' orchards! You don't know what it was like the last time there was an infestation, but Granny Smith has told me enough stories about it that just the thought of it gives me nightmares! [narrating] Granny says we lost a huge section of orchard that year. They had to ration out apples all winter!"
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,"What about the cider? There was still cider, right?"
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,applejack,Not...a...drop.
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,"No cider?! No cider?! We need to round up these monsters, and we need to do it now!"
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,applejack,"If Granny Smith wasn't with Apple Bloom an' Big Mac checkin' out our produce competition in Appleloosa, she'd be here tellin' us to do just that!"
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,twilight sparkle,"I'm sorry, Fluttershy, but I think Applejack is right. I just wish there was another way we could convince them not to eat them in the first place. Maybe there is...!"
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,twilight sparkle,"So, there's good news and bad news. The good news is that I found a spell that can get the vampire fruit bats to stop wanting to suck the juice from the apples. But in order for the spell to work, I need the bats' full and complete attention."
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,fluttershy,[gasps] Oh no.
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,twilight sparkle,"Fluttershy, I need you to do your Stare on the bats."
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,fluttershy,"Oh, gosh, I don't know."
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,What's the problem? You've used the Stare plenty of times before!
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,fluttershy,"Yes, but it's not something I take lightly. I've made a vow not to use it except in dire circumstances."
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,applejack,This circumstance is plenty dire to me!
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,Me too! Think of the cider! Won't somepony please think of the cider?!
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,fluttershy,I'm sorry. I just don't like the idea of taking away the thing that really makes the vampire fruit bats [inhales] vampire fruit bats! It just feels wrong!
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,twilight sparkle,"But if we don't do this, there won't be any apples left for anypony here in Ponyville. Doesn't that feel wrong, too?"
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,applejack,"So what's it gonna be, Fluttershy? Will you do your Stare on the bats or not?"
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,fluttershy,"Um... Um... Okay, I'll do it."
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,fluttershy,They're not icky.
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,First round of cider's on me!
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,applejack,Hold it right there! We've gotta round up these beasts with wings first. Time's a-wastin'!
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,rarity,"[muffled] [yelps] Ew, ew, ew, ewwww!"
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,Gotcha!
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,applejack,"Good work, everypony! I think we got 'em all! [to Fluttershy] Now all we need is for you do to your Stare."
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,fluttershy,"Oh, um, are you sure I really need-- Okay. I really, really, really hate to do this to you... I just hope you can forgive me..."
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,applejack,"Good... Now you go, Twilight!"
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,twilight sparkle,Alright.
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,twilight sparkle,"You can stop staring, Fluttershy."
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,spike,Did it work?
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,applejack,Only one way to find out for sure.
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,"Ye-he-heah, whoo!"
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,applejack,My crop is saved! Yee-haw!
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,We'll be drinking cider all winter long!
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,applejack,I wanna thank you for your help. I couldn't have done it without you.
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,spike,"Aw, don't mention it, Applejack. It was my pleasure! Really!"
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,applejack,Now all we gotta do is sweep up these cores so I can start buckin' fresh tomorrow mornin'!
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,applejack,"Apple Bucking Day, take two!"
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,twilight sparkle,The spell didn't work!
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,applejack,You're darn tootin' the spell didn't work! I think we're gonna have to take more extreme measures!
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,"I hear ya, Applejack! C'mon, everypony! Let's track down those vampire bats!"
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,applejack,Wait a minute... I don't think these bats are the ones that sucked my apples dry.
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,rarity,But if the vampire bats aren't eating your apples...
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,twilight sparkle,"Who is? Fluttershy, you're our animal expert. Do you know of any other creature that might be capable of this?"
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,fluttershy,I'm sorry. I don't.
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,twilight sparkle,"Well, there's only one way to find out. We'll have to catch whoever it is in the act."
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,rarity,And how do you propose we do that?
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,twilight sparkle,A stakeout...!
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,[spookily] The witching hour...
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,rarity,"Oh, Fluttershy, it'll be okay. Don't forget, darling, we're all in this together."
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,twilight sparkle,That's right. Nopony leaves this orchard until we've solved this mystery. Agreed?
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,applejack,"Does everypony have their pony signals? Now remember, Pinkie Pie, only use the signal if you see somethin' suspicious."
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,pinkie pie,I got it. Something suspicious...
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,pinkie pie,Whatcha doin'?!
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,applejack,"Alright, now everypony split up. We'll each patrol our own row of the orchard. Whoever or whatever's destroyin' my apples has gotta be here somewhere."
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,pinkie pie,What was that?! [gasps] Suspicious! [giggles] It's pony signal time!
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,rarity,"Who's there? Oh, well, there's obviously no need to worry about that shadowy figure overhead... [frightened] Or maybe there is! I think I'll just go see how Rainbow Dash is doing..."
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,"Uh... who's there? Answer me or you'll regret it! Fine, have it your own way! Take that, you, you, you... scarecrow... Oh."
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,twilight sparkle,"Applejack, what is it?"
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,pinkie pie,Suspicious!
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,pinkie pie,Fluttershy? Yoo-hoo! Fluttershy!
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,rarity,That's not Fluttershy... That's Flutterbat!
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,twilight sparkle,We've gotta get her down from there!
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,rarity,"Uh... Fluttershy, sweetness, please come down, and... do stop being a vampire bat."
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,"Fluttershy! It's me, Rainbow Dash! Why don't you cut the bat act and come on down?!"
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,[yelps] Whoa! Maybe we should just let her come down when she's ready.
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,pinkie pie,Flutterbat on the loose! Run for your lives!
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,twilight sparkle,"Pinkie Pie, calm down! See? She's back on her... branch."
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,pinkie pie,She's just biding her time! Waiting for the right moment to pounce!
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,applejack,"Pinkie Pie, bats don't eat ponies. Not even vampire bats."
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,pinkie pie,But maybe vampire ponies eat other ponies! I'm not taking any chances!
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,rarity,How did this happen? That's what I don't understand.
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,twilight sparkle,I think this was actually our fault.
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,Our fault?
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,applejack,And how'd you figure that?
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,twilight sparkle,"Okay, so this is me, these are the bats, and this is Fluttershy doing her Stare. The spell was supposed to go right onto the bats like this, but somehow the spell must have backfired. It took the vampire fruit bats' desire to be vampire fruit bats and transferred that desire into Fluttershy. C'mon! We'll reverse the spell and make it right!"
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,pinkie pie,Then what are we waiting for? Let's save Fluttershy before that thing eats us all!
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,Hit the deck!
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,pinkie pie,Follow that bat!
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,rarity,I can't believe we lost her!
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,twilight sparkle,"Oh, Fluttershy, where are you?"
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,applejack,Look out! Whoa!
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,"If she keeps this up, your whole crop will be gone in no time!"
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,applejack,That's the least of my worries. I just want my friend back.
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,twilight sparkle,We'll never get her back unless we corner her and catch her so I can reverse the spell!
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,twilight sparkle,[hushed] There she is!
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,applejack,There she goes!
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,twilight sparkle,"Oh, this is no use. I think the only way we're gonna catch her is if we find a way to lure her closer to us."
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,applejack,"But even if we can lure her to us, how're we gonna get her to stay still long enough for you to do your reverse spell?"
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,pinkie pie,"Aww, if only we had Fluttershy to do her Stare on the Flutterbat."
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,twilight sparkle,[gasps] That's it!
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,twilight sparkle,"Okay, let's get our friend back. Action stations!"
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,"So much for having the winning apple in the Appleloosa State Fair, huh?"
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,[hushed] She's coming!
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,fluttershy,Oh... where am I?
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,applejack,Thank goodness you're okay!
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,fluttershy,But... what happened to me?
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,pinkie pie,You turned into a vampire pony!
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,fluttershy,[gasps] I tried to eat ponies?!
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,pinkie pie,Of course not!
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,fluttershy,So I wasn't a vampire?
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,pinkie pie,Yes!
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,fluttershy,"Yes I was, or yes I wasn't?"
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,pinkie pie,"Yes, you were!"
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,fluttershy,But I didn't try and eat ponies?
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,pinkie pie,Yes!
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,fluttershy,I did?!
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,pinkie pie,No!
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,fluttershy,I'm confused...
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,rarity,Me too... and I was there!
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,applejack,"Fluttershy, I'm real sorry I didn't take your suggestion in the first place."
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,fluttershy,"And don't forget, now you'll get seeds that will grow into even bigger and better apple trees."
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,Does that mean what I think it means?
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,applejack,Yup! More cider too.
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,rainbow dash,"Yea-he-heah, whoo!"
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,spike,"Okay, got the part about the spell, Fluttershy turning into a bat, building a sanctuary..."
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,applejack,Be sure to put in there that I came to see that my short-term solution was a little short-sighted.
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,fluttershy,And that you shouldn't let anypony pressure you into doing something that you don't think is right. Sometimes you have to tell even your closest friends 'no'.
Bats!,Merriwether Williams,applejack,"Now, how about we celebrate our stronger than ever friendship with a nice, ripe, juicy apple?"
Rarity Takes Manehattan,Dave Polsky,spike,"There you are, Rarity! That's the last of your bags."
Rarity Takes Manehattan,Dave Polsky,rarity,"Actually, Spike, I've got one last pile of bags, over there. Won't you be a dear?"
Rarity Takes Manehattan,Dave Polsky,rarity,"An entire week in the fabulous city of Manehattan! Plus, all of my very best friends there with me!"
Rarity Takes Manehattan,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"Of course we'd all come along to support you during Fashion Week, Rarity!"
Rarity Takes Manehattan,Dave Polsky,fluttershy,Not that you'll need it. We're sure you'll win.
Rarity Takes Manehattan,Dave Polsky,rarity,[squeals] I can't begin to tell you how excited I am that you'll all be there with me! However... Perhaps I can show you...
Rarity Takes Manehattan,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,What's that?
Rarity Takes Manehattan,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,"Ooh, ooh, ooh, I know! A paper fan!"
Rarity Takes Manehattan,Dave Polsky,rarity,"No, it's<U+0097>"
Rarity Takes Manehattan,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,"A magic trick! You know, where I pick a card and remember what it is and then you put it back in the deck so you can't look at it and<U+0097>"
Rarity Takes Manehattan,Dave Polsky,rarity,These are tickets to the hottest musical on Bridleway!
Rarity Takes Manehattan,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,You couldn't mean Hinny of the Hills... because that show's been sold out for months! Or could you?!
Rarity Takes Manehattan,Dave Polsky,rarity,I could. I do.
Rarity Takes Manehattan,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"[gasps] Oh, Rarity, you didn't have to do that, but... since you did..."
Rarity Takes Manehattan,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,This trip is fun already! I love jumping up and down! Whee-hee!
Rarity Takes Manehattan,Dave Polsky,rarity,"Come along, ponies! I found us a place to stay only a block from the train station in the very heart of this glorious metropolis!"
Rarity Takes Manehattan,Dave Polsky,applejack,"Hey, look! That's the theatre where Hinny of the Hills is playin'!"
Rarity Takes Manehattan,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"Wow, Rarity! How'd you manage to get us seats for tomorrow night?"
Rarity Takes Manehattan,Dave Polsky,rarity,"Oh, I gave some designs to the costume designer, so he pulled a few strings."
Rarity Takes Manehattan,Dave Polsky,rarity,"That is what makes Manehattan so splendid and amazing. You do something nice for somepony, and then you never know when they'll do something nice for you!"
Rarity Takes Manehattan,Dave Polsky,applejack,So then you can do something nice for us!
Rarity Takes Manehattan,Dave Polsky,fluttershy,Like get us in to see Hinny of the Hills!
Rarity Takes Manehattan,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,Which is only the best musical in all of Equestria!
Rarity Takes Manehattan,Dave Polsky,applejack,It must be good if Rainbow Dash is impressed. Normally she doesn't even like musicals.
Rarity Takes Manehattan,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,I know. Ponies just bursting into song in random places at the drop of a hat? Who does that?
Rarity Takes Manehattan,Dave Polsky,rarity,"Oh, Manehattan, what you do to me Such a huge bustling community And there's always opportunity To do the friendly thing"
Rarity Takes Manehattan,Dave Polsky,rarity,Only if you'll accept this gratuity first.
Rarity Takes Manehattan,Dave Polsky,rarity,Do keep it all. I insist!
Rarity Takes Manehattan,Dave Polsky,rarity,"Generosity, I'm here to show all that I can give Generosity, I'm here to set the bar Just sit back and watch how I live"
Rarity Takes Manehattan,Dave Polsky,rarity,After you.
Rarity Takes Manehattan,Dave Polsky,rarity,"Please, take mine."
Rarity Takes Manehattan,Dave Polsky,rarity,"Some may say, ""Rarity, Don't be so big-hearted and bold Treating strangers like they're friends This town's too big and cold"""
Rarity Takes Manehattan,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,"Oh, Manehattan, what you do to us"
Rarity Takes Manehattan,Dave Polsky,fluttershy,What if you find a Gloomy Gus?
Rarity Takes Manehattan,Dave Polsky,applejack,It's no intimidatin' thing
Rarity Takes Manehattan,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,Just be kind without a fuss
Rarity Takes Manehattan,Dave Polsky,rarity,"Generosity, I'm here to show all that I can do Generosity, you are the key Manehattan, I'm here just for you Just for you"
Rarity Takes Manehattan,Dave Polsky,rarity,"[sigh] To think my dresses could soon be displayed on the most glamorous shopping thoroughfare of the most glamorous city in Equestria! Oh, it would be my dream come true!"
Rarity Takes Manehattan,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,Is there anything left to do we can help you with?
Rarity Takes Manehattan,Dave Polsky,rarity,"Hm, nothing I can think of. The dresses are all completely finished, all made from a fabulous new fabric I've been developing for months. Stretchy, but not clingy. Shimmery, but not showy."
Rarity Takes Manehattan,Dave Polsky,fluttershy,Sounds amazing.
Rarity Takes Manehattan,Dave Polsky,rarity,There's nothing left for me to do but check in at the runway with my dresses by two this afternoon.
Rarity Takes Manehattan,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,"Oh, that's funny. Because that clock over there makes it seem like that's only ten minutes from now!"
Rarity Takes Manehattan,Dave Polsky,rarity,"Oh, my ribbons and threads. And the runway ballroom is all the way across town! If I don't get there, I'm disqualified! Taaaaxiii!"
Rarity Takes Manehattan,Dave Polsky,fluttershy,"Oh, no! We've gotta help her find a cab, now!"
Rarity Takes Manehattan,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,"I'm on it! Hey, buddy! Is this cab taken?"
Rarity Takes Manehattan,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,Huh? What? Does everypony in this town want a cab?
Rarity Takes Manehattan,Dave Polsky,rarity,I'm afraid getting a taxi at this time could prove almost impossible!
Rarity Takes Manehattan,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,Please won't you let her have this taxi? She has somewhere very important to be right away!
Rarity Takes Manehattan,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"Oh, it's no use! The cab drivers just drive right past to get to the next pony in line!"
Rarity Takes Manehattan,Dave Polsky,rarity,Fashion runway plaza in seven minutes. Can you make it?
Rarity Takes Manehattan,Dave Polsky,rarity,Ta-ta!
Rarity Takes Manehattan,Dave Polsky,spike,"Whew, that was close."
Rarity Takes Manehattan,Dave Polsky,spike,Anypony else got a sneaking suspicion we're forgetting something?
Rarity Takes Manehattan,Dave Polsky,rarity,"[out of breath, quickly] Good afternoon, I'm here for Fashion Week!"
Rarity Takes Manehattan,Dave Polsky,rarity,My<U+0096> My dresses! How could I possibly forget them?! [gasps] I'm dooooomed!
Rarity Takes Manehattan,Dave Polsky,rarity,You're a lifesaver!
Rarity Takes Manehattan,Dave Polsky,rarity,"[sighs] I made it! And with seconds to spare! Hello, everypony. Pleased to meet you all."
Rarity Takes Manehattan,Dave Polsky,rarity,"You must be Prim Hemline, the host of this grand event. How do you<U+0097>?"
Rarity Takes Manehattan,Dave Polsky,rarity,"Uhhhh... [chuckles nervously] Just... lucky, I guess."
Rarity Takes Manehattan,Dave Polsky,rarity,"Me too, but everything just seems to keep working out!"
Rarity Takes Manehattan,Dave Polsky,rarity,"Oh, yes, of course, of course! I<U+0096> I thought you looked familiar, but I couldn't place it. You haven't been back in years!"
Rarity Takes Manehattan,Dave Polsky,rarity,"Oh, good for you, Sur<U+0097>"
Rarity Takes Manehattan,Dave Polsky,rarity,"Yes, yes. Well, good luck!"
Rarity Takes Manehattan,Dave Polsky,rarity,"Why, thank you so much!"
Rarity Takes Manehattan,Dave Polsky,rarity,"Oh now, I'm sure your collection is equally lovely, if not more so!"
Rarity Takes Manehattan,Dave Polsky,rarity,"Oh, not at all! Here, I have loads extra."
Rarity Takes Manehattan,Dave Polsky,rarity,"Positive! Oh, well, it's been wonderful getting caught up, and I don't wish to be rude, but I must finish my preparations and I am a bit late as it... is?"
Rarity Takes Manehattan,Dave Polsky,rarity,"Hello! I'm here half an hour early for my run-through appointment, just the way Prim likes!"
Rarity Takes Manehattan,Dave Polsky,rarity,"Oh, why, yes. It's stretchy, but not clingy. Shimmery<U+0097>"
Rarity Takes Manehattan,Dave Polsky,rarity,You stole my fabric!
Rarity Takes Manehattan,Dave Polsky,rarity,I gave you the fabric for accents! Not for your whole line! And how could you possibly make all of those outfits out of it so fast?!
Rarity Takes Manehattan,Dave Polsky,rarity,[gasps] How could this happen?
Rarity Takes Manehattan,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"Oh, my gosh, what a great afternoon! That was almost too much fun!"
Rarity Takes Manehattan,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,"Better pace yourself, 'cause the rest of the day is jam-packed!"
Rarity Takes Manehattan,Dave Polsky,applejack,First there's the salon appointment to get our manes done.
Rarity Takes Manehattan,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,Then our fancy dinner at the Far-Afield Tavern!
Rarity Takes Manehattan,Dave Polsky,fluttershy,And after that...
Rarity Takes Manehattan,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,Is... everything okay?
Rarity Takes Manehattan,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,"You got the dresses the bellhop brought you and everything, right?"
Rarity Takes Manehattan,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,But he said he brought them.
Rarity Takes Manehattan,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"Now, Rarity, whatever went wrong, we're all here to help you get through it, no matter what it takes."
Rarity Takes Manehattan,Dave Polsky,applejack,"Come on, Rarity, buck up! All we need is some fabric and you'll be back in business!"
Rarity Takes Manehattan,Dave Polsky,rarity,"[gasps] This new line is going to be marvelous! Perhaps even better than the last! It's daring, it's bold! Perhaps I still have a chance after all!"
Rarity Takes Manehattan,Dave Polsky,rarity,Twilight! Sew these pieces together according to that pattern there!
Rarity Takes Manehattan,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"You said if we skipped dinner at the Far-Afield Tavern, you'd order a meal for us while we keep working."
Rarity Takes Manehattan,Dave Polsky,rarity,"Don't fret. It'll be here in an hour. That's not going to be a problem, is it?"
Rarity Takes Manehattan,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,"Well, we're supposed to be watching Hinny of the Hills by then..."
Rarity Takes Manehattan,Dave Polsky,rarity,"Oh! I see! I go out of my way to get you tickets for a show, and this is how you repay me? By abandoning me in my hour of need? Oh, oh, oh! Fine! Go and see Hinny of the Hills tonight! And then tomorrow morning when you come to see my fashion show without any fashion to show, you can have more entertainment! ""Oh, why look, there's our friend Rarity going down in flames! Isn't friendship magic?!"""
Rarity Takes Manehattan,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"Rarity, calm down. What's gotten into you?"
Rarity Takes Manehattan,Dave Polsky,rarity,"What's gotten into you?! Oh, go ahead! See your little show! Congratu-pony-lations, fillies! Sounds like you've all figured out already it's everypony for herself in this town!"
Rarity Takes Manehattan,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,There. That's the last of them.
Rarity Takes Manehattan,Dave Polsky,rarity,[gasps] Finally!
Rarity Takes Manehattan,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,You're welcome!
Rarity Takes Manehattan,Dave Polsky,rarity,"Oh! They're liking it! I think I may have just won this thing! Oh, I can't wait to celebrate with... My friends. They didn't come. What have I done?"
Rarity Takes Manehattan,Dave Polsky,rarity,I have to go.
Rarity Takes Manehattan,Dave Polsky,rarity,No time to talk. I have to find my friends!
Rarity Takes Manehattan,Dave Polsky,rarity,"Oh, no! Back to Ponyville, I imagine. Oh, they worked so hard on my behalf! And I repaid them with unkindness. What have I done?! Oh... here you are."
Rarity Takes Manehattan,Dave Polsky,rarity,"Oh, Manehattan, what have I done? The thought of Fashion Week was fun But I went way too far My friends gave to me in ways so kind And I gave them nothing but a hard time"
Rarity Takes Manehattan,Dave Polsky,rarity,"I need a moment with Prim Hemline. I have to rush back to Ponyville, but I just wanted to thank her first for<U+0097>"
Rarity Takes Manehattan,Dave Polsky,rarity,"There you all are! I can't believe it, I thought you went back home!"
Rarity Takes Manehattan,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,We missed the show because we overslept. Suri told us you lost. I'm really sorry.
Rarity Takes Manehattan,Dave Polsky,rarity,I lost? You know what? I don't even care. I'm just happy you're all still here after how I treated you. Taking advantage of your friendship the way I did. How could you ever see past it?
Rarity Takes Manehattan,Dave Polsky,applejack,"Yeah, you were pretty rotten."
Rarity Takes Manehattan,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,"Wow, Applejack. I know your thing is honesty, but come on!"
Rarity Takes Manehattan,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"Last night we may not have seen you at your best, but we know you. And we would never let one thing like that change how we feel about you."
Rarity Takes Manehattan,Dave Polsky,rarity,"Oh, thank you! You really are the most wonderful friends a pony could have! You know, I already arranged to make it up to you this afternoon! Hope you're all available for an exclusive performance of Hinny of the Hills!"
Rarity Takes Manehattan,Dave Polsky,applejack,Wow! That was even better than I imagined!
Rarity Takes Manehattan,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,"I loved it! [beat] Uh, I mean, it was a'ight."
Rarity Takes Manehattan,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,How did you ever get them to agree to do an extra performance just for us?
Rarity Takes Manehattan,Dave Polsky,rarity,"Remember my costume designer friend who got me the tickets? Well, I offered to make all the costumes for his next show!"
Rarity Takes Manehattan,Dave Polsky,fluttershy,"Um, here in Manehattan?"
Rarity Takes Manehattan,Dave Polsky,rarity,"Well, um... yes... it will keep me away from Ponyville for a while."
Rarity Takes Manehattan,Dave Polsky,rarity,But I so wanted you to see this show! And working for this designer is such a great opportunity!
Rarity Takes Manehattan,Dave Polsky,applejack,"We know. We're happy for you, Rarity. We're just sad for us."
Rarity Takes Manehattan,Dave Polsky,rarity,Sure. Come on down. This is the first place trophy for Fashion Week. [gasps] With my name on it! But I thought I lost!
Rarity Takes Manehattan,Dave Polsky,rarity,Hm. I suppose you'll need a job now that you're no longer with Suri. How would you like to work for my friend making all the costumes for his next show?
Rarity Takes Manehattan,Dave Polsky,rarity,"Manehattan was simply grand. It was in this magnificent metropolis that I learned that, while there are ponies who will take advantage of your generosity, you should never, ever let that cause you to abandon your generous spirit. Nothing feels worse than taking advantage of the giving nature of your friends."
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,pinkie pie,Whatcha doin'?
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,twilight sparkle,Aaagh!
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,twilight sparkle,Just some genealogical research.
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,pinkie pie,Ohhh. [whispering] I don't know what that is.
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,spike,"Genealogy is the study of family history. Y'know, where ponies come from and who they're related to."
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,pinkie pie,"Ooh, fascinating."
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,twilight sparkle,Maybe you should pick one from the... top?
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,pinkie pie,"Uh-huh... Interesting... I see... Hmm, that makes sense... Not much of a surprise there... WHAT?!? This is the most amazing thing ever! Why didn't you tell me how amazing this is?! Genealogy is better than cotton candy on top of a fountain of chocolate! [thud] You'll never believe who it says I'm related to!"
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,pinkie pie,"Hey, cousin!"
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,applejack,"This is just so excitin', I can hardly believe it!"
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,pinkie pie,I know! Isn't it the best?
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,apple bloom,I have another sister! I have another sister!
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,pinkie pie,"Well, you actually have a fourth cousin twice removed by a fifth cousin, but that's like exactly like a sister!"
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,applejack,"I'd try to tone it down a little around non-family members, because I don't want to make them jealous, but..."
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,apple bloom,This is the best family ever!
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,applejack,"It really is. You are gonna love bein' an Apple. I mean, you've got the playful one..."
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,applejack,The strong one...
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,big mcintosh,Eeyup.
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,applejack,"And of course, there's Granny Smith, who knows everythin' about everythin'!"
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,granny smith,A Ponyville snail can hibernate for up to forty-eight moons!
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,pinkie pie,Who knew?
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,applejack,"And then there's me. [sniffs, exhales] Do you smell that sweet apple air, Pinkie Pie?"
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,applejack,That was rhetorical. Of course you smell it. You're an Apple now!
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,apple bloom,And Applejack is the one responsible for it!
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,applejack,"Aw, Apple Bloom, that is sweet, but--"
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,apple bloom,It's true! I mean she keeps us all organized and on schedule and does her own part on top of it all!
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,pinkie pie,I was already super happy as a Pie! And now I get to be a part of this amazing family too?
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,apple bloom,"It's even more amazin' now that you're in it! [rhythmically] We're family, we're family, you an' me are family!"
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,pinkie pie,Best family twirl everrrrrrr!
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,applejack,"Huh, I just can't believe we've never heard anythin' about this before! Hmm..."
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,apple bloom,"What's wrong, sis?"
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,applejack,I'm not seein' where exactly it says we're family.
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,pinkie pie,It's riiiiiiiii- [inhales] -iiiiiight here!
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,applejack,It... is?
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,pinkie pie,Uh-huh. Applesauce of the Apple family lineage is a fourth cousin twice removed of the Pie family!
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,applejack,"I see the part about our great, great auntie Applesauce and fourth cousin twice removed part, but that last bit's awful smudged. Are you sure it says 'Pie'?"
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,pinkie pie,"I guess it is a little smudged, but I see most of it there, and when I read it, I knew in my heart it was true!"
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,granny smith,"Well, ain't that just the sweetest thing!"
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,applejack,"It is, it is. I'd just hate for us to get all excited before we found out for sure."
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,apple bloom,So how are we supposed to find out for sure?
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,granny smith,"Ehhhh... Oh! Cousin Goldie Delicious! Her cabin's practically an Apple family history museum! If anypony has the records to back up Pinkie's theory, it's her!"
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,applejack,"Huh, I suppose we could always... I mean, Goldie Delicious doesn't live that far away, and we haven't been on one as a family in a real long time... Are y'all thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?"
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,granny smith,Has anypony seen my travelin' bonnet?
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,apple bloom,Isn't that it on your head?
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,granny smith,No!
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,apple bloom,It looks an awful lot like--
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,granny smith,"Well, it ain't, and that's final!"
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,applejack,"Hey, everypony? Since Pinkie Pie's back home gettin' her stuff for the trip, can y'all gather round? I just wanted to say somethin' real quick."
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,granny smith,"I've had somethin' in my teeth this whole time, haven't I? Gadsnickety, what a way to welcome a family member!"
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,applejack,"Er, no, Granny, your teeth are fine. I just wanted to be sure that we're all on the same page about showin' Pinkie Pie how awesome a family we really are. We want her to get to know the family she's been born into, but, like, the best version of it, y'know?"
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,granny smith,"Oh, [blows raspberry]. Don't you worry, honey. We're a great family, and she can't help but see it."
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,apple bloom,I'll bet my future cutie mark's gonna be a picture of me bein' the best behaved pony ever! That's how good I'm gonna be! Big Mac?
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,big mcintosh,Eeyup.
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,pinkie pie,Are y'all ready to go? Because I'm ready to go-go-go!
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,applejack,"Er, Big Mac? Are you sure we really need all that stuff?"
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,big mcintosh,Eeyup.
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,applejack,Are you sure you're strong enough to really pull all that stuff?
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,big mcintosh,Eeyup.
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,applejack,Are you sure the wagon's strong enough to hold it all?
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,big mcintosh,[groans] Eeyup!
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,applejack,Then lets get this show on the road!
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,applejack,"C'mon, Apples, y'all know this one!"
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,granny smith,Hot-diggity!
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,applejack,Yee-haw!
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,big mcintosh,Eeyup.
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,applejack,We've traveled the road of generations Joined by a common bond We sing our song 'cross the pony nation From Equestria and beyond
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,big mcintosh,Eeyup.
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,apple bloom,There's no place that I'd rather be Than travelin' with my family Friends all around come to join and see As we sing out across the land
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,big mcintosh,Eeyup.
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,granny smith,"We're peas in a pod, we're thick as thieves Any clich<e9> you can throw at me We're here for each other, through thick and thin You're always welcome with your Apple kin Wheeeeee!"
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,pinkie pie,"You're more fun than the color pink Or balloons flying over your favorite drink The love I feel here is swim, not sink As we party across this land"
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,big mcintosh,Eeyup!
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,applejack,"Big Mac! I thought you said<U+0096> Uh, I thought<U+0096> I mean, not that I'm blamin' you, because we don't blame in this family, but I thought you said all this stuff wasn't gonna be too heavy."
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,apple bloom,How're we supposed to get to Goldie Delicious now?
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,granny smith,"I don't know, but I don't see how we can go back now either. We're closer to cousin Goldie's that we are to home."
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,pinkie pie,[gasps] I have the best... idea... ever! Family river trip!
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,applejack,Heh. Just one problem. We haven't got a raft. [under her breath] 'Bout the only thing that didn't get packed.
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,granny smith,"Well, back in the old days, we used to use the sap from a sugar pine tree to glue things together."
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,applejack,"That is, uh, fascinatin'... Don't know that it's helpful, but it is fascinatin'..."
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,granny smith,"Pfft! 'Not helpful', my patootie! We're gonna build ourselves a raft out of these here jalopy parts and keep it held together with sugar pine sap!"
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,applejack,"Hm, worth a shot!"
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,pinkie pie,Woo-hoo!
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,applejack,"Could be worse, I guess. Now remember, this time we're only packin' the necessities."
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,pinkie pie,Wait a second!
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,pinkie pie,This one is for the scrapbook!
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,applejack,"Pinkie Pie, when did you have time to make this?"
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,pinkie pie,"Applejack, when you're family, you make the time."
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,applejack,Woo-hoo! We did it!
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,pinkie pie,Say 'soaked'!
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,pinkie pie,"So what you're saying is, if I have the courage to jump, the parachute will open."
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,big mcintosh,Eeyup.
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,pinkie pie,Whoa! That is deep!
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,big mcintosh,Eeyup.
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,applejack,"Uh-oh... All right, y'all. Please tell me that the map didn' get wet. 'Cuz it looks like I'm gonna need it right about now."
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,apple bloom,"Found it! Who's got the map? I got the map! M to the A to the yeah, that's right, P Ain't no other pony found a map like me I'm Applel<U+0097>"
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,applejack,"[through gritted teeth] All you had to do was bring it to me. No singin', no dancin', no games. Just walk it over!"
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,big mcintosh,[through gritted teeth] Eeyup.
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,pinkie pie,Say 'best siblings ever'!
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,pinkie pie,"Ooh, that's another keeper!"
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,granny smith,"It's okay, y'all! I travelled down this river as a filly and I know it like the back of my hoof!"
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,applejack,Are you sure you know which way to go?
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,granny smith,Does a June bug like to hide in a tree?
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,applejack,Uh... I don't know.
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,granny smith,"Well, I do know! And I also know we wanna head southeast! Now step aside, young'un!"
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,applejack,"Um, Granny?"
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,granny smith,Myuh-huh?
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,applejack,Are we supposed to go through a cave?
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,granny smith,"Ah, don't worry, child! The scariest cave in Equestria was down that other way!"
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,apple bloom,The scariest cave in Equestria?
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,granny smith,"Oh, it's a fright all right! Filled with creatures that'll eat ya soon as look at ya!"
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,pinkie pie,"Ooh, sounds scary. Tell us more!"
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,granny smith,Ponies go in... but they never come out!
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,applejack,And you're sure it's not that cave? The one we're headin' straight for?
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,granny smith,"Now, Applejack, I taught you better than to question your elder ponies!"
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,applejack,Heh... you sure did.
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,granny smith,Alrighty then. Now everypony just sit on back an' leave the steerin' to your old Granny Smith.
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,granny smith,See now? Told ya th--
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,pinkie pie,Got it! Best scary unidentifiable creature ever! Say 'terrified'!
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,granny smith,"Guess that was the scariest cave in Equestria. Uh, of course I meant to take us through it! Unexpected adventure is good for the soul!"
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,pinkie pie,Best granny wisdom ever!
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,applejack,"Uh-huh. Why don't you just scooch on over there, Granny? Think I'll take it from here on out."
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,granny smith,Huh! Is that how I taught you to treat your elder ponies?
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,pinkie pie,Ooh! Ooh! Is it?
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,applejack,You taught me to trust my common sense. And my common sense says we should get to Goldie Delicious's cabin in one piece.
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,granny smith,And that is exactly what I'm gonna do!
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,applejack,"That is mighty generous of you, but I think you've done enough for one day."
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,granny smith,And how exactly are you gonna know which way to go?
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,pinkie pie,Hmmmmmmm?
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,applejack,It would be easier if the map hadn't gone overboard!
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,apple bloom,Hey! There wouldn't have been an overboard if Big Mac hadn't overpacked the jalopy!
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,big mcintosh,Eeyu- hey!
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,applejack,"Exactly! So I think we can all agree that from here on out, I should be in charge of everythin'."
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,pinkie pie,"I just wanna say... that I think you're all super duper, and I can't wait to make a page in my scrapbook about the amazing waterfall we went down!"
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,pinkie pie,Wheeeee!
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,granny smith,Huh! Told you that sugar pine sap would hold this thing together.
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,applejack,"Uh, Pinkie Pie? Maybe you could read that one out loud?"
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,pinkie pie,"Oh, right, sorry! I haven't even read it yet. I was just looking at how pretty the paper is. Okay, it says that she ran off to run some errands but will be home soon! Oh, that's perfect!"
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,apple bloom,Why is that perfect?
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,pinkie pie,Because it'll give me enough time to get more scrapbook paper! See ya!
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,apple bloom,Worst family road trip. Ever.
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,big mcintosh,[sadly] Eeyup.
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,applejack,I can't believe she witnessed our family fallin' apart like this. [sighs] I can't believe I was arguin' with you so much that I tore the wheel right off the raft. It's like I wasn't myself at all.
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,granny smith,"Aw, that wasn't your fault. My stubborn streak got a hold of me somethin' fierce. Should've let you take the wheel long a'fore that."
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,apple bloom,It was my fault the map got all wet...
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,big mcintosh,I was the pony who<U+0097>
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,granny smith,"Now, now, Big Mac, you gotta know we forgive you for packin' the jalopy so much that it collapsed. You was just as eager to please Pinkie Pie like the rest of us."
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,applejack,"Everypony, I think we have to let Pinkie Pie know that even if she does discover that she's an Apple, she does not have to feel obliged to consider herself one."
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,granny smith,Sure as applesauce.
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,pinkie pie,Are you kidding me?! You guys are the best family ever!
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,applejack,"How can you say that? We started out as one big unit, and now look at us."
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,pinkie pie,"Yeah! Now look at you! You're all here still in one big unit, loving each other and owning up to what went wrong! You never gave up, even when things got tough!"
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,apple bloom,She does make a pretty good point.
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,pinkie pie,"You aren't just family, you're best friends! And I wanna be an Apple more than ever!"
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,apple bloom,And we want you to be one too!
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,goldie delicious,Now that's how you run an errand.
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,pinkie pie,Hello!
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,goldie delicious,Hello yourself!
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,applejack,You must be Goldie Delicious. So nice to meet you.
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,goldie delicious,Uh-huh. And who exactly are you?
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,pinkie pie,We're Apples!
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,applejack,"Well, we think we're all Apples. But we need your help finding out if Pinkie Pie here is our fourth cousin twice removed."
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,goldie delicious,"Well why didn't you say so? If anypony can help solve this genealogy mystery, it's me!"
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,goldie delicious,"Gotta... get some oil... for the hinges... Alrighty then, just have to move a few things out of the way of the door. Ooh! Ah! Get off of that, Mr. Fluffy... Come on, Pooples... Come here, sweetheart... Come on in! Sorry about the mess!"
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,applejack,Whoa!
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,goldie delicious,"Oh, careful now. Those belonged to your great-great-great-great uncle Apple Tart!"
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,apple bloom,"Well, whose was this?"
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,goldie delicious,"Well, that was my lunch. A couple of weeks ago."
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,goldie delicious,"[blows dust away] [straining] This here is a complete record of, of our family tree! It's not here, or here, or, or here, or it certainly isn't here, is it...? Oh, here it is! ...Oh, dear."
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,granny smith,"'Oh, dear'? What is it?"
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,pinkie pie,Am I not an Apple after all?
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,goldie delicious,"Well, that's just it. I don't know. The page is all smudged. I sure am sorry, but I don't think I can help you out after all."
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,pinkie pie,"Don't be sorry, it's okay. I'm just a little disappointed that I'll never know for sure if I'm a part of this family."
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,applejack,"Well, I know for sure!"
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,pinkie pie,What do you mean? You can't know!
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,applejack,"I can know for sure that it doesn't matter what the book says or doesn't say. After all you've been through with us and all you've put up with, it's obvious you're an Apple to the core!"
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,granny smith,Darn tootin'!
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,apple bloom,Yes siree!
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,big mcintosh,Eeyup!
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,pinkie pie,Ooh! Say 'best family hug ever'!
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,applejack,"Thanks again for the wagon, Goldie! We'll see you soon!"
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,goldie delicious,Y'all sure you don't want to take any of these Apple family heirlooms home with you?
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,big mcintosh,Nnope.
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,big mcintosh,Eeyup!
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,applejack,Twilight agreed this was definitely an experience worth puttin' in the journal. Think I'll write about how bein' a good family isn't about bein' perfect as much as it is about bein' able to get through the rough patches together. About bein' able to forgive each other for mistakes.
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,apple bloom,Don't forget to mention how really good friends can also feel like your family.
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,big mcintosh,Eeyup.
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,apple bloom,You know what? Maybe I should write it. I'm good at makin' things sound excitin'.
Pinkie Apple Pie,Natasha Levinger,granny smith,I have a history of excellent storytellin'. I should probably do it<U+0097> Hey! Where in the haystack do you think you're goin' with that there pen?!
Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,rainbow dash,"Alright, ponies, listen up!"
Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,fluttershy,"We're all ears. Right, Bulk Biceps?"
Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,bulk biceps,[kissing noises] [grunts] Nuh-uh! I'm all muscles! Yeah!
Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,rainbow dash,"I like your attitude, Bulk Biceps, but it's gonna take more than muscles and Yeah!s to get us to the Equestria Games! We are the Aerial Relay team, and it's up to the three of us to make sure that we qualify at the tryouts. And do I need to remind you how much I - I mean, Ponyville, heh <U+0096> wants to qualify and make it to the Games?"
Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,fluttershy,"I remember. I really, really, really want to qualify for you and Ponyville."
Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,bulk biceps,Bring it on!
Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,pinkie pie,Gimme a 'P' for 'Ponyville'!
Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,pinkie pie,"[through megaphone] P, Ponyville!"
Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,bulk biceps,P!
Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,rainbow dash,Just make sure you have one ready for when we qualify for the Aerial Relay.
Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,bulk biceps,"And after that, for when we win gold medals in the Equestria Games!"
Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,applejack,"Not so fast! If you're gonna be good, you're gonna be better with some of my apple brown bettys in ya. They're perfect."
Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,pinkie pie,'P' is for 'perfect'!
Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,rainbow dash,"Alright, team! Show me what you got! Put some bend into those knees! Flap those wings! And I want to see all four hooves off the ground on the count of three! [beat] [quickly] One two three!"
Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,rainbow dash,Don't forget to breathe while you're up there!
Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,pinkie pie,"'P' is for, uhh... 'pain'?"
Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,twilight sparkle,Good luck! [to Rainbow Dash] It was nice of you to be part of the team that doesn't have... uh... the strongest flyers.
Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,rainbow dash,"Nothing nice about it. I know that I can pick up the slack for anypony. With me on the team, we'll qualify. I'm sure of it."
Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,twilight sparkle,Ponyville is very lucky to have you.
Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,rainbow dash,"Yeah, I'm pretty awesome."
Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,fluttershy,"[straining] [gasping] I am so proud to be representing Ponyville. [straining] Oh, it's such an honor to even try out for the Games. I just hope I don't let anypony down."
Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,bulk biceps,We'll make them proud!
Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,pinkie pie,'P' is for 'proud'! We're gonna be the best fans anypony has ever seen!
Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,rarity,"Ooh. Can't wait to see what everypony else is wearing, even though I am absolutely sure they won't be better than the Ponyville uniforms I'm designing for the Equestria Games."
Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,applejack,And we will make it to the Games once everypony carbo-loads on my apple brown bettys.
Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,pinkie pie,I can't wait!
Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,spitfire,And the game is on!
Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,soarin,"Hah, nice to see there's some real competition here!"
Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,rainbow dash,"[sighs] The Wonderbolts know a winner when they see one, and we'll be winners just as soon as we practice! Right team?"
Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,fluttershy,Right.
Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,bulk biceps,Yeah!
Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,twilight sparkle,"And, um, I'm with her! Hooray!"
Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,pinkie pie,[gasps] Where can I get pompoms like those?!
Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,rainbow dash,"So, do I need to remind you of what our goal is here?"
Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,bulk biceps,"Uh, maybe?"
Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,rainbow dash,"We want to qualify! We need to be one of the first four teams to cross the finish line! Bulk Biceps, you're the first flyer, so let me see you flap it!"
Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,rainbow dash,What the?
Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,applejack,"Sorry! Got the idea from them, but..."
Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,applejack,...It looks like they got better aim.
Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,rainbow dash,"Okay, the passing of the baton needs to be seamless. You shouldn't miss a wing beat or drop a hair in altitude! And whatever you do, don't let go of it!"
Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,fluttershy,"Are you really, really, really sure you're ready? I mean, I don't want to take it if you're not super sure."
Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,bulk biceps,Ready!
Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,rarity,Ponyville could do so much better. I'll be back with a freshly painted one in no time!
Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,rainbow dash,We were using that! And it's not like anypony else has color-coordinated horseshoes or anything!
Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,rainbow dash,[sighs] I guess some ponies do.
Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,twilight sparkle,Some ponies do what?
Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,rainbow dash,[sighs] Have a better chance of qualifying and going to the Equestria Games than others.
Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,rainbow dash,"Watch and learn. The Cloudsdales are Wonderbolts, and Wonderbolts are the best flyers there are. And my personal heroes. So, maybe you can learn something."
Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,rainbow dash,Please learn something?
Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,spitfire,I sure hope so.
Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,soarin,Whoa!
Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,soarin,Whooaaaa!
Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,soarin,Aaaaah! Help!
Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,rainbow dash,Gotcha!
Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,spitfire,As good as any Wonderbolt!
Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,fluttershy,"Oh, Rainbow Dash, I'm just so proud of you. You scooped Soarin out of the sky and brought him down to the ground and now, now he's okay. At least, I hope he's okay. [to Soarin] Are you okay?"
Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,soarin,"Uh, my wing hurts, but I-I'm sure it'll be okay by the competition."
Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,rainbow dash,"Ah, it was nothin'. But, if you feel like talking about how great I am, don't let me stop you!"
Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,bulk biceps,'P' is for Rainbow Dash!
Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,fluttershy,"[whispering] Um, 'Rainbow Dash' actually starts with an 'R'."
Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,bulk biceps,Never mind!
Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,rainbow dash,Tough break to lose a teammate right before the tryouts.
Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,spitfire,So that means you could fly with us.
Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,rainbow dash,Fly?
Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,spitfire,What do you say? Wanna be our third?
Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,rainbow dash,"Uh, I don't know. My team really needs me to be at my best in order to qualify. Don't wanna be too worn out by the time the race comes around."
Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,spitfire,We put you through some pretty intense workouts at the Wonderbolt Academy and you handled those just fine.
Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,rainbow dash,"Heh, I did kick some major tail at the Academy... but I don't know how my teammates will feel about me practicing with the competition."
Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,rainbow dash,"Alright, I'll do it."
Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,spitfire,"[chuckles] Wise decision, Rainbow Dash."
Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,rainbow dash,"Come on, Bulk Biceps, you can do it!"
Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,fluttershy,"Um... I'm ready to take the horseshoe, if you want me to."
Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,rainbow dash,Nnnngh...
Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,fluttershy,[yelps] Oof!
Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,rainbow dash,"You, uh, keep doing your wing-ups. I'm just gonna get some, uh, water."
Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,bulk biceps,[laughs] Yeah!
Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,rarity,Too much?
Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,twilight sparkle,"It's not easy practicing with two teams, is it?"
Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,rainbow dash,[spit-take] You... know? Does anypony else?
Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,twilight sparkle,No. They're too busy practicing to wonder why you keep disappearing.
Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,rainbow dash,"Well, I've seen the other teams practicing and we're still gonna qualify. I can fly fast enough to make up the distance."
Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,twilight sparkle,It just seems like one of the teams you're practicing with needs a little more help than the other one.
Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,rainbow dash,"But it's so much more fun working out with the winners than... um... the non-winners. Besides, Ponyville will still qualify."
Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,spitfire,"Rainbow Dash, you got a minute?"
Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,rainbow dash,"Uh, sure."
Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,spitfire,It looks like Soarin's wing won't heal in time for the trials. We want you to fly with us.
Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,bulk biceps,Ow!
Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,spitfire,"So, what's it gonna be?"
Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,rainbow dash,"Well, I..."
Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,spitfire,Take some time to think about it.
Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,rainbow dash,They want me to fly with them! It's like a dream come true!
Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,twilight sparkle,"If you fly for Cloudsdale, Pinkie Pie won't have anypony to cheer for. Rarity's uniforms will never be seen. And Applejack will have slaved over those apple brown bettys for nothing."
Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,rainbow dash,"Oh, but I really wanna fly with the best team! What would you do?"
Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,twilight sparkle,"I think this is a decision you have to make on your own. The race is tomorrow, so you'd better make it soon."
Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,rainbow dash,[exaggerated groaning] Woe is me! Oooh!
Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,fluttershy,What's happened?
Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,rainbow dash,"Urgh, I've hurt my hoof..."
Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,spitfire,All of them?
Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,rainbow dash,"I, uh, tripped on a-a foam hoof and landed on a... [mumbles, near unintelligible] pokey stick coming out of the ground..."
Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,pinkie pie,"[growls] If I get my hooves on that [matching unintelligible gibberish], it'll be in big trouble!"
Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,rainbow dash,There is no way I can fly now.
Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,fluttershy,Do you think you'll be better by tryouts?
Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,rainbow dash,[exaggerated groaning] I'll be lucky if I ever fly again! [sighs] I just need a little rest.
Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,fluttershy,"Oh, don't worry, Rainbow Dash. We'll take care of you... or, at least, somepony will. Like, a medic or-or a doctor, or a nurse."
Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,twilight sparkle,"So, the medic pony isn't sure what's wrong with you."
Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,rainbow dash,Everything! Absolutely everything!
Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,applejack,This'll cure everythin' that ails ya!
Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,rainbow dash,[with mouth full] Thank you. I couldn't have done that on my own.
Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,rarity,Nothing says 'get better' like a little medical pizazz! Silk slings and a glitter bandage?
Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,rainbow dash,That might help.
Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,fluttershy,And how is our patient doing?
Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,rainbow dash,I've been better.
Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,fluttershy,"We just wanted to let you know that we're so sorry you're hurt, but you shouldn't worry a bit about not being able to be in the tryouts. We'll be alright. We even have a replacement. We're so, so sorry that you can't compete. We all know how much you love to fly. And we promise-"
Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,bulk biceps,Cross our hearts!
Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,fluttershy,"...That if we qualify and make it to the Equestria Games and all win gold medals, you can have ours, because we know how much a gold medal means to you."
Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,rainbow dash,Thanks...
Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,twilight sparkle,[clears throat] I think Rainbow Dash might need to rest some more.
Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,applejack,Don't forget your bettys!
Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,twilight sparkle,"You know, choosing not to choose isn't really a decision."
Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,soarin,"You sure have nice friends. Nopony's been by to visit me. Eh, too busy practicing, I guess."
Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,rainbow dash,"Well, hopefully your wing will be better soon."
Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,soarin,"Oh, it's fine. I-I'm just keeping it warm in case my team wants me back."
Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,rainbow dash,"What do you mean, 'wants you back'? Spitfire and Fleetfoot told me that you were still too injured to fly!"
Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,soarin,"And they told me that they were worried I wouldn't be one hundred percent by the tryouts, so they were going with somepony else!"
Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,rainbow dash,"That somepony else was me! Until, uh, well, until I got hurt, that is."
Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,soarin,"So, [sighs] I guess we're all out of luck. Cloudsdale won't qualify without three fliers, and Ponyville won't qualify without you. Too bad..."
Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,twilight sparkle,"Even with Rainbow Dash's replacement, I don't think we're gonna qualify. No offense."
Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,pinkie pie,Gah! What am I gonna do with all these now?!
Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,applejack,"Uh, what were you gonna do with them before?"
Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,rarity,"[sighs] Maybe my Equestria Games uniforms will still be in style next year. I mean, I am pretty fashion-forward."
Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,twilight sparkle,Is that Rainbow Dash... walking?
Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,rainbow dash,"I-I feel great, because... I was never hurt in the first place."
Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,rainbow dash,"I faked my injury so that I wouldn't have to choose between flying for Ponyville or Cloudsdale. I wanted to fly with you both, and the decision was too hard!"
Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,fluttershy,"Oh, Rainbow Dash, you don't have to choose us. I know you love to win, and you should go with the team that surely will."
Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,rainbow dash,I know now who I should've been loyal to.
Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,spitfire,Good choice. Always stick with the winners.
Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,rainbow dash,"Ponyville. Because it's not just where I live, but it's where my friends are. The ponies who really care about me, whether I can help them win a race or not."
Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,spitfire,Are you sure that's the right decision?
Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,rainbow dash,"You lied to me about Soarin's wing just so you could get a better flyer! You may be a winning team, but you're still not the kind of team I wanna be a part of."
Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,spitfire,"Huh. Rainbow Dash, you are something. Saw it at the Academy, seeing it again here. We could learn a lot from a competitor like you."
Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,spitfire,Ready to fly?
Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,soarin,Really?
Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,spitfire,Never should've lied and tried to replace you to begin with.
Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,soarin,"[gasps] Go, Cloudsdale!"
Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,rainbow dash,"Come on, Ponyville relay team! We've got a race to get ready for!"
Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,bulk biceps,Yeah!
Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,soarin,"Come on, Ponyville! You can do it!"
Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,twilight sparkle,"Go, Fluttershy! Woo-hoo!"
Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,pinkie pie,"Woo-hoo! Go, Rainbow Dash!"
Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,bulk biceps,Yeah!
Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,pinkie pie,Woo-hoo!
Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,twilight sparkle,"Equestria Games, here we come!"
Rainbow Falls,Corey Powell,rainbow dash,"Oh, I can't deny it. I love to win! But if I ever gotta choose between winning and being loyal to my friends, I'm always gonna choose my friends. 'Cause as much as I love winning, I love them waaaaay more."
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,spike,Mail's here!
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,twilight sparkle,"Please be a yes, please be a yes, please be a yes... Yes! She can make it, she can make it!"
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,spike,"Going out on a limb here, but I'm guessing that Princess Cadance said she can come this weekend!"
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,twilight sparkle,I'm finally gonna get to spend some quality time with my sister-in-law! This is the best news ever!
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,fluttershy,"Um, so sorry for barging in like this... but I'm so excited, I just couldn't wait to tell somepony! The Equestrian Society for the Preservation of Rare Creatures have given me permission to observe the rarest, tiniest, most adorable magical creatures in all of Equestria <U+0096> the Breezies!"
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,twilight sparkle,"Wow, Fluttershy, that's fantastic!"
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,fluttershy,"Oh, it's not just fantastic; it just might be the best news ever!"
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,pinkie pie,I just got the most incredible mail anypony's ever received in all of recorded pony postal history! It's a flyer about a one-day sale on used patio furniture! Aah! Could this day get any better? Woo-hoo!
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,rarity,"Here's a wrap, in case it gets cold."
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,applejack,And I packed you a basket of nice fresh apples in case you get hungry.
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,twilight sparkle,Have a great time!
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,fluttershy,"Oh, I will. And I hope you have fun with Cadance."
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,fluttershy,"Goodbye! Goodbye, everypony!"
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,pinkie pie,"Fluttershy! I'll never forget youuuuuuu! [beat] Ooh, something floaty! La-la-la-la-la!"
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,twilight sparkle,"Oh, I'm a bit nervous about Cadance's visit!"
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,applejack,"What could you be nervous about, Twilight? Cadance just loves you to pieces!"
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,twilight sparkle,"I know, but I really want her visit to go without a hitch!"
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,pinkie pie,"Oh, why wouldn't it?"
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,twilight sparkle,"Well, the last three times we've seen each other haven't exactly been worry-free."
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,rarity,The fate of Equestria has hung in the balance during most of your visits with her.
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,twilight sparkle,Exactly. Cadance and I haven't really had a chance to just enjoy being friends again. Which is why it is so important that this visit be about the two of us having some real quality time together.
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,applejack,I'm guessin' you've got a plan that'll keep it that way.
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,twilight sparkle,"The timing couldn't be more perfect. For one day only, right here in Ponyville, the Star Swirl the Bearded Traveling Museum! Cadance and I can spend the whole day looking at Star Swirl the Bearded artifacts!"
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,rarity,Sounds like a perfect drama-free way to spend the day with Cadance.
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,twilight sparkle,Not counting the drama surrounding which of the bells from his cloak they've chosen to put on display. Spoiler alert: it's this one!
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,rainbow dash,"[hacks] Uh, sorry. Something in my throat... like a big ball of 'lame'!"
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,rarity,I think it sounds delightful.
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,applejack,"Yup, definitely sounds like you two will have some real quality time together."
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,twilight sparkle,Exactly. Just quiet time.
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,princess cadance,Your Highness.
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,twilight sparkle,Your Highness.
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,princess cadance,"I'm teasing, Twilight. We're sisters-in-law. We don't have to be so formal."
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,princess cadance,"Knowing you, you've made some plans."
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,twilight sparkle,"Boy, have I. Hang on just one second. [to rest of main cast] You guys-"
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,rarity,"Now, now, don't you worry about a thing! We will make sure that nothing <U+0096> but nothing <U+0096> interferes with your visit."
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,applejack,"Go on, have a hootenanny with your kinfolk."
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,twilight sparkle,"You really are the best friends a pony could ever have. Coming, Cadance!"
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,pinkie pie,"[sighs] Two sisters-in-law bonding. Well, I for one am gonna make sure that nothing spoils their day!"
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,applejack,What is that thing?
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,rarity,Whatever it is... duuuck!!!
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,pinkie pie,"Rarity, that doesn't look anything like a duck!"
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,rainbow dash,What is that?
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,discord,"[sniffing] No, not a ""what"", but a ""who"", dear."
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,rainbow dash,"Oh, no... That sounds like..."
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,discord,[sneezes] [sniffs] Oh...
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,applejack,What in tarnation are you doin' here? And why the jumpin' June bugs are you blue?
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,rarity,"More like a shade of cerulean, to be precise."
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,rainbow dash,Whatever color you are is the color of trouble!
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,applejack,"What are you, sick or somethin'?"
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,discord,"Well, of course I'm sick. The blue skin? These sneezes? Could somebody find me a fainting couch?"
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,rarity,What?
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,rainbow dash,"If you're so 'sick', why have you come here instead of, y'know, staying home in bed and getting over your weird illness?"
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,discord,"[sneezes] [blows nose] Because this condition has left me helpless, simply helpless! Why, I can barely lift a spoon."
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,discord,"I came to find the one pony who truly understands me and could nurse me back to health. Where is that dear, sweet Fluttershy? I need attention! I need some care! I need-"
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,rainbow dash,You need to chill. Fluttershy's out.
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,discord,"Oh, of course, her trip to see the Breezies. Ah, yes, I had forgotten that was today."
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,applejack,How do you know about her trip?
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,discord,"Well, she told me about it in her last letter."
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,pinkie pie,You and Fluttershy write each other letters?
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,discord,"Well, of course we do! We're friends! It's just such a shame that today of all days is when I really need her. Oh, well, I know what to do."
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,rainbow dash,"Good thinking. Head on home, put your feet up. I'm sure eventually you'll have the strength to make yourself soup or something..."
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,discord,"Oh, no-no-no-no-no-no! I mean, while she's gone, you ponies can take care of me! Isn't that what friends are for, taking care of each other? [laughs] Let the healing begin!"
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,rainbow dash,Not it!
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,pinkie pie,"Don't you worry, Discord! I'll give you cuddles, and read you stories, and tell you all about me! I was born on a Tuesday-"
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,discord,"I so hope you don't mind, Pinkie Pie."
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,pinkie pie,"Well, as a matter of fact, I most certainly- Hey! Who keeps throwing away these perfectly good balloons?"
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,applejack,"[hushed] That joker's up to something, and whatever it is, we're gonna keep it as far away from Twilight and Princess Cadance as possible."
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,rarity,"[hushed] You're right. We promised we wouldn't let anything ruin their visit... although I do so wish that ""anything"" had turned out to be something else!"
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,discord,Did I hear you two talking about Princess Cadance's visit with Princess Twilight?
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,applejack,Maybe.
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,discord,"Fluttershy had mentioned that those two were getting together today. Mm-hm. How wonderful for them both. It is so rare that those two get to see one another. I don't know about you, but I sometimes wonder how close they could actually be. All those years apart before being reunited?"
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,applejack,They're plenty close.
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,discord,"And if they're not, this rare opportunity to focus on their friendship will certainly bring them closer. Unless..."
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,rarity,Don't even think about it! They mustn't be disturbed!
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,discord,Disturb them? I wouldn't dream of it. Not when I have two such dear friends of my own who have already offered to take care of me. And at such peril! This flu of mine is highly- [snorts] [sneezes] contagious.
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,twilight sparkle,A whole day to celebrate Star Swirl the Bearded. What could be better?
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,princess cadance,Absolutely nothing. [gasps] Is that the candlestick he used to light the way when he was exploring the caverns of Maretania?
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,twilight sparkle,It sure is!
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,princess cadance,"Oh, I can't believe I'm getting to see it in real life!"
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,twilight sparkle,Discord! What are you doing here?!
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,discord,"Oh, dear, dear Princesses, I'm sorry to say that I'm sick. [hacks] Blue flu."
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,princess cadance,Blue flu?
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,princess cadance,Magic health bubble.
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,twilight sparkle,Good thinking.
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,discord,"Indeed. How would Twilight nurse me back to health if she were sick too? You will be letting me stay at your place until I'm all better, won't you?"
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,twilight sparkle,"Stay? With me?! Uh, now is not really the best time, though I'm sure you already knew that..."
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,discord,"But taking in the sick and the desperate - isn't that what Fluttershy would do? Isn't 'helping' something that friends do for friends? Unless, of course, you're really saying that you're not my friend."
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,twilight sparkle,"[through gritted teeth] No, that is not what I'm saying."
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,discord,"Oh, how elated I am to hear that. Shall the three of us head back to your place? I don't want to get anypony else sick."
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,twilight sparkle,[sighs] Guess we don't have much choice.
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,discord,Carry me?
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,princess cadance,It isn't far. I think you can manage.
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,discord,"Oh, poo."
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,twilight sparkle,Need anything else?
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,discord,"Just knowing that I have a good friend like you to take care of me has made me feel better already. I'll be fine here on my own. Oh, just before you go, just a little small request."
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,princess cadance,It's going to be fine. We'll just get him what he wants and be back to the exhibit in no time. What was it that you needed?
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,discord,A little glass of water please A fresh pressed hanky if I sneeze Some tea with honey from the bees Whenever you can brew it
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,princess cadance,I'll get your tea.
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,discord,And while I get a little rest A teeny tiny small request Some codfish oil for my chest Poured from a crystal cruet
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,twilight sparkle,A crystal cruet?
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,discord,"[singing faster] My goodness, I'm a nincompoop Because I fear I've got the croup I need a vat of pumpkin soup And scarves made out of zinnias"
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,twilight sparkle,Anything else?
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,discord,I'll be grateful for your charity Until the bitter end Because I've heard that tenderness Is what you lend an ailing friend
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,twilight sparkle,"Right, but<U+0097>"
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,discord,"So, who's ready for my big reprise?"
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,twilight sparkle,"Alright, this is ridiculous!"
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,princess cadance,How did you even catch this flu?
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,discord,Inadequate hoof and claw washing?
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,twilight sparkle,There must be some way to just cure you! There has to be a spell or remedy in one of my books!
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,discord,There is one way...
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,princess cadance,And you didn't think to mention it earlier?
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,discord,"Slipped my mind. On a hill at the very edge of Equestria, there grows an exquisite magic flower. Pick the flower as it drops its petals at sunset. Then you can make a magical soothing elixir to cure the blue flu."
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,twilight sparkle,I suppose you have a good reason you didn't bother to get this flower as soon as you realized you were sick?
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,discord,"Well, I couldn't travel that far in my condition. By the time I got there, I'd be too weak to even attempt to retrieve the flower."
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,twilight sparkle,So where exactly are Cadance and I headed?
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,discord,"Well, [clears throat] you'll want to head north, turn left, th<U+0097> Oh... You know, it'd be much easier if I took you there myself."
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,princess cadance,I thought you were in no condition to travel.
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,twilight sparkle,Doing okay there?
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,princess cadance,"To be honest, I'm a little out of practice when it comes to flying."
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,discord,"Well, then lucky for you. We're here."
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,discord,It's just at the top of that hill.
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,twilight sparkle,I'm really sorry about this. All I wanted was to have some peaceful quality time together.
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,princess cadance,"I know, I was looking forward to it too."
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,twilight sparkle,"This is the top. But where is that flower? Oh. Come on, if we hurry, we can still have some time together."
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,princess cadance,One... last... pull!
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,twilight sparkle,"Phew! Let's get Discord and this flower back home, then all our problems are solved-"
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,princess cadance,What in Equestria?!
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,princess cadance,Twilight! Help!
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,twilight sparkle,Get your coils off my sister-in-law!
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,princess cadance,Let go of my sister-in-law!
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,twilight sparkle,Thanks!
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,princess cadance,Don't thank me yet!
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,twilight sparkle,Just... a little... more!
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,princess cadance,And for good measure...!
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,twilight sparkle,[panting] Are you okay?
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,princess cadance,[panting] Yes. Better than okay actually.
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,twilight sparkle,"Then let's get Discord back to Ponyville, make that elixir, and finally get a chance to spend some quality time together."
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,twilight sparkle,You... were... faking?!
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,discord,I was! But I had a very good reason.
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,twilight sparkle,We're listening.
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,discord,"Well, I was in my thinking tree <U+0096> that's where I do most of my really deep thinking <U+0096> I was there, and I said to myself, I said, ""Discord, your friend Twilight says that she's your pal, but she never writes and she never pops in for a visit."""
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,twilight sparkle,I don't even know where you li-
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,discord,"""Now that she's a princess, maybe she's decided that she's too good for you."""
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,twilight sparkle,I have never considered myself t-
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,discord,But how was I supposed to know for sure that I'm truly still friends with one of the most important ponies around?
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,twilight sparkle,I'm not more-
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,discord,"By seeing if you would go to the ends of Equestria for me, of course. Which you did, literally. Congratulations, Twilight, you passed my friendship test!"
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,discord,"Why the angry eyes? You love passing tests. It's not because my little exam put a damper on your visit with Princess Cadance, is it? Made it so that there was no time for you two to focus on your friendship?"
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,princess cadance,You didn't put a damper on our visit at all.
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,princess cadance,"Spending the day at the Star Swirl the Bearded exhibit would've been more relaxing, but to be honest, relaxation is the last thing I need."
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,twilight sparkle,It is?
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,princess cadance,"Don't get me wrong. Life in the Crystal Empire is wonderful, but it's become a little... predictable. I enjoy a little excitement now and then. Getting to face all these challenges today was just what I needed. And facing them with you just made me realize even more how lucky I am to have somepony like you as a friend. We may not see each other very often, but I know you'll always be there when I need you. Just like she was there for you, Discord."
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,discord,"Yes, she's a real sweetheart. We're all so lucky to have her in our lives."
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,discord,What in the world?!
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,twilight sparkle,"I think it's pretty clear that my visit with Cadance didn't go quite the way I expected. But in the end, I realized that when you're with a good friend, even the most chaotic day can end up being a great experience that brings you closer. Wouldn't you agree, Discord?"
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,discord,"[snorts] Yes, Twilight."
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,applejack,I don't wanna go sayin' you got what you deserved...
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,rarity,"Well, I have no trouble saying it. You got what you deserved!"
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,fluttershy,"Now, now, he's learned his lesson. Isn't that right, my little patient?"
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,discord,"I'm so glad that you're back from your trip, Fluttershy. Just your presence here is making me feel so much better. I was just wondering, could I trouble you for just one more thing?"
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,twilight sparkle,No!
Three's A Crowd,Meghan McCarthy & Ed Valentine,discord,"What? I was simply going to ask for a teeny, tiny glass of water."
Pinkie Pride,Amy Keating Rogers; story by Jayson Thiessen,cheese sandwich,"Well, Boneless. Looks like our work here is done."
Pinkie Pride,Amy Keating Rogers; story by Jayson Thiessen,cheese sandwich,"Yep, those ponies never partied so hard. Thanks to me: Cheese. Cheese Sandwich."
Pinkie Pride,Amy Keating Rogers; story by Jayson Thiessen,cheese sandwich,"Woo-hoo-hoo! That was a doozy! Well, Boneless. Looks like our next party is gonna be in... Ponyville."
Pinkie Pride,Amy Keating Rogers; story by Jayson Thiessen,pinkie pie,"Every single day there's something new you can plan for Every single day there's something wonderful to do But nothing makes me happy like a day that I can say ""Today I planned a party, and it's just for you!"""
Pinkie Pride,Amy Keating Rogers; story by Jayson Thiessen,pinkie pie,"Great, thanks! Got any streamers today?"
Pinkie Pride,Amy Keating Rogers; story by Jayson Thiessen,pinkie pie,Don't you know it!
Pinkie Pride,Amy Keating Rogers; story by Jayson Thiessen,pinkie pie,Don't have much time to gather all the things I need If I'm really gonna make this party fly For today's another day that all of Ponyville will say
Pinkie Pride,Amy Keating Rogers; story by Jayson Thiessen,diamond tiara,"She planned my cute-cea<f1>era my dad made me, I won't lie I demanded all the best, I suppose she passed the test Sure it was pretty good all thanks to Pinkie Pie"
Pinkie Pride,Amy Keating Rogers; story by Jayson Thiessen,pinkie pie,"Thanks, I guess?"
Pinkie Pride,Amy Keating Rogers; story by Jayson Thiessen,pinkie pie,I'm gonna need the full rainbow!
Pinkie Pride,Amy Keating Rogers; story by Jayson Thiessen,pinkie pie,"Yes, if you please!"
Pinkie Pride,Amy Keating Rogers; story by Jayson Thiessen,pinkie pie,Your biggest banner! This party's gonna be the best!
Pinkie Pride,Amy Keating Rogers; story by Jayson Thiessen,rarity,I don't know how she does it.

Pinkie Pride,Amy Keating Rogers; story by Jayson Thiessen,applejack,"Oh, boy! This is gonna be good!"

Pinkie Pride,Amy Keating Rogers; story by Jayson Thiessen,rainbow dash,Yeah!
Pinkie Pride,Amy Keating Rogers; story by Jayson Thiessen,pinkie pie,Rainbow Dash.
Pinkie Pride,Amy Keating Rogers; story by Jayson Thiessen,rainbow dash,"Yes, Pinkie?"
Pinkie Pride,Amy Keating Rogers; story by Jayson Thiessen,pinkie pie,"You realize that, by enlisting me as your party planner, I guarantee that this is going to be the funnest, most fantabulous, superbial party in Ponyville?"
Pinkie Pride,Amy Keating Rogers; story by Jayson Thiessen,rainbow dash,Uh...yeah? I guess.
Pinkie Pride,Amy Keating Rogers; story by Jayson Thiessen,pinkie pie,No guesses! Parties are no picnic.
Pinkie Pride,Amy Keating Rogers; story by Jayson Thiessen,fluttershy,"Oh, I like a nice picnic party."
Pinkie Pride,Amy Keating Rogers; story by Jayson Thiessen,fluttershy,Oh!
Pinkie Pride,Amy Keating Rogers; story by Jayson Thiessen,pinkie pie,Parties. Are. Serious! And you have my certified Pinkie Party Promise that you will have the best birthday party ever!

Pinkie Pride,Amy Keating Rogers; story by Jayson Thiessen,pinkie pie,"Great! Now, who's ready to join this super duper party pony to plan this super duper pa-rty?"
Pinkie Pride,Amy Keating Rogers; story by Jayson Thiessen,cheese sandwich,I am.
Pinkie Pride,Amy Keating Rogers; story by Jayson Thiessen,pinkie pie,"Who are you, stranger?"
Pinkie Pride,Amy Keating Rogers; story by Jayson Thiessen,cheese sandwich,Name's Cheese Sandwich. I plan parties.
Pinkie Pride,Amy Keating Rogers; story by Jayson Thiessen,pinkie pie,"What an amazing coincidence! I'm Pinkie Pie, and I'm planning a party!"
Pinkie Pride,Amy Keating Rogers; story by Jayson Thiessen,cheese sandwich,"Oh, it's no coincidence, my little pony. My cheesy sense was a-tingling, telling me a party was in the works."
Pinkie Pride,Amy Keating Rogers; story by Jayson Thiessen,pinkie pie,A cheesy sense? Ah! Double amazing! I have a Pinkie Sense!
Pinkie Pride,Amy Keating Rogers; story by Jayson Thiessen,cheese sandwich,"Yes. I sensed you did. And I happen to be the premiere party planner in all of Equestria. If there's a party in need, there I'll be. Be it wingding, hoedown, hootenanny, or shindig, I'm your pony."
Pinkie Pride,Amy Keating Rogers; story by Jayson Thiessen,pinkie pie,A pair of party pony planners in Ponyville?! What can be more perfect?!
Pinkie Pride,Amy Keating Rogers; story by Jayson Thiessen,rainbow dash,I'll tell you what -- making this party epic! 'Cause this isn't just any birthday. It's also the anniversary of when I moved to Ponyville!
Pinkie Pride,Amy Keating Rogers; story by Jayson Thiessen,rarity,"Good heavens, Rainbow Dash. It's your ""birth-iversary""!"
Pinkie Pride,Amy Keating Rogers; story by Jayson Thiessen,rainbow dash,"Exactly! So what do you say, party planners?"
Pinkie Pride,Amy Keating Rogers; story by Jayson Thiessen,pinkie pie,"Oh, I think we can do it!"
Pinkie Pride,Amy Keating Rogers; story by Jayson Thiessen,cheese sandwich,"Oh, I don't think so."
Pinkie Pride,Amy Keating Rogers; story by Jayson Thiessen,cheese sandwich,I know so! After all...
Pinkie Pride,Amy Keating Rogers; story by Jayson Thiessen,cheese sandwich,The super-duper party pony<U+0096>that pony is me I always knew that was the kind of pony I would be
Pinkie Pride,Amy Keating Rogers; story by Jayson Thiessen,pinkie pie,Me too!
Pinkie Pride,Amy Keating Rogers; story by Jayson Thiessen,cheese sandwich,"Come on, ponies! Who here likes to party? Ha-ha! You do! I can tell!"
Pinkie Pride,Amy Keating Rogers; story by Jayson Thiessen,pinkie pie,Like me!
Pinkie Pride,Amy Keating Rogers; story by Jayson Thiessen,cheese sandwich,"But everypony told me, ""Cheese, that fun just wastes the day"""
Pinkie Pride,Amy Keating Rogers; story by Jayson Thiessen,pinkie pie,As if!
Pinkie Pride,Amy Keating Rogers; story by Jayson Thiessen,cheese sandwich,But when I threw a party and I busted out some moves
Pinkie Pride,Amy Keating Rogers; story by Jayson Thiessen,pinkie pie,Uh-huh!
Pinkie Pride,Amy Keating Rogers; story by Jayson Thiessen,cheese sandwich,The ponies finally saw the light and got into the groove
Pinkie Pride,Amy Keating Rogers; story by Jayson Thiessen,pinkie pie,You know it!
Pinkie Pride,Amy Keating Rogers; story by Jayson Thiessen,cheese sandwich,The super-duper party pony<U+0096>that pony is me

Pinkie Pride,Amy Keating Rogers; story by Jayson Thiessen,cheese sandwich,You'll never meet another party pony quite like Cheese!

Pinkie Pride,Amy Keating Rogers; story by Jayson Thiessen,cheese sandwich,"Hey, good-lookin', want some mayonnaise?"
Pinkie Pride,Amy Keating Rogers; story by Jayson Thiessen,cheese sandwich,The super-duper party pony<U+0096>that pony is me You'll never meet another party pony quite like Cheese
Pinkie Pride,Amy Keating Rogers; story by Jayson Thiessen,cheese sandwich,"Oh, when I throw a Cheese party, be sure to not be lame And miss my pie fights, wacky kites, and streamers in your mane Fizzy drinks, Hawaiian shirts, and brie fondue delight You know that with Cheese Sandwich, you'll be partying all night!"
Pinkie Pride,Amy Keating Rogers; story by Jayson Thiessen,rainbow dash,"C'mon, everypony! Let's party down with Cheese!"
Pinkie Pride,Amy Keating Rogers; story by Jayson Thiessen,fluttershy,You're really a certified party pony?
Pinkie Pride,Amy Keating Rogers; story by Jayson Thiessen,cheese sandwich,That's right! That's my guarantee!
Pinkie Pride,Amy Keating Rogers; story by Jayson Thiessen,pinkie pie,But what about the super party pony named Pinkie...?
Pinkie Pride,Amy Keating Rogers; story by Jayson Thiessen,cheese sandwich,"[indistinct] Thanks buddy! You're gonna love this party! Hey kid, have a streamer, on me!"

Pinkie Pride,Amy Keating Rogers; story by Jayson Thiessen,cheese sandwich,Feels gouda!
Pinkie Pride,Amy Keating Rogers; story by Jayson Thiessen,rainbow dash,"Uh, heh, no offense, Pinkie."
Pinkie Pride,Amy Keating Rogers; story by Jayson Thiessen,rainbow dash,"My birth-iversary's already looking way cooler! You are my kind of party pony, Cheese Sandwich."
Pinkie Pride,Amy Keating Rogers; story by Jayson Thiessen,cheese sandwich,"[chuckles] You got that right, Rainbow Dash. All right, party ponies, I've got some planning to do!"
Pinkie Pride,Amy Keating Rogers; story by Jayson Thiessen,twilight sparkle,Pinkie! Aren't you gonna help Cheese Sandwich plan the party?
Pinkie Pride,Amy Keating Rogers; story by Jayson Thiessen,pinkie pie,That's okay. [chuckles nervously] He obviously has what it takes to do it all by himself. Heh.
Pinkie Pride,Amy Keating Rogers; story by Jayson Thiessen,twilight sparkle,Really?
Pinkie Pride,Amy Keating Rogers; story by Jayson Thiessen,pinkie pie,"Yes, indeedy! [chuckles nervously] After all, if Cheese really is the super duperiest partying-est pony of them all, maybe that means... I'm... not."
Pinkie Pride,Amy Keating Rogers; story by Jayson Thiessen,pinkie pie,"For all my life, all I've wanted to do Was make my friends want to smile true But maybe I was wrong And Pinkie Pie shouldn't plan parties at all"
Pinkie Pride,Amy Keating Rogers; story by Jayson Thiessen,applejack,"Well, they don't call him the super duper party planner for nothin'."
Pinkie Pride,Amy Keating Rogers; story by Jayson Thiessen,pinkie pie,That's it! This pony has gotta get her title back! And I know just what to do!
Pinkie Pride,Amy Keating Rogers; story by Jayson Thiessen,rainbow dash,Totally awesome!
Pinkie Pride,Amy Keating Rogers; story by Jayson Thiessen,applejack,Huh. Best I've ever seen.
Pinkie Pride,Amy Keating Rogers; story by Jayson Thiessen,twilight sparkle,I can't believe it!
Pinkie Pride,Amy Keating Rogers; story by Jayson Thiessen,pinkie pie,"Freeze, Cheese! I challenge you... to a goof off!"
Pinkie Pride,Amy Keating Rogers; story by Jayson Thiessen,fluttershy,"Oh, no! Not a goof off!"
Pinkie Pride,Amy Keating Rogers; story by Jayson Thiessen,applejack,[whispering] What's a goof off?
Pinkie Pride,Amy Keating Rogers; story by Jayson Thiessen,fluttershy,"I have no idea, hehe."
Pinkie Pride,Amy Keating Rogers; story by Jayson Thiessen,cheese sandwich,"This Cheese has stood alone a long time, Pinkie Pie. You think you can out-goof me?"
Pinkie Pride,Amy Keating Rogers; story by Jayson Thiessen,pinkie pie,"Oh, I don't think so. I know so! And the stakes are high, Cheese Sandwich. Whoever wins will be dubbed the ultimate super duper party pony and headline the Rainbow Dash birth-iversary bash!"
Pinkie Pride,Amy Keating Rogers; story by Jayson Thiessen,twilight sparkle,And the loser?
Pinkie Pride,Amy Keating Rogers; story by Jayson Thiessen,pinkie pie,Doesn't!
Pinkie Pride,Amy Keating Rogers; story by Jayson Thiessen,pinkie pie,"So, are you in, Cheese? Or are you... boneless?"
Pinkie Pride,Amy Keating Rogers; story by Jayson Thiessen,cheese sandwich,"Nopony calls me boneless. Right, Boneless?"
Pinkie Pride,Amy Keating Rogers; story by Jayson Thiessen,pinkie pie,Then the goof off is on for high noon!
Pinkie Pride,Amy Keating Rogers; story by Jayson Thiessen,twilight sparkle,"Um, Pinkie? It's already 3 o'clock."
Pinkie Pride,Amy Keating Rogers; story by Jayson Thiessen,pinkie pie,"Oh. Oh, well then. Make it 3:10 to goof off!"
Pinkie Pride,Amy Keating Rogers; story by Jayson Thiessen,twilight sparkle,"All right, everypony. According to my official goof off rulebook..."
Pinkie Pride,Amy Keating Rogers; story by Jayson Thiessen,rainbow dash,She actually has a goof off rulebook?
Pinkie Pride,Amy Keating Rogers; story by Jayson Thiessen,spike,Are you kidding? Twilight can find a rulebook for everything!
Pinkie Pride,Amy Keating Rogers; story by Jayson Thiessen,matilda,Shhh.
Pinkie Pride,Amy Keating Rogers; story by Jayson Thiessen,twilight sparkle,"The two competitors have free range to goof about -- be it by singing, dancing, playing, prancing, joking, or performing -- to make the judge chortle, chuckle, giggle, guffaw, hoot and holler, whoop it up, and party down."
Pinkie Pride,Amy Keating Rogers; story by Jayson Thiessen,twilight sparkle,"The funnier, sillier, wilder, and goofier, the better. Rainbow Dash, since the winner will be headlining your party, you are the judge."
Pinkie Pride,Amy Keating Rogers; story by Jayson Thiessen,rainbow dash,Heh. Big tense competition on my birth-iversary. What could be better?
Pinkie Pride,Amy Keating Rogers; story by Jayson Thiessen,twilight sparkle,"Cheese Sandwich, Pinkie Pie, are you ready?"
Pinkie Pride,Amy Keating Rogers; story by Jayson Thiessen,pinkie pie,I was born ready!
Pinkie Pride,Amy Keating Rogers; story by Jayson Thiessen,cheese sandwich,I was ready before I was born!
Pinkie Pride,Amy Keating Rogers; story by Jayson Thiessen,twilight sparkle,Then... Let the goofing begin!
Pinkie Pride,Amy Keating Rogers; story by Jayson Thiessen,pinkie pie,"It's your birthday party, a very special day I've got a song, it won't take long, I just wanted to say Happy, happy, happy, happy Happy, happy, happy, happy Happy, happy, happy, happy birthday to you!"
Pinkie Pride,Amy Keating Rogers; story by Jayson Thiessen,cheese sandwich,"If you wanna be the life of the party But you're feeling just a little uptight Call the doctor, beg and plead ""Doctor, tell me what I need"" Try to put a little cheese in your knees!"
Pinkie Pride,Amy Keating Rogers; story by Jayson Thiessen,pinkie pie,"Bubbles and balloons, bubbles and balloons What's a birthday party without bubbles and balloons? Star-shaped or trapezoid, look what I can do Only Pinkie Pie can make a bubble shaped like you!"
Pinkie Pride,Amy Keating Rogers; story by Jayson Thiessen,cheese sandwich,"Just let yourself go floppy, for now this is your chance Pretend you have no bones and do the rubber chicken dance!"
Pinkie Pride,Amy Keating Rogers; story by Jayson Thiessen,pinkie pie,"Cooler than a rubber chicken and tastier than cake Come on, you, let's party down and do the Gummy shake!"
Pinkie Pride,Amy Keating Rogers; story by Jayson Thiessen,cheese sandwich,"'Cause I like to make you smile, smile, smile Yes I do It fills my heart with sunshine all the while Yes it does 'Cause all I really need's a smile, smile, smile From these happy friends of mine"
Pinkie Pride,Amy Keating Rogers; story by Jayson Thiessen,pinkie pie,That's my song!
Pinkie Pride,Amy Keating Rogers; story by Jayson Thiessen,cheese sandwich,What do you mean? I have no idea what you're talking about.
Pinkie Pride,Amy Keating Rogers; story by Jayson Thiessen,pinkie pie,THAT'S IT!
Pinkie Pride,Amy Keating Rogers; story by Jayson Thiessen,pinkie pie,Roll out the party cannon When you hear the party cannon song Ka-BOOM!
Pinkie Pride,Amy Keating Rogers; story by Jayson Thiessen,cheese sandwich,Why should you compromise? Try this one on for size 'Cause nothing quite says cheer like the ringing in your ear Of the cheese supreme cannonball surprise!
Pinkie Pride,Amy Keating Rogers; story by Jayson Thiessen,pinkie pie,"<U+00A1>Dale, dale, dale No pierdas el tino! Porque si lo pierdes <U+00A1>Pierdes el camino!"
Pinkie Pride,Amy Keating Rogers; story by Jayson Thiessen,pinkie pie,[gasps] Rainbow's not having the best party ever! I... I broke the Pinkie Party Promise! Stop! The goof off is off!
Pinkie Pride,Amy Keating Rogers; story by Jayson Thiessen,rainbow dash,But I haven't named a winner.
Pinkie Pride,Amy Keating Rogers; story by Jayson Thiessen,pinkie pie,You don't have to. I forfeit. Which means... Cheese Sandwich wins.
Pinkie Pride,Amy Keating Rogers; story by Jayson Thiessen,cheese sandwich,[laughs] [sighs] ...I do?
Pinkie Pride,Amy Keating Rogers; story by Jayson Thiessen,pinkie pie,Yes. You get to headline Rainbow Dash's party.
Pinkie Pride,Amy Keating Rogers; story by Jayson Thiessen,twilight sparkle,"But, what about you, Pinkie?"
Pinkie Pride,Amy Keating Rogers; story by Jayson Thiessen,pinkie pie,I... [sniffles] I don't.
Pinkie Pride,Amy Keating Rogers; story by Jayson Thiessen,rainbow dash,"Pinkie, wait! I'm sorry I got all swept away by Cheese Sandwich."
Pinkie Pride,Amy Keating Rogers; story by Jayson Thiessen,twilight sparkle,We all are.
Pinkie Pride,Amy Keating Rogers; story by Jayson Thiessen,spike,"[sighs] Sorry, Pinkie."
Pinkie Pride,Amy Keating Rogers; story by Jayson Thiessen,pinkie pie,"No. I'm sorry I let my pride get in the way of you having the best birth-iversary ever. Cheese Sandwich really is a super duper party planner, and he'll be a terrific headliner. I should've been a big enough pony to admit that and let you have your day."
Pinkie Pride,Amy Keating Rogers; story by Jayson Thiessen,rainbow dash,"But don't you get it? You're both super duper party ponies. Sure, Cheese Sandwich is a great guest party pony, but you're Ponyville's permanent party pony. Nopony could ever take your place, and we could never have a party without you."
Pinkie Pride,Amy Keating Rogers; story by Jayson Thiessen,cheese sandwich,"Rainbow Dash is right. I never meant to take your place in Ponyville. I just wanted to show you what a great party pony I am, Pinkie."
Pinkie Pride,Amy Keating Rogers; story by Jayson Thiessen,pinkie pie,Why me?
Pinkie Pride,Amy Keating Rogers; story by Jayson Thiessen,cheese sandwich,Well...
Pinkie Pride,Amy Keating Rogers; story by Jayson Thiessen,cheese sandwich,"I fear I told a little fib about my pony past I hope that when you hear the truth, you will not be aghast I wasn't quite the super party pony like I claimed The fact is that I was so shy, nopony knew my name"
Pinkie Pride,Amy Keating Rogers; story by Jayson Thiessen,pinkie pie,Me?
Pinkie Pride,Amy Keating Rogers; story by Jayson Thiessen,cheese sandwich,Yes!
Pinkie Pride,Amy Keating Rogers; story by Jayson Thiessen,pinkie pie,"Hah, really?!"
Pinkie Pride,Amy Keating Rogers; story by Jayson Thiessen,cheese sandwich,Really!
Pinkie Pride,Amy Keating Rogers; story by Jayson Thiessen,pinkie pie,So I was the pony that threw the awesomely spectacular party that inspired you to become an awesome spectacular party thrower?
Pinkie Pride,Amy Keating Rogers; story by Jayson Thiessen,cheese sandwich,Swear on Camembert!
Pinkie Pride,Amy Keating Rogers; story by Jayson Thiessen,rainbow dash,"Enough with the warm fuzzy stuff, you two. It's my birth-iversary, and you gotta throw me a bash!"
Pinkie Pride,Amy Keating Rogers; story by Jayson Thiessen,pinkie pie,Yeah!
Pinkie Pride,Amy Keating Rogers; story by Jayson Thiessen,cheese sandwich,Let's go!
Pinkie Pride,Amy Keating Rogers; story by Jayson Thiessen,cheese sandwich,"All right, everypony! We are here to celebrate the birthday..."
Pinkie Pride,Amy Keating Rogers; story by Jayson Thiessen,pinkie pie,...and anniversary...
Pinkie Pride,Amy Keating Rogers; story by Jayson Thiessen,rainbow dash,"Hey, everypony! Who's ready to get their party on?! Hit it!"
Pinkie Pride,Amy Keating Rogers; story by Jayson Thiessen,pinkie pie,"Get your hooves up, party's starting out right now Everypony, everypony get down Time to make a wish, better make it right now It's been a year and today is your birthday party"
Pinkie Pride,Amy Keating Rogers; story by Jayson Thiessen,rainbow dash,"Cheese Sandwich! Oh, I gotta tell ya, you and Pinkie have totally made this the best birthday/anniversary super combo ever! Hah, it's totally--"
Pinkie Pride,Amy Keating Rogers; story by Jayson Thiessen,cheese sandwich,Epic?
Pinkie Pride,Amy Keating Rogers; story by Jayson Thiessen,rainbow dash,"Yeah, it is!"
Pinkie Pride,Amy Keating Rogers; story by Jayson Thiessen,cheese sandwich,"That's all I needed to hear, little filly. Just a little memento of my visit."
Pinkie Pride,Amy Keating Rogers; story by Jayson Thiessen,pinkie pie,You're giving me your special rubber chicken friend?
Pinkie Pride,Amy Keating Rogers; story by Jayson Thiessen,cheese sandwich,"Oh, he's not the only one. Well, Boneless Two, another job well done. But it's time we mosey along. Another town, another party."
Pinkie Pride,Amy Keating Rogers; story by Jayson Thiessen,pinkie pie,I never did get that pony's name.
Pinkie Pride,Amy Keating Rogers; story by Jayson Thiessen,pinkie pie,"[giggles] Oh, yeah!"
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,rainbow dash,Wow! I can't believe how many ponies showed up!
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,pinkie pie,"I can! I mean, finding out who the Ponyville Days pony of ceremonies is is a pretty big deal!"
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,I didn't know Granny Smith was on the selection committee.
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,applejack,"Of course she is. Ponyville Days celebrates the founding of Ponyville, and she was right there."
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,pinkie pie,I'm glad the committee didn't automatically pick me so everypony gets a chance to see how great being me actually is! Even though the festival's basically a party and the pony of ceremonies gets to organize the whole thing! So it'd totally make sense if they did pick me.
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,mayor mare,"Citizens of Ponyville, this year's applicants were all exceptional, but there can only be one Ponyville Days pony of ceremonies. And that pony is..."
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,mayor mare,Rarity!
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,applejack,"Whoo-ee! All right, Rarity!"
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"Congratulations, Rarity! Do you know what you're gonna do?"
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,rarity,"Oh, I might have a few ideas."
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,pinkie pie,"I'm so excited for the festival, I can hardly stand up straight!"
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,Me too. I'm glad Rarity was picked. I know she'll add a touch of elegance to the whole thing!
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,applejack,Probably more than a touch!
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,spike,"[clears throat] [reading] This year's Ponyville Days festival, designed by Rarity, will feature various high-class events such as... a silent cider auction and tasting."
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,spike,A Ponyville gala in town square.
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,spike,"And, of course, a Ponyville fashion show."
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,spike,This year's Ponyville Days festival pony of ceremonies creates shimmering couture of her own design.
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,rarity,"And the theme is... ""Small Town Chic""!"
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"Wow, Rarity. You really have put a lot of effort into this."
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,applejack,I'll say.
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,fluttershy,"Oh, I think it's going to be magical."
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,rarity,[gasps] Do you really think so?
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,pinkie pie,Are you kidding? I can't wait!
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,rarity,"Oh, that's such a relief. But of course, I couldn't possibly do it all on my own. The festival is in three days!"
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,rainbow dash,Pinkie Pie and I can hang lights and decorations in the town square!
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,applejack,And I can get Sweet Apple Acres all ready for the cider tastin'.
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,rarity,"Oh, that's just perfect! And now, Twilight, if you and Fluttershy wouldn't mind helping with the fashion show..."
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,Of course!
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,fluttershy,I'd be honored.
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,rarity,I can focus on the thing I'm worried about most of all.
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,rarity,Creating a Ponyville Days festival fantastic enough to impress... Trenderhoof!
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,applejack,"Uh, who's Trenderhoof?"
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,Sounds like somepony has a little bit of a crush.
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,rarity,"Thank you ever so much for joining me, Twilight. I don't think I could have met Trenderhoof on my own!"
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"It's no problem, but you shouldn't be nervous about meeting him."
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,rarity,"Is that him? Is he here? Twilight, is he there?"
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,Uhh... I'm not sure.
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,rarity,"You don't suppose he's decided not to come? Twilight, I don't see him! What if he doesn't arrive? The whole festival will be a disaster! Twilight, where is he?!"
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,rarity,[clears throat] Sorry.
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"Rarity, you have to get a hold of yourself. I mean, you haven't even met him yet!"
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,What's wrong?
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,rarity,"Shh! [hushed, quickly] It's him, it's him, is it him? Is it him? It's him, he's here, he's here!"
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"Well, go up and talk to him!"
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,rarity,"And over here will be the climax of the festival, the Ponyville Days gala! Music, dancing! [laughs nervously] And of course a locally sourced menu of delicious treats."
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,rarity,"Exactly! I, I can't even describe how much your work has influenced me!"
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,rarity,"And finally, Sweet Apple Acres. Ponyville's core, heh-heh, so to speak, where our quaint little hamlet began."
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,rarity,"Oh, yes, uh, they, they really do grow apples here."
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,rarity,"Oh, I had planned to transform it into an elegant country inn for the festival... but now I see just how special it is au naturel."
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,rarity,Who? Applejack? Ahem! Why are you staring at her like that?
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,spike,Rarity? Rarity! Hello?
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,spike,I brought my cider-tasting cup. Are you ready to go try the samples?
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,rarity,[sobbing throughout] What's the point?!
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,spike,"Rarity, what's wrong?"
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,rarity,Nothing!
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,spike,Is it something I said?
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,rarity,He doesn't like me.
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,spike,What?
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,rarity,He doesn't like me.
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,spike,"Rarity, I can't hear what you're<U+0097>"
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,rarity,"He doesn't like me because he has a crush on Applejack, even though I've had a crush on him ever since the beginning of time, and it's not fair!"
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,spike,Trenderhoof doesn't like you? That's ridiculous!
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,rarity,"Oh, Spike, how could you ever know what it's like to be totally obsessed with a pony only to find out they're obsessed with somepony else?"
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,rarity,"I mean, what could Applejack possibly have that I don't?!"
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,spike,I 'unno.
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,rarity,Hmm...
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,applejack,"Uh, gee, thanks. Granny Smith always said, ""Pick an apple a day and keep trouble away."""
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,applejack,"Uh, on the farm or in all of Equestria? 'Cause<U+0097>"
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,applejack,Is that a fact?
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,applejack,"Well, I hope you can relate to Ponyville."
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,applejack,"Look, I'm glad you're interested in Ponyville 'n' all, but I'm kinda busy with my chores. And if I can't get 'em done, there won't be a Ponyville Days festival for you to write about."
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,rarity,"Well, that will never do!"
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,applejack,"Rarity, what are you wearin'?"
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,rarity,"What, this old thing?"
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,applejack,Aren't you too busy plannin' the festival to keep makin' new outfits for it?
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,rarity,"I am. But the thought of hauling apples inspired me, and I just couldn't stop myself!"
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,applejack,Really?
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,rarity,"If there's one thing I love, it's hauling apples!"
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,applejack,[under her breath] Maybe you two should try it sometime.
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,spike,"Rarity, why do you want to plow a field?"
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,rarity,"Is it me, or could this use a splash of color? And maybe a wash!"
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,spike,Don't we need to check on the gala decorations?
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,rarity,"Yes, yes, of course, but Trend obviously has a thing for farm life. If I can't convince him that I'm just as much of a farm hoof as Applejack, I'll never get him interested in the festival."
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,spike,The festival. Right.
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,rarity,"And I do appreciate your help ever so much. I couldn't do a thing without you, Spikey-poo."
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,spike,"Well, that's what friends are for!"
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,rarity,"Right, so. [whips reins] Come on! [grunts] Farm... thing! [sighs] Oh, how does Applejack do it?"
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,applejack,"Well, it would help if the harness was on right! What are you doin'?"
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,rarity,"I am simply lending a hoof with the chores, which I love doing ever so much."
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,applejack,"Well if you're still interested after the festival I can teach you all about it. But right now, I need to get the plowin' done, if you don't mind."
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,rarity,Not at all. Ugh! Oh!
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,spike,She makes it look so easy.
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,rarity,I really don't see what the fuss is all about.
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,applejack,"Now, Rarity, you be careful. If you don't get the buckin' just right, you could sprain a hoof."
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,rarity,"I am perfectly familiar with the apple-bucking process, thank you very much. But while you seem to rely on raw power, I believe a certain amount of style is required. It's really more of a dance, if you ask me. [happy 'hm'ing noises] Et voil<e0>!"
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,applejack,"Well, your way is definitely long on style."
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,rarity,Thank you.
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,applejack,"Now, if you'll all excuse me, I have some more chores to do. Inside!"
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,rarity,"Oh, why, Trend, you can ask me anything."
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,rarity,Why don't you go ask her yourself?! Hmph!
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,applejack,"Whew! Well, that was close."
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,rarity,"If you've come to apologize, there's really no need."
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,applejack,What are you talkin' about?
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,rarity,"Let's dispense with the charade, shall we?"
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,applejack,"Listen, I know you really want Trend to like you<U+0097>"
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,rarity,And he does! Despite somepony's best efforts!
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,applejack,I swear I don't know why he's payin' so much attention to me. And I don't know anypony who's that interested in farmin'. Not even me!
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,rarity,"Well, maybe it's time Trend met a real country pony."
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,applejack,Shouldn't you be workin' on the festival instead of comin' up with new ways to impress Trend?
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,rarity,"Oh, I'm sure you'd love that. Well, I have a new vision for the festival, [in country accent] and it's gonna be more country than the whole Apple family put together!"
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,fluttershy,"Um, isn't it a little late to be changing the theme?"
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"Applejack, what's going on?"
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,applejack,I'm too scared to guess.
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,rarity,"[country accent] Firstly, I just want to thank you all for comin', and second, I know y'all will all adore my new festival theme!"
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,rarity,"[country accent] ""Simple Ways""!"
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,rarity,[country accent throughout] Well? What's so funny?
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,applejack,"Rarity, that is the silliest getup I have ever seen!"
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,fluttershy,It is a little funny.
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,rarity,Fun-nay?
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"[laughing] Rarity, you aren't serious, are you?"
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,rarity,[normal voice] Well of course I'm serious<U+0096> [clears throat] [back in country accent] Why wouldn't I be?
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,applejack,Because you would never dress like that. You like fashion and high society and fancy things.
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,rarity,And I can like plowin' fields and haulin' apples just as much.
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,applejack,But you don't!
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,rarity,How do you know what I like?
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,applejack,Because I know you.
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,rarity,"Wail, maybe you don't know me as well as you thank."
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,applejack,"And I suppose it's just a coincidence that Trenderhoof seemed so interested in country life, too?"
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,rarity,I don't know what you're gittin' at!
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,applejack,"Well then, I guess I'll just have to show you!"
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,rarity,"Be my guest! Now, if you all will excuse me, I have a hootenanny of a festival to put on."
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,rarity,"[country accent throughout] Now, to be a model in the Simple Ways fashion show, you might think ""simple"" means ""less is more"". Well, that just ain't so. If you want to be real simple, more is more. Now, y'all go off and make yourselves look just like that. [to Spike] Who's our next model for the fashion show?"
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,spike,Um... Apple... Jewel?
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,rarity,Who the hay is that?
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,rarity,Is this some kind of joke?
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,applejack,"[upper-class accent throughout] Why, Rarity, whatever would make you think I was joking?"
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,rarity,[normal voice] Because you would never wear an ensemble like that. You like plowing fields and hauling apples<U+0097>
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,applejack,And I can like fashion just as much.
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,rarity,[back in country accent] But you don't!
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,applejack,"Well, maybe you do not know me as well as you think."
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,rarity,"Fine. But I got a whole festival to plan, so if you're goin' to start modelin', just get on with it!"
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,applejack,"Life is a festival, and you should celebrate it by looking just like me! Because I'm a trend-setting fashionista!"
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,applejack,"Oh, is that so?"
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,rarity,"Yes, indeedy-doodle!"
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,applejack,[gasp] Not me! My mane needs to be perfectly coiffed at all times.
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,rarity,"Well, my mane is full of dust and split ends."
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,applejack,"My hooves are so polished, you can see your reflection in them."
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,rarity,My hooves are cracked and dry from working in the fields!
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,applejack,I'm so fashion-forward.
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,rarity,I wear droopy drawers!
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,applejack,I smell like rosebuds.
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,rarity,I love being covered in mud!
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,rarity,"[normal voice] Goodness! Your couture! Ooh, it's bad. Will somepony bring me a towel to wipe this repulsive filth from my hooves?!"
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,applejack,[normal voice] There's the Rarity I know!
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,rarity,"Oh, Applejack, I'm sorry I said all those things. You're a true friend who probably knows me better than I know myself. I don't know what I was thinking wearing this ridiculous outfit."
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,applejack,I kinda know how you feel.
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,rarity,"Oh, but you were just trying to help me see how silly I was being. And you were right. [sighs] Besides, that gown looks just gorgeous on you. I wish I hadn't ruined it."
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,applejack,"Thanks! It's nice, ain't it?"
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,rarity,It's magnificent! Wherever did you get it?
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,applejack,"Oh, it's, uh, one of yours."
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,rarity,"I'll need three gallons of boiling water and one ounce of detergent, stat!"
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,applejack,"Well, that's real nice, but I sure hope you weren't thinkin' of Sweet Apple Acres."
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,applejack,"Uh, look, you're a fine pony, but, uh, well, I'm, uh..."
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,rarity,"I think what Applejack is trying to say is that there's something unappealing about a pony who'd change themselves so much just to impress somepony else. If somepony doesn't like you for who you are, it's their loss."
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,rarity,"Not at all. In fact, I think I know just how you feel."
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,applejack,"What do you think, Rarity? Is it too late to go back to ""Small Town Chic""?"
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,rarity,Not if I can help it!
Simple Ways,Josh Haber,rarity,"Organizing the Ponyville Day celebration was one of the hardest things I've ever done. But I learned an important lesson. Real friends will like you for who you are, and changing yourself to impress them is no way to make new ones. And when you're as fabulous as I am, it's practically a crime!"
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,fluttershy,"Oh, good morning, little friends. Your singing is oh-so pretty."
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,fluttershy,"Yes, it is a very beautiful day today. Certainly something worth singing about."
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,fluttershy,"Oh, thank you so much. [giggles] You're too kind."
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,Wow!
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,fluttershy,Oh... You... um... you didn't hear me... um...
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,Singing in the most beautiful voice ever?!?
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,"Uh, yeah, we did!"
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"Wow, I've never heard you sing a solo like that before!"
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,It was like a little slice of heaven.
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,With ice cream on top!
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,"Fluttershy, I cannot believe your spectacular voice isn't part of the Pony Tones quartet!"
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,fluttershy,"Um, well, I<U+0097>"
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,Especially since you're having us perform for your Ponyville Pet Center fundraiser tomorrow night!
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,fluttershy,"Well, you see, I<U+0097>"
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,This simply must be rectified. You must share that stunning voice at the event!
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"Yeah! It'll be so amazing! You'll be there on stage, basking in the hooflights! The center of attention! A shining star! Everypony staring at you, judging you, jealously noting how they could be way better than you! Why wasn't it them? Why wasn't it them? And then, when you choke, they'll turn on you, becoming a seething, angry mob, and you'll be horribly humiliated, never able to show your face in Ponyville again!"
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,Pinkie Pie!
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,Don't be ridiculous!
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"Aw, but I'm so good at it!"
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,"[sighs] Come, Fluttershy, you will join the group, making the Pony Tones quartet the Pony Tones quintet!"
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,fluttershy,No.
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,Pardon me?
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,fluttershy,"I love the Pony Tones, I'm one of their biggest fans, but I do not want to perform with them."
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"Why not, Fluttershy?"
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,fluttershy,"Well, you see... I... I have... um... I... I have..."
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,Spit it out!
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,fluttershy,I have... stage fright.
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,[gasps] Is it contagious?!
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"Stage fright isn't a disease, Pinkie. It just means that Fluttershy is scared to perform in front of everypony."
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,fluttershy,"I'm very thankful the Pony Tones are singing at the Pet Center fundraiser, and I'm really looking forward to the performance, but I'll be watching safely from the audience."
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,"[sighs] Well... I think it's a terrible waste of an exquisite talent, but I understand that you're not comfortable."
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,fluttershy,Thank you. Oh! Angel's right. We'd better get going. There's a lot of work to do before tomorrow's event.
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,big mcintosh,"Bum, bum, bum-ba-da, ba-da Bum, bum, bum-ba-da ah"
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,big mcintosh,Everypony's sayin' you should learn to express your voice But if talk doesn't seem like it's the answer
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,spike,"Woo-hoo, yeah! Rarity, you were awesome!"
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,"Uh, thank you, Spike, but this is an ensemble."
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,spike,"Eh, the rest of you were pretty good too."
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,fluttershy,"Oh, I thought you were all amazing, Pony Tones!"
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,"Now, Pony Tones, I want you all to rest your voices for the remainder of the day. We'll do a final run-through tomorrow before the big event, alright?"
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,big mcintosh,Eeyup.
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,fluttershy,"Oh, Rarity, the Pony Tones are really gonna make the Ponyville Pet Center fundraiser so special. Thank you so much for helping me help the animals."
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,"Oh, yes. It is wonderful when a plan comes together without any sort of drama, isn't it?"
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,fluttershy,"Good morning, Pony Tones!"
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,"Actually, we're the Pony Tones minus one tone. Big Mac is inconveniently late."
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,Big Mac? Can you please start the song?
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,big mcintosh,[croaking] Nope.
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,Big Mac! Did you lose your voice?
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,big mcintosh,[gulps] [croaking] Eeyup.
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,Whatever did you do to cause this?
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,big mcintosh,[croaking] Well...
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"[through microphone] Howdy, everypony, and welcome to the twelfth annual Ponyville turkey call!"
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,Who will take the title this year? Will it be somepony new? Or will the turkey call champion of six years defend his title to make it lucky number seven?
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,granny smith,We'll find out if you stop your gabbin' and get on with the gobblin'!
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"Alright, everypony! Let's talk turkey! Big Mac, you're up!"
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,A...a...a turkey call? You lost your voice doing a... a turkey call?!
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,Now we can't perform tonight!
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,fluttershy,"Wait, what? No! You have to perform! Otherwise, the fundraiser will be a disaster!"
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,"Well, we cannot perform tonight with only three voices."
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,fluttershy,Why not?
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,"It would take rearranging all the music, and we just don't have time. I'm sorry, Fluttershy, but I have no remedy for this situation."
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,fluttershy,[gasps] Of course! A remedy! Follow me!
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,zecora,Hmmm.
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,big mcintosh,[croaking] Ahhhh.
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,zecora,Hmmm.
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,big mcintosh,[croaking] Ahhh<U+0097>
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,zecora,"I can cure this pony that is hoarse, but it will take a longer course."
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,"Uh, come again?"
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,zecora,"Mm. I can mix a brew that can work just right, but it cannot heal him by tonight."
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,fluttershy,"Oh, no! Ah! Where are we ever going to find a deep voice to replace Big Mac's?"
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,"Pardon me, Zecora, but this is no laughing matter! We need a bass voice for the harmonies to work! Without it, the performance will be ruined!"
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,zecora,"Please, forgive my strange elation, but I was not laughing at your situation."
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,Then what?
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,zecora,"Remember when you pony folk stumbled into poison joke? Miss Fluttershy had an unusual change, deepening her vocal range."
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,fluttershy,"[from Bridle Gossip, deep male voice] I don't want to talk about it."
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,"Yes, yes! Your voice became really low, making it sound like..."
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,fluttershy,[gasps] Flutterguy!
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,zecora,"With these leaves I can mix a brew, creating the same effect on you."
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,"Zecora, that's fantastic!"
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,fluttershy,Yes! I'll do it! I'd do anything for the animals!
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,"Why, you'd even appear on stage!"
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,fluttershy,Oh. Except that. I just can't bring myself to sing on stage in front of everypony.
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,What if you sang not in front of everypony?
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,fluttershy,Huh?
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,"What if Big Mac was onstage, moving his lips while you're behind the curtains singing his part? It would be just like singing in your house! Nopony would know it was you!"
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,fluttershy,"Even still, I just don't think I could sing in front of..."
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,You must! For the animals!
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,fluttershy,Oh... Okay then... [gulps] Mix it up!
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,"[hushed] Now, do it just like we practiced!"
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,"Good evening, citizens of Ponyville! I want to thank you all for coming out tonight and generously supporting the Ponyville Pet Center! Thanks to your kindness, pets are finding loving homes, and we're sure to meet our fundraising goal!"
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,Where's Fluttershy?
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,Probably hidin'. You know how much that pony hates the spotlight.
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,"So, with no further ado, please welcome the Pony Tones!"
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,Pony Tones! That was truly amazing!
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"And you sounded better than ever, big brother!"
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"Fluttershy, you were on the wrong side of the curtain! You totally missed the show!"
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,"Uh, just like a true professional, Fluttershy was backstage making sure everything ran smoothly! [hushed, to Fluttershy] And it was perfect."
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,"Why, thank you!"
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,We'd love to! When is it? Next week? Next month?
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,"Oh, gracious, I'm terribly sorry, but that's much too last minute."
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,fluttershy,"[deep male voice] Oh, Rarity, we can't disappoint that sweet little filly."
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,[hushed] Are you sure you're up for it?
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,mayor mare,"Amazing, Pony Tones! And it would be even more amazing if you could perform at my ribbon-cutting ceremony tomorrow!"
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,"Oh, Mayor, we would love to, but... [clears throat] Would you excuse us for a second, Mayor?"
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,mayor mare,Certainly.
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,"[hushed] Don't worry, Fluttershy, you don't have to perform again."
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,fluttershy,[deep male voice] But we wouldn't want to disappoint the Mayor.
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,"Well, then... Mayor? The Pony Tones will happily perform at your ceremony!"
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,fluttershy,[deep male voice] We wouldn't want to disappoint the spa patrons.
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,fluttershy,[deep male voice] We wouldn't want to disappoint the schoolponies.
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,"Fluttershy, we must talk to you. Big Mac's voice is all better!"
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,big mcintosh,Eeyup.
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,Now you can bathe in the poison joke antidote and sound like your lovely self again.
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,fluttershy,[deep male voice] It's just... I didn't know that last performance was my last performance.
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,"Fluttershy, stop! Ohhh... [to Big McIntosh] Would it be okay if Fluttershy sang for you one last time?"
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,big mcintosh,Hmm. Eeyup.
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"Big Mac, you got some 'splainin' to do! [beat] Turkey call?"
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,big mcintosh,Eeyup.
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,Trash your voice?
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,big mcintosh,Eeyup.
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,Zecora remedy?
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,big mcintosh,Eeyup.
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,Not quick enough?
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,big mcintosh,Nnope.
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,Needed a deep voice?
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,big mcintosh,Eeyup.
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,Poison joke?
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,big mcintosh,Eeyup.
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,Flutterguy?
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,big mcintosh,Eeyup.
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,Better now?
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,big mcintosh,Eeyup.
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,And that shy filly was livin' her dream in the shadows because she couldn't bring herself to come into the spotlight?
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,big mcintosh,Eeyup.
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"Well, for corn's sake! Let's go!"
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,Fluttershy? You in here?
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,fluttershy,[normal voice] Yes... I'm here.
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"That was totally unbelievable! I mean, the curtain came up and there you were, singing in front of everypony! And you know, I don't think anypony was jealous, 'cause there certainly wasn't an angry mob! But it must have been horrible standing there on stage, all eyes glued directly on you! It's like you were living your own personal worst nightmare!"
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,fluttershy,[crying] It was.
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,What? Too much?
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,What Pinkie meant to say is that you were really great!
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,Wait! Didn't I say that?
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,Hardly!
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,Whoops. You were great!
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,You totally blew my mind!
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,Incredible!
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"Though, no offense... you kind of sounded like a dude."
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"Uh, a great-sounding dude!"
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,fluttershy,"Well, thank you all. I'm glad you enjoyed it. Because I'm never going to sing in front of anypony ever again."
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,Are you kidding me?!
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,Can we please stop running?
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,"I just don't understand why, Fluttershy. After all, you're the one that wanted the Pony Tones to sing for every silly thing that was requested of us."
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,fluttershy,"You mean, you knew I really wanted to perform?"
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,Of course I knew!
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,fluttershy,Oh...
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,"And, for all her babbling, Pinkie Pie was right about one thing."
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,Only one?!
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,"When that curtain fell, and everypony saw you singing, you lived your worst nightmare! Was it really that bad?"
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,fluttershy,Yes!
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"Well, what was so bad about it?"
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,The thunderous applause?
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,The praise for your fantastic singin'?
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,The screaming fans?!
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,fluttershy,There's music in the treetops And there's music in the vale And all around the music fills the sky There's music by the river And there's music in the grass And the music makes your heart soar in reply
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,fluttershy,You've got to look inside and find
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,fluttershy,The music deep inside you
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,fluttershy,"'Cause when you look inside, you'll see it"
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,fluttershy,"You're gonna find it, gonna find"
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,"You did it, Fluttershy!"
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,See? That wasn't so bad.
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,And you didn't look completely petrified by the fact that we're all staring at you at all!
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,How do you feel?
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,fluttershy,Surprisingly... okay!
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,"Fantastic, because the Pony Tones have been booked for the Apple Family Zap Apple Jam Extraordinaire!"
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,fluttershy,"Oh, no... I couldn't do that!"
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,How come?
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,fluttershy,"I'll get there someday. But for now... baby steps, everypony. Baby steps."
Filli Vanilli,Amy Keating Rogers,fluttershy,"Sometimes, being afraid can stop you from doing something that you love, but hiding behind these fears means you're only hiding from your true self. It's much better to face those fears so you can shine and be the best pony you can possibly be."
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"Uh, Sweetie Belle, maybe we should run through the steps another few times before you try it on your own."
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,Nope. Ready to give it a shot!
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,Okay then!
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,[straining] Can't... seem... to...! [straining] [neck clicks] Ugh! Think I threw my neck out...
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,scootaloo,"Aw, you're okay."
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,apple bloom,A little more magic practice and liftin' brooms'll be a cinch!
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,I doubt it. That thing weighs a ton.
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,Hmph. I'll never get my cutie mark for this...
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,Maybe not. But I'm happy to keep helping you learn just for the fun of it as long as you like.
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,spike,"Hey, who's gonna clean up this mess?"
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"Scootaloo, I already told you I won't show you how, but I'll help you find the instructions so you can figure it out yourself."
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,scootaloo,"Ugh, I hate research!"
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"To your left, third shelf from the bottom. You'll find it in no time."
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,apple bloom,"Thanks so much for helpin' us all learn these new skills, Twilight."
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,Always glad to pass on my love of learning for learning's sake.
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,apple bloom,Only I'm afraid I'll never get the hang of this potion-makin'.
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,Did you follow the magic plant-growing formula I gave you?
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,apple bloom,Well... uh... more or less.
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"Well, let's try it out on this apple seedling and see how we do."
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,apple bloom,Oh... I hope this works.
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,apple bloom,"Layin' it on a little thick there, aren't we, pal?"
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,diamond tiara,Yoo-hoo! Gather 'round! It's time!
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,diamond tiara,"As you all know, I had promised to put on an amazing, first-time-ever acrobatic display for you all today!"
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,diamond tiara,"I know, it's so exciting. But I'm tired."
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,diamond tiara,"But I did not wish to disappoint you all, so I brought my butler Randolph to do them for me."
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,silver spoon,"That was amazing, Diamond Tiara."
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,diamond tiara,I know. I don't know how I do it.
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,apple bloom,I can't believe she gets so much attention without even really doing anything!
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,scootaloo,"She's using somepony else to build herself up, and without even putting any effort to learn her own skills like we do!"
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,"Hey, come to think of it, if we get really good at the stuff Twilight's teaching us, we could be the big shots around here for a change! Hmm..."
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,scootaloo,Check this out!
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,apple bloom,And check this out!
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,Now check this out!
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,diamond tiara,"[yelping] Hey, put me down!"
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,diamond tiara,"Hey, can you hear me?"
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,Huh? Huh? What? What?
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,diamond tiara,I was asking if your sister Rarity will be taking you to Manehattan anytime soon.
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,silver spoon,"Because if she is, maybe you can meet up with us while we hang out with a bunch of famous celebrities."
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,scootaloo,Cool!
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,apple bloom,"Wow, that's... pretty nice of you guys."
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,"Actually, my sister hasn't offered to take me to Manehattan anytime soon."
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,diamond tiara,"Yeah, we figured."
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,"Oh, yeah?! Well, I don't have to go all the way to Manehattan to hang out with the famous and super-cool ponies! Me and my friends hang out with Princess Twilight all the time!"
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,diamond tiara,D-did you say Princess Twilight?! You hang out with her all the time? For real?
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,apple bloom,More like just once a week.
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,scootaloo,She helps us learn cool new stuff to do! That we actually do ourselves!
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,diamond tiara,You must bring me along next time you go!
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,silver spoon,Bring us along!
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,diamond tiara,"I mean, we used to see her around town all the time, and I thought, ""whatever""..."
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,silver spoon,Me too. I thought that.
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,diamond tiara,"But now she's a princess, which makes her totally awesome!"
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,silver spoon,"Plus, she has wings."
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,diamond tiara,And she's an Alicorn. So can I<U+0096>
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,silver spoon,We!
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,diamond tiara,<U+0096>go?
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,apple bloom,I don't think we should<U+0096>
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,Would you two excuse us for a moment? We should totally say yes! This is a golden opportunity!
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,apple bloom,Are you kiddin'? I don't want them laughing at us while I'm mixin' potions and accidentally sendin' plants into chokin' fits!
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,But don't you get it? They'll have to learn something too!
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,scootaloo,And they won't be able to laugh at us when they're so busy trying to learn stuff of their own.
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,apple bloom,I must admit it's kinda fun to see them workin' hard to get on our good side for a change.
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,diamond tiara,"Oh, my gosh! A princess lives in there! And I'm about to go inside and see her! I can't even tell you how excited I am!"
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,silver spoon,I can't either!
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,"Now remember, Twilight takes this time out with us so we can learn stuff."
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"Hey there, guys! Come on in!"
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,diamond tiara,"Oh, it's really her!"
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,silver spoon,"Oh, my gosh, I don't believe it!"
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"Oh, and, uh, you brought guests. Great!"
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,diamond tiara,"Princess Twilight, it is such a thrill and honor to be here! You have no idea. Oh my gosh, who dyes your tail?"
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,silver spoon,I so have to get that done.
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"Actually, it's not dyed. I've always<U+0096>"
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,diamond tiara,[gasp] Are those books in there? What a bold design choice!
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,silver spoon,"You should so do that, Di!"
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,diamond tiara,"I know, right?"
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"Listen, I'm all for helping as many ponies as I can, but maybe we should keep these weekly visits just between us, hm? Okay, which one of you wants to practice first?"
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,Shouldn't they go first?
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"No, silly! I set up Twilight Time especially for you. Apple Bloom, go ahead. Let's see how your plant potions are coming."
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,apple bloom,I can't believe I let you talk us into bringin' guests yesterday.
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,scootaloo,"I didn't hear them laugh at us once, Apple Bloom."
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,apple bloom,'Cause they laughed on the inside.
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,Don't worry. We won't make that same mistake again.
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,apple bloom,"Aw, great. Look who showed up to make fun of us."
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,scootaloo,So much for learning skills to be big shots.
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,diamond tiara,"Hey, guess what! I told everyone about your special Twilight Time!"
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,"Oh, no, here it comes..."
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,diamond tiara,And they all want in!
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,diamond tiara,"Thanks to me, you three are now the hottest thing around. You're welcome."
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,Uh-oh...
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,Wow! All these ponies really wanna meet Twilight that badly?
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,pipsqueak,"We love you, Cutie Mark Crusaders!"
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,diamond tiara,"Now, now, everypony! Demanding time with the princess as an unruly mob simply won't do. Might I suggest you get organized through us, the Cutie Mark Crusaders' nearest and dearest friends?"
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,silver spoon,"Everypony get in line! No pushing, no pushing!"
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,apple bloom,What a mess.
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,Of awesome! Don't you see? We're really and truly and certifiably the biggest of the big shots in school right now!
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,scootaloo,Huh?
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,"They all think we're the greatest, because we're their ticket to get time with Ponyville's newest and biggest celebrity, Princess Twilight!"
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,apple bloom,We just said like two seconds ago that invitin' two ponies to Twilight Time was a big mistake! And now we're supposed to bring the whole class?
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,Relax. I got this.
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,apple bloom,"I don't like this, Sweetie Belle..."
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,You said not to invite them to Twilight Time and I didn't. So what's the problem?
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,scootaloo,This feels like a trick.
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,What's tricky about inviting Twilight out for a meal thanking her for all the nice things she's done for us? Seems like the least we can do for the princess!
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,pipsqueak,"Did someone say ""princess""?"
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,"When I told you when you could come eyeball the princess at one of her favorite hangouts, I said only two or three of you, tops!"
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,scootaloo,She's coming!
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,Okay! But stay out of sight!
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,diamond tiara,"As you wish, Sweetie Belle."
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,"Yes, as I wish."
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"[messy eating noises] Mmm! Mmmm, mm! [with mouth full] I didn't realize how hungry I was! I'm so glad you asked me to join you here today... [swallows] I'm so honored! Mm!"
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,You are?
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"When you first asked me to help you develop new skills, I thought, 'Working with young students so devoted to the joy of learning purely for its own sake? What could be better?' You all remind me of myself when I was your age!"
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,"Yes, well... we feel the same way."
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,apple bloom,That's why we invited you here.
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,scootaloo,All because of our love of learning!
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,"Twilight! Haven't seen you here in, like, forever and a half!"
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,I know. I've been so busy I forgot how delicious everything is here!
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,"Totally! Hey, what's going on out there? Oh, never mind, they're gone. They're back! Never mind, they're gone. La la-la la-la..."
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,apple bloom,[through gritted teeth] Knock it off!
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,apple bloom,What was all this? And this?
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,scootaloo,"I couldn't help it! When I don't smile in a picture, I look sad."
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,"Oh, we're gonna look sad all right..."
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"[gasps] [long pause] Uh, can I... help you?"
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,diamond tiara,Get my picture with her!
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,pipsqueak,Me first!
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,silver spoon,Hey! Get out of the shot!
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,This is bad.
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,scootaloo,Twilight's gonna be so ticked at us.
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,apple bloom,I told ya this was a terrible idea.
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"You seriously all want my autograph? Okay, I'll sign just a couple more for you, but then I really must get back to my little friends. Oh, there you are!"
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,pipsqueak,"Wow, to think I've been to the Hay Burger so many times, never knowing it's a regular hangout for a princess!"
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,This isn't my regular hangout. I'm only here to be with them.
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,pipsqueak,"You mean, Princess Twilight decides where it's cool to go based on where they go?"
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,cutie mark crusaders,Huh?
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"Thanks, guys, this was fun! See ya around!"
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,pipsqueak,I'm opening a new lemonade stand! Won't you come to the grand opening? I'll give you free lemonade for a week!
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,Relax. I know exactly how to handle this.
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,pipsqueak,More lemonade?
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,Don't mind if I do!
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,scootaloo,"Whoa, so bright I can see myself!"
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,apple bloom,And so can I! Nice job bedazzlin' my bow! What do I owe you?
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,diamond tiara,You three must come to my pool party. It'll be much cooler than this.
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,Look who's inviting who to her fancy house!
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,apple bloom,"I believe we have arrived, Cutie Mark Crusaders."
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,cutie mark crusaders,Yeah!
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,"Wow, this is nice, but there's no one else here. Why is this party cooler, exactly?"
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,diamond tiara,Because of all the ponies we're keeping out.
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,"This has been great, but we have to go. It's Twilight Time."
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,diamond tiara,"So, we're coming too, right?"
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,"Um... a-actually, no. We didn't have a chance to ask Twilight, so<U+0096>"
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,diamond tiara,Really? After all the favors we did for you? After all the favors they did for you?
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,"Okay, I know exactly how to handle this. Run!"
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,"Go, go, go!"
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,scootaloo,We gotta beat them to Twilight's so we can explain!
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,This way! I know a shortcut!
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,apple bloom,"Then we run, like the wind!"
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,[gasps] [out of breath] We... made... it... Quick! Knock on<U+0096>
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,"Twilight, we can explain."
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,apple bloom,We know you said we should just keep Twilight Time to us!
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,scootaloo,We didn't mean for so many other ponies to be here! Honest!
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"Oh, don't be silly. I only meant that for your benefit so you could get the most out of our time together. But if you want to share your time with others, that's fine."
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,scootaloo,So you're not mad?
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"Of course not! Come on in, everypony! Spike made nachos!"
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,Turns out we'll need some more than that.
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"Before we start, we should maybe get a bit more organized? Ponies interested in magic in this corner. Ponies who want to learn potions over here. Bookworm ponies over there."
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,apple bloom,Incredible. Looks like everything's workin' out just fine.
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,scootaloo,And I was so afraid Twilight would be disappointed in us.
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,Told you I knew exactly how to handle all this!
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,Thanks to all of you for taking time out to come learn new things.
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,diamond tiara,"Thank you, princess!"
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,silver spoon,"We love you, princess!"
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"Okay, okay, let's settle down. If you want to thank anypony, thank the Cutie Mark Crusaders for so generously sharing this time."
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,"It was nothing, really. We just felt it was the right thing to do."
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,diamond tiara,Hmph! What a laugh.
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"Let's begin over here. And what would you like to learn, little one?"
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,pipsqueak,I want to learn how to become a Cutie Mark Crusader!
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"And why do you want to become a Cutie Mark Crusader so badly, hm?"
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,pipsqueak,Because then I could get all my classmates to do me favors and stuff because I'm friends with a famous princess!
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,"Oh, boy."
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,Is this true?
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,We wanted our time together just as a way to be with you and learn new things. Really and truly!
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,Prove it.
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,Huh?!
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"If it's true, then I'm sure you've all been practicing your skills over the past week. Show me how much better you got."
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,apple bloom,"Uh, well, uh... we... can't."
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,scootaloo,We kinda rushed over and forgot to bring our stuff.
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"Hm, I see."
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,"No, wait! Hey, everypony, you're in luck! You came to learn, but instead you're getting dinner and a show! Get ready, 'cause we, the Cutie Mark Crusaders, are about to lay on you the amazing skills we learned in Twilight Time!"
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,"Unfortunately, since we don't have Scootaloo's unicycle parts, she'll take apart and put back together one of the scooters from outside."
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,pipsqueak,Hey! That's my scooter!
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,scootaloo,"You got us into this mess, kid. Might wanna roll with us."
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,pipsqueak,Huh?
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,"Apple Bloom doesn't have her apple seed with her, so she'll just grab an apple from the kitchen. And I will begin by using my magic to lift this broom!"
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,scootaloo,Ta-da!
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,apple bloom,Become a tree!
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,Rise!
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,That didn't turn out quite how I had hoped.
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,Looks like Twilight Time is over.
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,diamond tiara,And look who's not the princess's entourage anymore.
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,silver spoon,Guess they didn't come here to learn after all.
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"Well, neither did any of you."
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,"We're really sorry, Twilight. We made a huge mistake."
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,apple bloom,And we really and truly did enjoy learning new skills with you.
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,scootaloo,"Guess we'll have to just keep on doing it without you now. Thanks, Twilight."
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,apple bloom,Thanks...
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,Thanks...
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,Sweetie Belle? Remember a moment ago when you asked me to give you a chance?
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,spike,"[straining] Aw, come on!"
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,"I guess Twilight must not be so super-upset anymore, 'cause she's letting us do a diary entry like our sisters do. Boy, did we get our priorities messed up. We started acting special because we were friends with someone special. We almost forgot the real reason she's special <U+0096> because she's our friend. But she forgave us, and, like magic, things are good as new! That's the kind of magic I really want to get good at, now that I'm getting so good at the other kind."
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"Wow, all three of you have made so much progress! I'm really proud of you. See you next time!"
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,We're just glad Twilight Time is back to normal. Well... almost back to normal. I just hope no one sees us.
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,apple bloom,'Cause we're tryin' to keep Twilight Time a secret now?
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,scootaloo,Or because we look ridiculous?
Twilight Time,Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,"A little of both, actually."
It Ain't Easy Being Breezies,Natasha Levinger,fluttershy,"Okay, everypony. As you know, the adorable fairy creatures known as Breezies are about to come through Ponyville."
It Ain't Easy Being Breezies,Natasha Levinger,pinkie pie,"Yes! Ooh, it's so exciting! Ah! I can't wait for Rainbow Dash to make the breeze for them so I can see how cute they are up close!"
It Ain't Easy Being Breezies,Natasha Levinger,rainbow dash,"I've never done it before, not that I won't be totally awesome at it, because I totally will!"
It Ain't Easy Being Breezies,Natasha Levinger,fluttershy,"And that breeze is very important, but so is cheering on those teeny-tiny little things, so they have the confidence to ride that breeze to their native land. Did I mention how tiny they are? So tiny! I was thinking we could do a special Breezie cheer!"
It Ain't Easy Being Breezies,Natasha Levinger,pinkie pie,I love cheers!
It Ain't Easy Being Breezies,Natasha Levinger,fluttershy,"But these cheers should be quiet cheers. We don't want to startle them. They need to be able to concentrate. Why don't we try it? You can do it, Breezies."
It Ain't Easy Being Breezies,Natasha Levinger,fluttershy,"Oh, my."
It Ain't Easy Being Breezies,Natasha Levinger,applejack,"Heh, sorry, Fluttershy. I had no idea how hard it was to do a cheer quietly."
It Ain't Easy Being Breezies,Natasha Levinger,fluttershy,"Oh, it's okay. Quiet doesn't come naturally for everypony. Let's try it again."
It Ain't Easy Being Breezies,Natasha Levinger,fluttershy,Perhaps just a little bit quieter.
It Ain't Easy Being Breezies,Natasha Levinger,fluttershy,Just a little quieter.
It Ain't Easy Being Breezies,Natasha Levinger,fluttershy,"[loudly] Perfect! Oh, um, I mean... yay."
It Ain't Easy Being Breezies,Natasha Levinger,rainbow dash,That's too strong! We gotta slow this breeze down or we're gonna blow those Breezies apart!
It Ain't Easy Being Breezies,Natasha Levinger,mr. cake,Mr. What I don't understand is why they need the Pegasi to make a breeze for them.
It Ain't Easy Being Breezies,Natasha Levinger,fluttershy,"Well, you see, it's the breeze that activates the Breezies' magic, and that magic protects the pollen they're carrying from being destroyed."
It Ain't Easy Being Breezies,Natasha Levinger,mr. cake,"Mr. So, no breeze means no magic means the pollen goes bad?"
It Ain't Easy Being Breezies,Natasha Levinger,fluttershy,That's right! And they only have two days to get that pollen back before the portal to their home closes. That's why it's ever-so-important that we help them make their way through Ponyville safely.
It Ain't Easy Being Breezies,Natasha Levinger,mrs. cake,Mrs. We certainly wouldn't want to scare them and divert them from their path!
It Ain't Easy Being Breezies,Natasha Levinger,fluttershy,Now you understand.
It Ain't Easy Being Breezies,Natasha Levinger,mr. cake,"Mr. Hm, you certainly know a lot about them."
It Ain't Easy Being Breezies,Natasha Levinger,fluttershy,"Oh, thank you. I went to see them gathering their pollen in Western Equestria. Um, Rarity? I, uh, hate to weigh in with you when it comes to fashion, but..."
It Ain't Easy Being Breezies,Natasha Levinger,rarity,"Oh, there's too much purple on this, isn't there? I knew it! But Twilight refused to admit it."
It Ain't Easy Being Breezies,Natasha Levinger,twilight sparkle,What?! I-
It Ain't Easy Being Breezies,Natasha Levinger,fluttershy,"Oh, no-no-no-no-no. It's the perfect amount of purple. It's just that there's an awful lot of sequins on your jacket."
It Ain't Easy Being Breezies,Natasha Levinger,fluttershy,"You can if they reflect the sun, and the light catches a group of Breezies right in their eyes, and blinds them long enough to get them off their course so they never get home!"
It Ain't Easy Being Breezies,Natasha Levinger,rarity,I stand corrected! I suppose there is the rare instance where one can have too many sequins. I'll just take off my jacket. I suppose this won't do either?
It Ain't Easy Being Breezies,Natasha Levinger,twilight sparkle,"[whispering] Everypony, it's time. Please welcome... the Breezies!"
It Ain't Easy Being Breezies,Natasha Levinger,applejack,They're as cute as Apple Bloom on the day she was born.
It Ain't Easy Being Breezies,Natasha Levinger,rarity,And would you look at those adorable little packs they carry their pollen in?
It Ain't Easy Being Breezies,Natasha Levinger,pinkie pie,So... cute! Can't... take... it!
It Ain't Easy Being Breezies,Natasha Levinger,spike,"[grunts] [hushed] Pinkie Pie, can I hop on you so I can see the Breezies?"
It Ain't Easy Being Breezies,Natasha Levinger,pinkie pie,"[hushed, straining] May explode!"
It Ain't Easy Being Breezies,Natasha Levinger,spike,"Oh, no!"
It Ain't Easy Being Breezies,Natasha Levinger,rainbow dash,Slow down the breeze for the other group to catch up!
It Ain't Easy Being Breezies,Natasha Levinger,rainbow dash,What if we speed it up?
It Ain't Easy Being Breezies,Natasha Levinger,fluttershy,He's right! You must all gather as close as you possibly can!
It Ain't Easy Being Breezies,Natasha Levinger,fluttershy,"Oh, I understand the language of all kinds of creatures!"
It Ain't Easy Being Breezies,Natasha Levinger,fluttershy,And you speak my language too?
It Ain't Easy Being Breezies,Natasha Levinger,pinkie pie,That was amazing!
It Ain't Easy Being Breezies,Natasha Levinger,rainbow dash,I'm sorry we couldn't get a breeze going that would get them back to the others.
It Ain't Easy Being Breezies,Natasha Levinger,fluttershy,"Oh, it's not your fault."
It Ain't Easy Being Breezies,Natasha Levinger,twilight sparkle,"I, for one, am very proud of you, Fluttershy. Leaping into action like that."
It Ain't Easy Being Breezies,Natasha Levinger,rarity,I feel like I should design you a special hero's gown! Heh... Or a sash. At least a sash.
It Ain't Easy Being Breezies,Natasha Levinger,spike,"Okay, okay, okay! I know what you're all thinking! Why don't you just say it?! [crying] I'm sorry! This is all my fault! I'm so, so sorry!"
It Ain't Easy Being Breezies,Natasha Levinger,fluttershy,"Oh, Spike, it's okay! It could have happened to any one of us."
It Ain't Easy Being Breezies,Natasha Levinger,spike,Okay... Thank you!
It Ain't Easy Being Breezies,Natasha Levinger,spike,Uh... I'm... just... gonna stay over here.
It Ain't Easy Being Breezies,Natasha Levinger,rainbow dash,"So, Fluttershy, you want us to get the breeze going again so these little guys can get a move on?"
It Ain't Easy Being Breezies,Natasha Levinger,fluttershy,Maybe we should wait just a moment or so. They've been through so much...
It Ain't Easy Being Breezies,Natasha Levinger,rainbow dash,Just gimme the word when you think they're ready.
It Ain't Easy Being Breezies,Natasha Levinger,fluttershy,"Oh, my, Twirly, you look like you need a blanket."
It Ain't Easy Being Breezies,Natasha Levinger,fluttershy,"Oh, no problem."
It Ain't Easy Being Breezies,Natasha Levinger,fluttershy,"Oh, did you need some more water?"
It Ain't Easy Being Breezies,Natasha Levinger,fluttershy,"Now, who else needed a hoof-knitted sweater?"
It Ain't Easy Being Breezies,Natasha Levinger,applejack,Hey there! Can we come in?
It Ain't Easy Being Breezies,Natasha Levinger,fluttershy,"Oh, of course! But watch your step!"
It Ain't Easy Being Breezies,Natasha Levinger,applejack,"Oop, sorry about that, little one."
It Ain't Easy Being Breezies,Natasha Levinger,twilight sparkle,We just wanted to see if you thought the Breezies were ready to give it another try.
It Ain't Easy Being Breezies,Natasha Levinger,fluttershy,"Has it been an hour already? Oh, my goodness! Time flies when you're making sure little creatures don't feel that you're abandoning them to the cruel world."
It Ain't Easy Being Breezies,Natasha Levinger,twilight sparkle,"But they're not going to a cruel world, right? They're going home."
It Ain't Easy Being Breezies,Natasha Levinger,fluttershy,"Oh, yes, that's right!"
It Ain't Easy Being Breezies,Natasha Levinger,fluttershy,"On second thought, I don't think they're quite ready."
It Ain't Easy Being Breezies,Natasha Levinger,applejack,Uh... what did he say?
It Ain't Easy Being Breezies,Natasha Levinger,fluttershy,I'd... rather not say.
It Ain't Easy Being Breezies,Natasha Levinger,applejack,"Okay, well, I'm sure you know what you're doin'. No one knows rare magical creatures like you do."
It Ain't Easy Being Breezies,Natasha Levinger,twilight sparkle,We'll just wait for your word.
It Ain't Easy Being Breezies,Natasha Levinger,fluttershy,Thank you. I'll be in touch very soon.
It Ain't Easy Being Breezies,Natasha Levinger,fluttershy,"Um, now, Seabreeze-"
It Ain't Easy Being Breezies,Natasha Levinger,fluttershy,"But that is just not true, Seabreeze. It was because of a leaf, and you know that!"
It Ain't Easy Being Breezies,Natasha Levinger,fluttershy,"Well, I didn't say that exactly now, did I?"
It Ain't Easy Being Breezies,Natasha Levinger,fluttershy,"Oh, well, maybe a snack will lighten the mood."
It Ain't Easy Being Breezies,Natasha Levinger,fluttershy,"You're excused. Well, my Breezies, I think we can all agree that now that you've eaten and you have a little energy going in your breezy bodies, you're strong enough to face the breeze! I've loved having you here, and I hope I've made you all feel loved and special. But you have to go. Nopony here will deny that-"
It Ain't Easy Being Breezies,Natasha Levinger,fluttershy,"Okay, well, a confusing pep-talk, but nonetheless. I do know that if you don't leave soon, you may never make it back, and that would be terrible!"
It Ain't Easy Being Breezies,Natasha Levinger,fluttershy,I had no idea you all have colds! Really? All of you?
It Ain't Easy Being Breezies,Natasha Levinger,fluttershy,"Oh, dear. I can't let you go out there sick! What kind of a friend would I be if I made you go now?"
It Ain't Easy Being Breezies,Natasha Levinger,rainbow dash,"Hey, Fluttershy, just wondering if the Breezies are ready to go yet. Clock's kinda ticking for them to make it back before the door closes on their home."
It Ain't Easy Being Breezies,Natasha Levinger,fluttershy,"Oh, yes. I mean, not quite. Um, maybe just a few more minutes?"
It Ain't Easy Being Breezies,Natasha Levinger,rainbow dash,"Uh, alright."
It Ain't Easy Being Breezies,Natasha Levinger,rainbow dash,We just have to trust Fluttershy. She must know what she's doing.
It Ain't Easy Being Breezies,Natasha Levinger,fluttershy,"Breezies, I must say, Seabreeze has a point. I think it's time for me to get Rainbow Dash and her friends so they can create the breeze for you to get home."
It Ain't Easy Being Breezies,Natasha Levinger,fluttershy,"Ooh... You're all awfully anxious... Oh, I don't want you to feel abandoned, or that I wasn't the most kind host I could possibly be..."
It Ain't Easy Being Breezies,Natasha Levinger,fluttershy,"Oh, yes, that does make sense... Seabreeze, do you think you could wait just a couple more hou- Seabreeze? Seabreeze? Has anypony seen Seabreeze? [gasps] Where's he going? There's no way he can handle being out there on his own!"
It Ain't Easy Being Breezies,Natasha Levinger,fluttershy,"Excuse me, bees? Can you please back off my Breezie friend? He didn't mean any harm. It was just an accident. I'm working on a bee-type dance and was hoping you could help me? Does this bring to mind any images for you? Perhaps a bee? Excuse me! I have done nothing but be kind, but I guess that is not working! You bees know better than to hurt a helpless Breezie! I demand that you go away now, or you'll have to answer to me!"
It Ain't Easy Being Breezies,Natasha Levinger,fluttershy,Of course. You could've gotten seriously hurt out there. Ponyville is much too dangerous for you. One tiny acorn is a threat!
It Ain't Easy Being Breezies,Natasha Levinger,fluttershy,"Oh, my goodness. I was just trying not to hurt any creature's feelings, but my displays of kindness may have cost you everything... [gasps] Time is running out, and you may never make it home!"
It Ain't Easy Being Breezies,Natasha Levinger,fluttershy,"Seabreeze, I understand your feelings are hurt, but it's hard for them to hear you when you're shouting and being mean. The message doesn't get across."
It Ain't Easy Being Breezies,Natasha Levinger,fluttershy,"Yes, but they had to go, and they wouldn't listen to me any other way. We need to go, now!"
It Ain't Easy Being Breezies,Natasha Levinger,fluttershy,"My dear Breezies, I had to rescue Seabreeze from serious harm, and now I know more than ever that you must leave before it's too late! You would never survive in Ponyville."
It Ain't Easy Being Breezies,Natasha Levinger,rainbow dash,It's too strong!
It Ain't Easy Being Breezies,Natasha Levinger,rainbow dash,"Fly back! I'm gonna try and see if I can slow it down. Now it's too light! Oh, this will never get them home!"
It Ain't Easy Being Breezies,Natasha Levinger,fluttershy,"Oh, my. Maybe it's because there are too few of them. When they started their journey, there was more of them to face the breeze together."
It Ain't Easy Being Breezies,Natasha Levinger,twilight sparkle,"I've been studying an old spell book from the Castle of the Two Sisters. There's a spell that I think could help us! This is probably gonna feel a little funny at first, but you're gonna have to trust me."
It Ain't Easy Being Breezies,Natasha Levinger,pinkie pie,I love new ideas that make me feel funny at first!
It Ain't Easy Being Breezies,Natasha Levinger,fluttershy,"Maifo flai batendud! [high-pitched] Um, I mean, let's go!"
It Ain't Easy Being Breezies,Natasha Levinger,rainbow dash,[high-pitched] Holy mini-sized paradise!
It Ain't Easy Being Breezies,Natasha Levinger,rarity,[high-pitched] This is simply beautiful! So much inspiration. Where's my sketchpad when I need it?
It Ain't Easy Being Breezies,Natasha Levinger,pinkie pie,[high-pitched] So...stinkin'...cute!
It Ain't Easy Being Breezies,Natasha Levinger,applejack,"[high-pitched] You okay, Fluttershy?"
It Ain't Easy Being Breezies,Natasha Levinger,fluttershy,[high-pitched] I'm just so very happy they got to be reunited with their family!
It Ain't Easy Being Breezies,Natasha Levinger,rarity,"[high-pitched] We'd better get going before the entrance- well, exit for us, closes."
It Ain't Easy Being Breezies,Natasha Levinger,fluttershy,"[high-pitched] Goodbye, Breezies. I must go now."
It Ain't Easy Being Breezies,Natasha Levinger,fluttershy,"[high-pitched] Thank you! I'll miss you. I'll miss all of you! [voiceover, normal] My experiences with the Breezies have helped me to see that kindness can take many forms, and sometimes being too kind can actually keep a friend from doing what they need to do. Pushing them away may seem cruel, but it's sometimes the kindest thing you can do."
It Ain't Easy Being Breezies,Natasha Levinger,rainbow dash,[high-pitched] Whoa! That was a close one!
It Ain't Easy Being Breezies,Natasha Levinger,twilight sparkle,"[high-pitched] Okay, gather round."
It Ain't Easy Being Breezies,Natasha Levinger,rainbow dash,"So, uh, I've always kinda wondered what it would be like to be a griffon."
It Ain't Easy Being Breezies,Natasha Levinger,twilight sparkle,Not a chance.
It Ain't Easy Being Breezies,Natasha Levinger,rainbow dash,You sure? What about a dragon? No? It doesn't have to shoot fire!
Somepony to Watch Over Me,Scott Sonneborn,scootaloo,"Whatever they decide, Apple Bloom, we'll be here for you."
Somepony to Watch Over Me,Scott Sonneborn,sweetie belle,"Totally. Even though it could change everything for you, forever and ever!"
Somepony to Watch Over Me,Scott Sonneborn,granny smith,"So, we here have decided... that you're old enough to stay home alone and take care of the chores yourself for the afternoon!"
Somepony to Watch Over Me,Scott Sonneborn,apple bloom,I accept your decision.
Somepony to Watch Over Me,Scott Sonneborn,apple bloom,"Stayin' home alone, by myself, on my own! I can't believe I'm really doin' it!"
Somepony to Watch Over Me,Scott Sonneborn,applejack,"Now, hey there, filly. I know you're excited, but bein' the only pony here to take care of the day's chores is a big responsibility."
Somepony to Watch Over Me,Scott Sonneborn,apple bloom,I know it! And it means everythin' to me that y'all think I'm grown up enough to handle it. I won't let you down.
Somepony to Watch Over Me,Scott Sonneborn,granny smith,"Well, if'n I'm gonna make my train, I best to be off. When Great Aunt Pine Apple says a pony's gots to ride by a certain time, you better be there! You be sure and take care now, Apple Bloom. Y'all take care as well. I don't know which of your delivery routes is tougher. you're each headed to a mighty hard-to-reach town."
Somepony to Watch Over Me,Scott Sonneborn,big mcintosh,Eeyup.
Somepony to Watch Over Me,Scott Sonneborn,applejack,"We know, Granny. That's the only reason I agreed to let Apple Bloom stay behind alone."
Somepony to Watch Over Me,Scott Sonneborn,apple bloom,It is?
Somepony to Watch Over Me,Scott Sonneborn,applejack,"Oh, I didn't mean it like that, sugarcube. It's just, I take my job as your big sister real serious, which is why I spent all night makin' this."
Somepony to Watch Over Me,Scott Sonneborn,apple bloom,What is it?
Somepony to Watch Over Me,Scott Sonneborn,applejack,Just a little list of helpful reminders.
Somepony to Watch Over Me,Scott Sonneborn,apple bloom,"[reading] ""There's some soup for you in the 'frigerator. Be sure not to heat it up too much. If it's hot, blow on it to cool it off. And take little sips <U+0097> if you gulp, you could get hiccups."" You don't have to worry about me. I can take care of myself and the chores! I'm ready for this."
Somepony to Watch Over Me,Scott Sonneborn,applejack,[sighs] I guess you are. I'm just not so sure I am.
Somepony to Watch Over Me,Scott Sonneborn,apple bloom,"But you trust me and believe I'm grown up enough to handle this, right?"
Somepony to Watch Over Me,Scott Sonneborn,applejack,"[sighs] Right. Okay then. Good luck, little sis<U+0097> whoa!"
Somepony to Watch Over Me,Scott Sonneborn,apple bloom,[quickly] Okaygreatseeyousoonbye!
Somepony to Watch Over Me,Scott Sonneborn,big mcintosh,Eyuu-up!
Somepony to Watch Over Me,Scott Sonneborn,apple bloom,Woo-hoo! I'm alone! At home! I'm home alone! This is gonna be so awesome!
Somepony to Watch Over Me,Scott Sonneborn,applejack,"Eheheh... Sorry, Big Mac. I was just frettin' a bit about Apple Bloom. You think she's gonna be okay on her own?"
Somepony to Watch Over Me,Scott Sonneborn,big mcintosh,Eeyup.
Somepony to Watch Over Me,Scott Sonneborn,applejack,"I just keep on thinkin' of things I forgot to put on her list. Like, I didn't write down that if she wants to get a spoon out of the drawer, she needs to open the drawer first. [sighs] I know, I'm probably just bein' silly."
Somepony to Watch Over Me,Scott Sonneborn,big mcintosh,Eeyup.
Somepony to Watch Over Me,Scott Sonneborn,applejack,"But I know I'd feel a heap better if I could just check on Apple Bloom one last time. You go on ahead and make your delivery. I'm just gonna take a quick peek, and then I'll make mine."
Somepony to Watch Over Me,Scott Sonneborn,apple bloom,"Okay, number one seventy two: ""Make sure to pump the bellows to keep the stove warm."""
Somepony to Watch Over Me,Scott Sonneborn,apple bloom,"Check! ""Make sure the hats and bows closet is fully stocked."" Check! [spits] That's everything on Applejack's list! And now that my chores are done, since there's no one else here, I get to make all the decisions! If I wanna listen to music, I can! If I wanna read a book, I can! If I wanna just stand here in the kitchen talkin' to myself, I can!"
Somepony to Watch Over Me,Scott Sonneborn,applejack,Apple Bloom!
Somepony to Watch Over Me,Scott Sonneborn,apple bloom,Whoa!
Somepony to Watch Over Me,Scott Sonneborn,apple bloom,Ugh... Applejack?
Somepony to Watch Over Me,Scott Sonneborn,applejack,"I came back to check on you, and I'm so glad I did! I never thought about how dangerous things are around here!"
Somepony to Watch Over Me,Scott Sonneborn,apple bloom,"Thanks, but I'm really gonna be okay."
Somepony to Watch Over Me,Scott Sonneborn,applejack,You are now! Because I'm here and I'm stayin'! No way am I leavin' my little baby sister home alone all by herself!
Somepony to Watch Over Me,Scott Sonneborn,apple bloom,I'm not a baby! I can take care of myself! And what about those pies you're supposed to deliver?
Somepony to Watch Over Me,Scott Sonneborn,applejack,Pies? Ha! Family's way more important than pies!
Somepony to Watch Over Me,Scott Sonneborn,apple bloom,But I'm fine! And actually... this was kind of your fault.
Somepony to Watch Over Me,Scott Sonneborn,applejack,I know. I should never have left you alone.
Somepony to Watch Over Me,Scott Sonneborn,apple bloom,"But I don't need you lookin' after me. I'm perfectly capable of stayin' home alone. Really! Just look! ""There's some soup for you in the 'frigerator."""
Somepony to Watch Over Me,Scott Sonneborn,applejack,What was that?
Somepony to Watch Over Me,Scott Sonneborn,apple bloom,Watch me!
Somepony to Watch Over Me,Scott Sonneborn,apple bloom,Whoa! Ugh!
Somepony to Watch Over Me,Scott Sonneborn,applejack,"Oh, no! This is worse than I thought! Well, don't worry, Apple Bloom, I'm here now and I'm not leavin' you home alone ever again. I'm stickin' right by your side, always!"
Somepony to Watch Over Me,Scott Sonneborn,applejack,Apple Bloom? Apple Bloom!
Somepony to Watch Over Me,Scott Sonneborn,apple bloom,Applejack's just overreactin' a bit. I'm sure she'll snap out of it. Whoa!
Somepony to Watch Over Me,Scott Sonneborn,applejack,You need somethin'? I'm right here!
Somepony to Watch Over Me,Scott Sonneborn,apple bloom,"I know you mean well, but I don't need you watchin' over me! I can take care of things myself!"
Somepony to Watch Over Me,Scott Sonneborn,apple bloom,Look! Huh? Hey! Who put pillows on this rake?
Somepony to Watch Over Me,Scott Sonneborn,applejack,"[chuckles] Oh, I don't know. Maybe someone who really loves her little sister and doesn't want her to get an owie?"
Somepony to Watch Over Me,Scott Sonneborn,apple bloom,Hm? Hm.
Somepony to Watch Over Me,Scott Sonneborn,apple bloom,"Oh, for the love of...! [sighs] You've gone and baby-proofed everythin'!"
Somepony to Watch Over Me,Scott Sonneborn,applejack,"Heh, yup! Your big sister let you down once, but I promise it won't ever happen again."
Somepony to Watch Over Me,Scott Sonneborn,apple bloom,"But really, I'm fine! I can take care of myself. I don't need you watchin' over me!"
Somepony to Watch Over Me,Scott Sonneborn,applejack,"Aw, that's sweet. I appreciate you tryin' to make me feel better, but don't worry. I'll always be here for you. Always!"
Somepony to Watch Over Me,Scott Sonneborn,apple bloom,[sighs] And that's the reason I asked y'all to come over quick.
Somepony to Watch Over Me,Scott Sonneborn,applejack,"Hey, Apple Bloom! You need anything? A snack? A hoof massage? Maybe a snack while havin' a hoof massage?"
Somepony to Watch Over Me,Scott Sonneborn,sweetie belle,"Why, that sounds delightful!"
Somepony to Watch Over Me,Scott Sonneborn,apple bloom,[through gritted teeth] No thank you!
Somepony to Watch Over Me,Scott Sonneborn,applejack,"O-kay, well you can count on me bein' close by if'n you need anythin'!"
Somepony to Watch Over Me,Scott Sonneborn,apple bloom,"[sighs] You see what I mean? If this keeps up, I'm never gonna be able to do anythin' without Applejack hoverin' over me!"
Somepony to Watch Over Me,Scott Sonneborn,scootaloo,So what can we do? Hmm.
Somepony to Watch Over Me,Scott Sonneborn,sweetie belle,Uh...
Somepony to Watch Over Me,Scott Sonneborn,scootaloo,Um...
Somepony to Watch Over Me,Scott Sonneborn,apple bloom,Hang on a sec! I got it!
Somepony to Watch Over Me,Scott Sonneborn,sweetie belle,What?
Somepony to Watch Over Me,Scott Sonneborn,apple bloom,"The pies! I'll sneak out and deliver them! Granny said that they were goin' to some incredibly hard-to-reach town. If I can do it alone, that'll show Applejack I don't need somepony watchin' over me!"
Somepony to Watch Over Me,Scott Sonneborn,scootaloo,Just one problem. Your sister's gonna come back and check on you any minute!
Somepony to Watch Over Me,Scott Sonneborn,sweetie belle,Which means you need an escape plan.
Somepony to Watch Over Me,Scott Sonneborn,scootaloo,"Ooh, and I got an idea for one! [mocks snoring] See? It'll look just like you're sleeping in bed. Sweetie and I can take turns! That way, when one of us gets tired, the other can take over. Brilliant, huh?"
Somepony to Watch Over Me,Scott Sonneborn,sweetie belle,Mm-hm!
Somepony to Watch Over Me,Scott Sonneborn,apple bloom,You know what? It is! I got a feelin' this just might work! We're gonna make my sister see I don't need her watchin' over me<U+0097>
Somepony to Watch Over Me,Scott Sonneborn,scootaloo,Stop! No time for a song! Applejack's coming!
Somepony to Watch Over Me,Scott Sonneborn,sweetie belle,"If you're gonna go, we've gotta get you out of here now!"
Somepony to Watch Over Me,Scott Sonneborn,apple bloom,"Cutie Mark Crusaders, let's do it!"
Somepony to Watch Over Me,Scott Sonneborn,apple bloom,Whoa!
Somepony to Watch Over Me,Scott Sonneborn,applejack,"[muffled] Everythin' okay in there, sugarcube?"
Somepony to Watch Over Me,Scott Sonneborn,scootaloo,"Quick, get in while I hide! Sweetie, no! You gotta sleep like Apple Bloom!"
Somepony to Watch Over Me,Scott Sonneborn,sweetie belle,How does she sleep?
Somepony to Watch Over Me,Scott Sonneborn,scootaloo,Like she does everything! With sass!
Somepony to Watch Over Me,Scott Sonneborn,applejack,"Huh. I guess you must've been so tuckered out, you sent your friends home and went to bed. Then again, you are a delicate flower. [sighs] Sleep tight, Apple Bloom. I'll check on you again in a bit."
Somepony to Watch Over Me,Scott Sonneborn,applejack,Just checkin' in on you again!
Somepony to Watch Over Me,Scott Sonneborn,applejack,Need anythin' now?
Somepony to Watch Over Me,Scott Sonneborn,applejack,How 'bout now?
Somepony to Watch Over Me,Scott Sonneborn,applejack,Need another blanket?
Somepony to Watch Over Me,Scott Sonneborn,applejack,Did I hear a cough?
Somepony to Watch Over Me,Scott Sonneborn,applejack,Want a glass of water?
Somepony to Watch Over Me,Scott Sonneborn,applejack,"[yawning] Just... checkin' in on you again. [sighs] Look at you, dozin' so peaceful-like. Here I am, checkin' up on you every five seconds, and you're totally fine. Maybe you don't need me frettin' over you all the time."
Somepony to Watch Over Me,Scott Sonneborn,scootaloo,"[gasps] [muffled] Wow, Apple Bloom will be so glad to hear that!"
Somepony to Watch Over Me,Scott Sonneborn,applejack,Huh? Scootaloo?
Somepony to Watch Over Me,Scott Sonneborn,scootaloo,"Uh, um, n-no."
Somepony to Watch Over Me,Scott Sonneborn,applejack,"Sweetie Belle? But... where's Apple Bloom? She's not here! She could be anywhere! She could be lost, cold, hungry, itchy, stuffed up, needin' to go to the bathroom!"
Somepony to Watch Over Me,Scott Sonneborn,sweetie belle,"Don't worry, we know exactly where she is."
Somepony to Watch Over Me,Scott Sonneborn,scootaloo,"Yeah, she's making your pie delivery."
Somepony to Watch Over Me,Scott Sonneborn,applejack,What?! No! Didn't she hear how difficult and dangerous it was?! [gasp] I may never see my little sister again!
Somepony to Watch Over Me,Scott Sonneborn,applejack,"Okay, Rarity's on her way here to look after you two. Now tell me, did Apple Bloom at least bring flameproof boots? A lion tamer's chair? A snake charmin' flute?! A hunk of ricotta?! [gasps] [teeth chattering] Okay, maybe there's still time to catch her before she gets there. When did she leave?"
Somepony to Watch Over Me,Scott Sonneborn,sweetie belle,It must've been hours ago.
Somepony to Watch Over Me,Scott Sonneborn,applejack,"Oh, no!"
Somepony to Watch Over Me,Scott Sonneborn,apple bloom,"Well, now at least I can see."
Somepony to Watch Over Me,Scott Sonneborn,apple bloom,[nervous whimpering] It don't look so safe to me.
Somepony to Watch Over Me,Scott Sonneborn,apple bloom,"Well, unfortunately, I gotta get these pies to a town on the other side of the swamp, so, uh..."
Somepony to Watch Over Me,Scott Sonneborn,apple bloom,No!
Somepony to Watch Over Me,Scott Sonneborn,apple bloom,"Uh, actually..."
Somepony to Watch Over Me,Scott Sonneborn,apple bloom,I really wish my sister were here!
Somepony to Watch Over Me,Scott Sonneborn,applejack,"Hang on, Apple Bloom! I'm a-comin'!"
Somepony to Watch Over Me,Scott Sonneborn,applejack,Howdy!
Somepony to Watch Over Me,Scott Sonneborn,applejack,Let's go!
Somepony to Watch Over Me,Scott Sonneborn,applejack,[panting] Are you okay?
Somepony to Watch Over Me,Scott Sonneborn,apple bloom,Thanks to you.
Somepony to Watch Over Me,Scott Sonneborn,applejack,"I told you you need your big sister lookin' after you! I'm just glad this wasn't a whole lot worse. I mean, sure we lost the cart and all the pies, but at least you're<U+0097> Huh, the cart! And all the pies! You actually got them all the way up here? In the dark? Through the Flame Geyser Swamp? Past that monster? ...By yourself?"
Somepony to Watch Over Me,Scott Sonneborn,apple bloom,Well... yeah.
Somepony to Watch Over Me,Scott Sonneborn,applejack,"Huh, wow. That's mighty impressive! Anypony who can do that on her own, well, she don't need somepony like me babyin' her."
Somepony to Watch Over Me,Scott Sonneborn,applejack,"Just remember, you fellas wouldn't be enjoyin' these pies if it weren't for my sister."
Somepony to Watch Over Me,Scott Sonneborn,apple bloom,And my sister!
Somepony to Watch Over Me,Scott Sonneborn,applejack,But this don't change the fact that tryin' to make this delivery on your own was a plumb crazy thing to do!
Somepony to Watch Over Me,Scott Sonneborn,apple bloom,I know...
Somepony to Watch Over Me,Scott Sonneborn,applejack,"[scoffs] I bet Granny Smith grounds you for a month for sneakin' out! And if Big Mac, Granny Smith 'n I ever have to be away for the day again... I would totally trust you to stay home and take care of things on your own. I guess I did get a little carried away watchin' over you, and if you hadn't snuck out like you did, maybe I wouldn't have figured that out."
Somepony to Watch Over Me,Scott Sonneborn,apple bloom,Yes! Now that is the kind of 'looking after me' that I can definitely appreciate! So... we're good?
Somepony to Watch Over Me,Scott Sonneborn,applejack,"Little sister, we're always good."
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,applejack,Has anypony heard from Pinkie Pie since yesterday?
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,rainbow dash,[yawns] I don't see what's so important we had to meet her here this early. Celestia hasn't even raised the sun yet!
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,pinkie pie,Thank goodness you're all here! There's no time to lose!
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,rarity,Whoa!
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,fluttershy,Ooh...
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,rainbow dash,Ugh! Hey- whoa!
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,pinkie pie,Careful!
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,twilight sparkle,What is all this?
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,pinkie pie,"My sister Maud's gonna be here soon, and I need your help taste-testing my rock candy recipes!"
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,applejack,"Uh, we're happy to help you, Pinkie Pie, but this seems like an awful lot of candy."
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,rarity,Even for you.
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,pinkie pie,Everypony ready for more?
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,rainbow dash,Ugh. My teeth hurt.
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,applejack,I think we've had plenty. And shouldn't you be on your way to pick up Maud from the train station?
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,twilight sparkle,Maud is your sister. I'm sure she'll love your rock candy. And I'm pretty sure you've made enough. She's only staying for the week.
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,pinkie pie,"Aw, it's not just for Maud, silly. I'm making candy for all of us!"
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,applejack,"Aw, what a great tradition."
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,rainbow dash,Hold on. The secret ingredient is rocks?
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,pinkie pie,Yeah. But these are a special kind of rock that Maud discovered.
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,fluttershy,"Oh, what kind of a rock are they?"
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,pinkie pie,"Can't tell ya that, silly! [whispering] It's a secret! [speaking normally] Now that Maud is heading out to get her rocktorate in rock science, this may be our last chance to trade them for a really long time. I can't wait for you all to meet her. I just know that my best Ponyville friends and my best sister friend are gonna become bestest friends! We can make bestest-est friend rock candy necklaces together! She expresses herself through fashion just like Rarity, and she's really smart and loves reading just like Twilight! And she's honest, and loves forest things, and is good at games, and... Well, oh, she's awesome!"
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,rarity,"[strained] She sounds amazing, but won't she start worrying if you aren't at the train station when she gets here?"
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,pinkie pie,She sure will. [gasp] I gotta get out of here!
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,fluttershy,I sure hope Maud has an appetite.
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,applejack,Never met a pony or critter who didn't love Granny Smith's apple spiced muffins!
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,rarity,"Oh, it's no use! I simply cannot find anything suitable to wear!"
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,rainbow dash,"I doubt she'll notice what anypony's wearing, so what's the big deal?"
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,rarity,The big deal is that it will be very difficult to show Maud what a strong fashion presence we have in Ponyville if the most fashion-forward pony here can't keep her hat from falling apart!
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,twilight sparkle,"I think we're all a little nervous about Maud's visit. She's Pinkie Pie's sister, and it's obvious Pinkie really wants us to hit it off. Being able to make those rock candy necklaces together is really important to her. I'm sure everything will be fine<U+0096>"
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,pinkie pie,We're heeeere!
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,twilight sparkle,Where's Maud?
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,pinkie pie,She's coming!
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,rainbow dash,Uh... you sure?
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,pinkie pie,She's not quite as fast as me. I asked Gummy to stay with her in case she got lost!
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,rainbow dash,[whispering] Is she even moving?
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,pinkie pie,"We're over here, Maud!"
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,maud pie,[sniffs] [deadpan] Hm. Sedimentary.
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,rainbow dash,Huh?
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,maud pie,[deadpan] This is a sedimentary rock.
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,twilight sparkle,"That's... really fascinating, isn't it, girls? We're just so thrilled you could come for a visit before your big trip. Pinkie Pie has told us so much about you. I'm Twilight, and this is Applejack, Fluttershy, Rainbow Dash, and Rarity."
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,fluttershy,We're ever so glad to meet you.
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,applejack,We're just gonna have the best time!
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,rarity,Pinkie Pie tells me you share my love for fashion.
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,maud pie,[deadpan] I'm really into expressing myself through my wardrobe.
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,rarity,A-and what is the delightful frock you're wearing now saying?
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,maud pie,[deadpan] It doesn't talk. It's a dress.
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,applejack,"Uh, so this here's Winona. That's Owlowiscious, Tank, Opal, and Angel. Pinkie Pie told us you have a pet, too."
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,maud pie,[deadpan] He's in my pocket.
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,fluttershy,"Oh, you have a pocket pet? Like a tiny mouse? Or a baby bird? Or a trained butterfly?"
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,maud pie,[deadpan] It's a rock. His name is Boulder.
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,pinkie pie,"This is going to be the best, most awesome, funnest week ever! I can't wait for us all to become bestest friends!"
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,applejack,Maud? Would you like to try one of Granny Smith's famous apple spiced muffins?
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,applejack,"Oh, uh, heh, that's not<U+0096> Um..."
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,maud pie,[chews] [with mouth full] [deadpan] It's crunchy.
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,pinkie pie,[chews] [with mouth full] Maud's right! They are crunchy! Yum!
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,rainbow dash,"So, uh, Pinkie Pie tells us you like games."
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,maud pie,[deadpan] Boulder and I sometimes play a game called 'Camouflage'. It's kind of like hide and seek but way more intense.
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,rainbow dash,Awesome?
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,twilight sparkle,Any luck?
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,fluttershy,"I truly wish I'd spent more time with Boulder, because I'm having a very hard time remembering what he looks like."
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,applejack,It's like looking for a pebble in a haystack.
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,rarity,More like in a pile of pebbles.
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,applejack,"Well, you don't have to make it even harder."
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,rarity,Ugh! I give up! this is impossible!
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,twilight sparkle,"It'll hurt Maud's feelings if we all stop playing. Besides, look how much fun Pinkie Pie's having."
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,pinkie pie,Is this him? Is this him? Is this him? Is this him?
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,twilight sparkle,"Just a little longer, okay?"
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,applejack,"Uh, alright, fine..."
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,rainbow dash,[simultaneously] Really?
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,maud pie,[deadpan] Found him.
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,pinkie pie,Oh! Where was he?
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,maud pie,[deadpan] He was hiding in my pocket.
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,rainbow dash,"Oh, come on!"
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,fluttershy,"I don't mean to interrupt, but we really should get these little critters home. It's getting awfully late, and they've had a very busy day."
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,pinkie pie,"Maud and I had better get going too. I want her to taste the rock candy we're gonna use for our best friends necklaces! Aw, yeah!"
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,applejack,She sure is... different from what I expected.
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,rainbow dash,"We spent all day digging in the dirt, and he was in her pocket the whole time?!"
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,fluttershy,"On the bright side, Boulder seemed really sweet."
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,rainbow dash,He's a rock!
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,twilight sparkle,"Come on, girls. I'm sure Maud was just nervous about meeting all of us."
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,applejack,Maybe she was just acting a little 'off' because she was shy or somethin'.
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,twilight sparkle,"Exactly. It must be awfully intimidating to meet all of us at once, especially since we're already such good friends."
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,twilight sparkle,"Maybe if we spend some time with her one-on-one to try to get to know her better, I'm sure we'll be making those best friend rock candy necklaces in no time."
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,rarity,Where shall we start? I've chosen a few fabrics that I think will be stunning with y<U+0096>
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,pinkie pie,"Choices, choices, choices!"
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,rarity,"...Of course, if you don't see anything that speaks to you, I would be happy to suggest<U+0096>"
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,maud pie,[deadpan] I like this one.
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,rarity,[laughs] Pinkie Pie didn't tell us you were so funny!
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,maud pie,[deadpan] What do you mean?
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,rarity,"Oh, well, it's just... I believe that is a dishtowel. [beat] B-b-but it does go very well with your complexion. I'm sure I could work my magic and turn it into something fabulous."
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,pinkie pie,Rarity and my sister working together to design something amazing! This is the best day ever!
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,rarity,Perhaps I could sew all of these together and make you something you'd like.
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,maud pie,[deadpan] No thanks. One is enough.
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,pinkie pie,Doesn't Maud make the coolest scarves?
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,rarity,Quite...
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,fluttershy,"Hello there, Hummingway. I'm ever so happy to see you."
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,pinkie pie,What's he saying?
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,fluttershy,"He says hello, and he's happy to see us too."
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,pinkie pie,"I wish I could speak hummingbird. Humm! Hum-m-m-m-m, hum!"
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,fluttershy,"[to Maud] These spiders only live in Ponyville, and even though they may look a teeny bit scary, they're actually very sweet and help keep other, more dangerous insects away!"
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,maud pie,[deadpan] I was looking at the rock.
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,fluttershy,Oh.
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,pinkie pie,"Thanks again, Fluttershy! Start thinking about which flavors you want to put on your best friend rock candy necklace!"
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,fluttershy,Oh gosh. I'm not sure we're even friends yet.
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,pinkie pie,Maud is a total bookworm. She loves poetry!
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,twilight sparkle,I've got lots of poetry. Do you read anything by Quilland Ink? Or Flourish Prose?
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,maud pie,[deadpan] I prefer to read my own poetry.
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,twilight sparkle,"Oh, I'd love to hear some of it!"
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,maud pie,[clears throat] [deadpan] Rock. You are a rock. Gray. You are gray. Like a rock. Which you are. Rock.
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,pinkie pie,She's so prolific!
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,maud pie,"[deadpan] This next one is about rocks. They're all about rocks. Rocks; these are my rocks. Sediments: make me sedimental. Smooth and round, asleep in the ground. Shades of brown and gray..."
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,applejack,"You 'bout done peelin' them apples for the cider, Maud?"
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,maud pie,[deadpan] I think this one is done.
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,maud pie,[deadpan] Should I peel another?
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,applejack,"No! I mean, nah. I'm sure there's plenty apples in it already."
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,pinkie pie,[sniffs] Can we taste it now?
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,applejack,"Sure, why not?"
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,pinkie pie,[glugs] Wow! That's the best apple cider I've ever had!
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,applejack,"What do you think, Maud?"
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,maud pie,[sips] [deadpan] It tastes like apples.
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,pinkie pie,"Told you she was super honest, just like you!"
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,applejack,"[nervously] We're practically twins, heh."
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,rainbow dash,Yeah! Let's see you beat that! Whooaa!
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,pinkie pie,That was amazing!
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,rainbow dash,Whoa. How'd you do that?
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,maud pie,[deadpan] I threw it.
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,rainbow dash,"I guess you won this one, Maud."
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,maud pie,[deadpan] I'm not really into... 'winning'.
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,pinkie pie,"Great, you're all here! Maud is out looking for rocks, so this is the perfect time for us to set up everything we'll need to make our best friend rock candy necklaces!"
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,pinkie pie,What's wrong?
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,twilight sparkle,"Well, I'm not sure it's the best time to make best friend rock candy necklaces."
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,pinkie pie,Why not?
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,twilight sparkle,Uh...
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,rarity,"Well, darling, you see..."
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,fluttershy,"You're ever so thoughtful to share your special bonding ritual with us, but, uh..."
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,pinkie pie,But what?
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,applejack,"[sighs] The truth is, we've all been tryin' real hard to get closer to Maud, but, well... maybe some ponies just don't click the way others do."
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,applejack,"We just wouldn't feel right makin' somethin' that means we're best friends if, well, we aren't."
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,pinkie pie,"[mane deflates] Oh. Okay. If anypony needs me, I'll be in here trying to figure out what to do with two hundred pounds of rock candy."
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,rarity,I feel awful! Just awful...
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,fluttershy,Maybe we should have just pretended we were friends with Maud.
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,twilight sparkle,"If we didn't tell Pinkie Pie that we hadn't all become the best of friends, I think Maud would have."
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,rainbow dash,"Maybe, but who really knows? That pony is a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an igneous."
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,rarity,"Don't you mean ""inside an enigma""?"
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,rainbow dash,Nope. I mean igneous. It's a kind of rock. Ask me how I know that.
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,pinkie pie,I've come up with just the thing to bring everypony closer together!
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,rainbow dash,Huh?
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,pinkie pie,It combines everypony's interests into one giant activity that we can all enjoy together and that will totally bring all of my bestest friends together as bestestest friends! You'll need these.
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,rainbow dash,Like I said: Huh?
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,pinkie pie,"Probably better for me to show you. Watch this! Applesauce tunnel for Applejack, pretty shiny stuff for Rarity, reading material for Twilight, critter time for Fluttershy..."
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,pinkie pie,Cupcakes for yours truly... [chomps] and it's a race for Rainbow Dash!
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,twilight sparkle,"Pinkie Pie, what is that?!"
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,pinkie pie,"A rock slide, of course! For Maud! First you climb, then you slide!"
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,applejack,I've got a bad feeling about this...
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,fluttershy,"Oh, goodness!"
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,applejack,Watch out!
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,rainbow dash,What<U+0096> how<U+0096> what?!
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,maud pie,"Pinkie Pie, what were you thinking?"
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,pinkie pie,I guess I wasn't.
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,maud pie,"I know how important it is to you that your friends become my friends, but I just don't think it's going to happen. I think it would be best if I just go back to the rock farm and spend the rest of the week there. It was nice to meet you all. Makes me happy knowing Pinkie Pie has such good friends."
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,pinkie pie,"But... we never even got to make our rock candy necklaces... Wait, Maud! I'll come with you!"
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,twilight sparkle,I can't believe Maud cut her trip short.
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,rarity,I can't believe we nearly lost Pinkie Pie to that ridiculous obstacle course.
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,fluttershy,Thank goodness Maud was able to reach her in time.
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,rainbow dash,Did you see how fast Maud moved?
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,rarity,And the way she smashed that huge rock into dust? How in Equestria did she do that?
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,fluttershy,Pinkie Pie was in trouble! Maud would move mountains for her if she had to.
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,twilight sparkle,That's it! I think I finally realized what we all have in common with Maud! Something that just might be worthy of a very important super-duper special tradition that only the closest and bestest of friends can share!
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,maud pie,Thank you for coming with me. I don't know how long I'll be gone on my rock research trip. I'm glad I still get to spend some time with you before I go.
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,pinkie pie,Me too. I'm sorry I put so much pressure on everypony to bond. I only wanted my friends to get to know my amazing older sister.
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,pinkie pie,What are you doing here?
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,twilight sparkle,"Pinkie Pie, we're so sorry we hurt your feelings by not bonding with Maud right away. And Maud, we're sorry that you felt the only way to spare Pinkie Pie's feelings was to leave Ponyville early."
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,applejack,We've seen how much you care about Pinkie Pie firsthoof.
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,twilight sparkle,"Pinkie Pie's happiness means as much to us as it does to you, and we're sorry we couldn't see it sooner. The thing that makes us click and creates a special bond between us is how much we all love Pinkie Pie!"
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,pinkie pie,"Aw, shucks!"
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,twilight sparkle,"That's a pretty great thing to have in common, if you ask me. What do you think, Maud?"
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,maud pie,Sure.
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,pinkie pie,What's wrong?
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,rarity,"Sorry, darling. I think we all just thought she'd be a bit more excited about this."
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,pinkie pie,Are you kidding me? I've never seen her more excited in my entire life!
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,maud pie,"[deadpan] I don't know if you've noticed, but I don't show my enthusiasm for things quite in the same way my sister does."
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,rainbow dash,"Uh, we noticed. And we're totally cool with it."
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,twilight sparkle,"Maud, we'd like to give you something to take on your trip, so that you remember all your friends from Ponyville."
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,maud pie,[deadpan] Thank you.
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,twilight sparkle,Are those all the necklaces Pinkie Pie sent you?
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,maud pie,[deadpan] Mm-hm.
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,twilight sparkle,You haven't eaten any of them?
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,maud pie,[deadpan] I don't really like candy. But I do love Pinkie Pie.
Maud Pie,Noelle Benvenuti,pinkie pie,[chewing] Mmm!
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,"I have to leave for dress rehearsal soon, Rarity! Is it finished yet?"
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,rarity,"Uh, not quite. I still feel it needs a certain je ne sais quoi. Perhaps it needs... appliqu<e9>s."
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,Appliqu<e9>s?
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,rarity,Or sequins.
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,Sequins!
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,rarity,"Sweetie Belle, I adore having you help me, truly I do, but..."
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,Guess I got a little carried away. It's just that I know how important it is for you to finish this wardrobe in time for Sapphire Shores and her backup dancers.
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,rarity,"This is without a doubt my most prestigious order ever. After all, Sapphire Shores is the pony of pop, and her Equestria-wide tour launches in Canterlot next week! Which means she must have these outfits by day after tomorrow at the latest!"
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,But is there time?
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,rarity,"Barely. But I work well under pressure. Hmm, as long as I stay calm, I'll be fine."
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,"Oh, good! Then maybe you could check the stitching and finish the buttons on the dresses I made for me, Apple Bloom, and Scootaloo? I really want them to look perfect, and... I think I need your expertise."
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,rarity,"My, you've been so much help to me. How could I possibly say no? When do you need them?"
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,Tomorrow night. For the opening night of our show!
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,rarity,"But, Sweetie Belle, darling! I, I'm behind as it is!"
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,I understand.
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,rarity,"I suppose... if I got a few more ponies to help me, then maybe..."
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,cheerilee,"My goodness, girls, it's time! And the audience is almost fully seated! Costumes!"
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,scootaloo,I can't believe Rarity still isn't here with the costumes.
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,She's been very busy lately!
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,apple bloom,"But how can she still not be here? She's known about this for weeks! Uh... she has known about this for weeks, right?"
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,"I kept meaning to ask her, I really did, but I worked so hard on this play. I wrote it especially for the three of us! I directed it, I'm in it, I made the costumes... It's just that this is really my time to shine doing something completely myself, and I really wanted to keep it that way!"
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,apple bloom,But we wanted everything to be perfect! All our friends came out to see it tonight!
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,cheerilee,Places!
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,rarity,"Oh, I'm here, I'm here!"
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,[gasps] You made it!
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,rarity,"Oh, I beg your pardon for cutting it so close, but I made some improvements to your original design, and I had a terrible time with these froofy sleeves. It is for the first play you ever wrote, after all, so I made quite certain it came out just so."
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,cheerilee,Places! Hello?
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,"Forsooth and anon, I cometh forthwith and posthaste with glad tidings, miladies."
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,apple bloom,Wow! A standin' ovation!
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,scootaloo,I still have goosebumps!
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,apple bloom,"This must be like a dream come true for you, huh, Sweetie Belle?"
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,scootaloo,"Ooh, can you imagine if this show was how you got your cutie mark?"
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,apple bloom,"Which do you think you'd get it for? Writing, directing, or acting?"
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,[deep breath] Let's not get carried away. We've got a whole lobby full of friends waiting to shower us with adoration and praise. Try to be gracious.
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,scootaloo,Modest.
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,apple bloom,Classy.
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,"Here we are, the stars of the show!"
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,apple bloom,You may tell us how much you loved it now.
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,scootaloo,Line forms here!
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,spike,"Wow, you guys! I think your sisters would have loved it!"
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,apple bloom,Would have?
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,spike,"They're sorry, but they had to go help Rarity get Sapphire Shores' wardrobe ready to take to Canterlot in the morning."
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,scootaloo,Even Rainbow Dash?
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,spike,Yeah. Rarity fell way behind.
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,spike,"Aw, cheer up, the show was great! I'll get you some punch."
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,At least everypony else who was able to stay loved it.
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,"What did you all like best? The writing, the directing, or the acting?"
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,"Oh, really? Which ones?"
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,[growls] Isn't there anypony here who remembers anything about the play besides the dresses?!
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,fluttershy,All of this is one headpiece?
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,rarity,"Indeed. This marvelous extravagance is the cr<e8>me de la cr<e8>me of the entire wardrobe! But alas, without this key hidden stitch, it's just a... I'm trying to think of a nicer way to say 'big bummer'. [sighs] Now perhaps we can all at last take a moment to relax!"
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,rarity,"Whatever's the matter, Sweetie Belle? Didn't the play go all right?"
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,Not even close.
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,rarity,"Oh, dear. Was something amiss with the dresses I made you?"
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,"No, they were perfect, and that was the whole problem!"
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,fluttershy,"Oh, um, I think maybe I'll go take that moment to relax now."
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,"Heh, sure do feel like relaxing!"
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,applejack,Right behind ya!
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,"How could you?! ""Oh, what amazing dresses! Oh, how I love the dresses! Ooh, dresses, dresses, dresses, dresses!"""
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,rarity,"Oh, so they did like them. [chuckles] You had me worried, you silly filly."
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,There! I knew it! You did this on purpose! Stealing the spotlight like you always do! It's my fifth birthday party all over again!
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,rarity,The... the what now?
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,Don't act like you don't remember. Or are you trying to prove you're a better actress than me too?!
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,rarity,"Sweetie Belle, if I did anything to upset you, then--"
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,Admit you made those dresses too good on purpose!
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,rarity,I thought they were supposed to be good.
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,"Yes, good. Not jaw-dropping amazing!"
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,rarity,I only tried to do what I thought you wanted.
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,Ha!
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,"Ugh, I don't believe it. After everything I put up with all week long! [imitating Rarity] ""Sweetie Belle, get me some red ribbon! No, that's not red, that's cherry! No, that's not red, that's cinnamon!"" [normal, muffled] For Pete's sake, it's all red!"
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,rarity,"[to Opalescence] I should probably go talk to her, hm?"
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,"[muffled] At least Sapphire Shores won't be all like ""Ooh, who fetched you that red ribbon? Because I don't care about anything else you made. All I care about is that amazing red ribbon!"""
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,rarity,Perhaps waiting would be best.
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,[gulping water] I wish there was a way I could take back all the work I did!
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,[growls] Now what?
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,Don't go!
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,Stop! Why do you have to ruin everything?!
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,princess luna,Enough!
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,Princess Luna! It's really you! Or am I dreaming?
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,princess luna,What do you think?
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,"Let me see. You just rescued me from a maniacal laughing Rarity-cloud. Yeah, probably dreaming."
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,princess luna,"I understand what you're going through, Sweetie Belle. I too have a sister who often shines more brightly than me, and with this, I have struggled."
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,"Wait, come back! Luna? Can you hear me? Thank you for what you did! Help, Luna! Luuuna!"
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,"I remember this. This is my fifth birthday party! I decided to make a grand entrance. I made myself all beautiful, just like my big sister."
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,"Finally, I was perfect, and then went to the stairs to enter like the belle of the ball. When I finally came out of my room, I found the party going on without me."
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,"And I kept posing at the top of the stairs, waiting to be noticed, but all I heard was..."
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,rarity,"Made them myself. And of course, you'll all want cake, won't you?"
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,That's when I learned 'never try to shine with my big sister around'.
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,princess luna,But perhaps you didn't have the whole story.
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,I thought you said you understood? Luna?
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,rarity,I'm sure she'll be along in any moment.
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,rarity,"Don't go! You'll miss out on the, uh, party favors! I was going to save them 'til the end, but..."
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,rarity,"Made them myself. And of course, you'll all want cake, won't you?"
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,rarity,"Oh, no-no-no. All of these things were Sweetie Belle's idea. I just assisted with the execution."
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,I guess Rarity wasn't trying to steal the spotlight. She was trying to save my party. Luna? Luna!
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,rarity,"Should I hem the cloaks now or wait until I'm there? I could hem them now, but I might have to redo them..."
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,When was this?
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,rarity,"But if I wait until I'm in Canterlot to hem them, Sapphire Shores might not get the best first impression..."
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,Wait. This must've happened earlier tonight!
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,rarity,Ooh... Sapphire Shores is such a big star and such a stickler for details. What if everything's not perfect enough?
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,"Funny, I thought I was the only one who got worried about stuff like that."
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,rarity,"Oh, buck up, Rarity, stop this foolishness. You've done your best and left nothing to chance! All that's needed now is a good night's rest."
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,[sighs] I hope everything goes alright for her tomorrow.
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,princess luna,Hm. How curious you should say that.
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,princess luna,"Go. Go see what the future holds if you fail to rein in your worst instincts, as I once did."
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,rarity,And here it is! The cr<e8>me de la cr<e8>me--
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,Noooo!
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,rarity,The pi<e9>ce de resistance...
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,rarity,The headdress!
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,rarity,"But, but this is impossible! I, I, I checked and rechecked everything! This couldn't have happened!"
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,rarity,"Please, you must believe me!"
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,Listen to my sister!
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,[screams] I don't wanna see any more!
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,rarity,Always check and recheck!
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,rarity,"Check, recheck, recheck, then recheck!"
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,"Make it stop! Princess Luna, can you hear me?!"
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,fluttershy,"Make me a dress, Rarity, please?"
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,rarity,Go away! You know I don't do that anymore!
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,"Wake me up, Princess Luna, wake me up, wake me uuuup!"
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,Rarity? [gasps] Oh no! The box is... gone? I'm too late! She left for Canterlot!
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,The key is for you two to distract Rarity long enough for me to put the stitch back in without her noticing.
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,scootaloo,If we're not too late already.
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,apple bloom,"Oh, my gosh! I can't believe we're goin' to see Sapphire Shores! I'm such a huge fan! I know all her songs!"
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,scootaloo,'Get Your Pony On'!
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,apple bloom,"Ooh, that's one of my favorites!"
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,This isn't a trip to see Sapphire Shores! It's a trip to save my sister from a horrible future!
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,scootaloo,'Serves Her Right'!
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,[gasps] How can you say that?! Rarity doesn't deserve that at all!
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,scootaloo,"No, 'Serves Her Right' is another one of Sapphire Shores' songs!"
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,apple bloom,You seriously didn't know that? Don't you listen to her music?!
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,...I prefer show tunes.
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,rarity,"Oh, bravo! Fabulous! Magnifique!"
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,But you have to let us in! I'm Sapphire Shores' designer's sister! You have to believe us!
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,But I'm not a fan!
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,apple bloom,I am!
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,scootaloo,Me too!
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,Not helping!
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,scootaloo,[straining] Almost...
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,scootaloo,Oof!
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,"We've gotta get in there, now!"
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,rarity,"Actually, I saved the best for last!"
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,rarity,And here it is!
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,You gotta see this with the cinnamon ribbon! You'll love it!
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,rarity,Sweetie Belle?!
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,rarity,Uh... [laughs nervously] Ahem. Just a moment!
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,"Oh, good! This is just a dream!"
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,princess luna,"Actually, no. This is very much real."
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,"[sighs] Oh, Luna... I wish none of this ever happened... What am I gonna do?"
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,princess luna,Let's begin with this. And I think I know how you can even improve it.
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,rarity,"I would like to know what in the wide, wide realm of Equestria this stunt of yours is all about, and I want to know now! Do you have any idea how important this job is to me?"
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,"Actually, I do. I was upset at you for stealing the spotlight from me at the play, so I pulled out the center stitch to the headpiece so it would fall apart."
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,rarity,What?!
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,"But then I realized I didn't want your future to be ruined forever and ever, so I came back to change it before it was too late! So... here it is. It's all fixed. Please forgive me."
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,rarity,Wait... what is this?
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,Trust me. Sapphire Shores is gonna love it.
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,rarity,I promise you'll absolutely adore the headdress as soon as you see it.
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,"Look at the stitching, real close."
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,rarity,Wherever did you come up with the idea for a dolphin?
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,"Oh, it just came to me... in a dream. I'm sorry I got jealous about those dresses. I know now that you were only trying to help."
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,rarity,"Oh, Sweetie, I forgive you! But I never did get to see your play. Any chance I could catch an encore performance?"
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,"Uh, I don't think the play went all that good. To be honest, the costumes were the best part."
For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Dave Polsky,rarity,Awww!
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,apple bloom,Just one more time? Please?
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,applejack,"Alright, but this is the last one."
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,apple bloom,Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! Woooo!
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,granny smith,[spluttering] Who done that?!
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,apple bloom,"Sure wish you'd come swim with us, Granny."
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,granny smith,"Uh, sorry, dear. I just can't bring myself anywhere near that there swimmin' hole."
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,apple bloom,How come?
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,granny smith,"Well, I wasn't always this way..."
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,granny smith,"Time was, I was an aquapony all-star! In fact, I was the only Apple to ever come close to breaking the Equestria high-diving record! Falling six stories into a deep dish pie pan takes a toll on the hindquarters. Oh, I was so sore, took years before I could even look at the water again! Just the idea of swimmin' makes my whole body ache! Besides, these old legs can't even paddle fast enough to stay afloat."
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,apple bloom,"Boy, I sure would hate to be afraid of swimmin'. You think I'll ever be scared of the water?"
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,apple bloom,Aah!
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,big mcintosh,Nope.
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,apple bloom,"Wow, Granny. I can't believe you were a high diver!"
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,granny smith,The best one in Ponyville!
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,apple bloom,Do you think I could be a high diver?
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,big mcintosh,Nope.
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,applejack,Absolutely not.
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,apple bloom,But<U+0096>
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,granny smith,"Now you hold your horsefeathers, little seed! I never said bein' a high diver was a smart decision! It's incredibly dangerous!"
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,apple bloom,"I know, but<U+0096>"
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,granny smith,"But nothin'! It is the riskiest, scariest, darn-fool thing I ever did do! That's not to say I didn't wish I was still young and spry and confident, but let's leave the flyin' through the air to the Pegasi."
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,apple bloom,"Wow, when you put it that way, it doesn't sound so fun."
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,applejack,Wow. I wonder where everypony's headed.
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,applejack,Now where in Ponyville do you two think you're goin'?
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,granny smith,"Aw, quit bein' such a worry-worm and follow your ears!"
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,apple bloom,"Come on, Applejack, aren't you curious?"
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,flim,"Thank you, one and all, for your attendance, and we guarantee that your time here will not be spent in vain!"
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,flam,"In fact, we think it will prove to be the most valuable time you've ever spent!"
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,applejack,The Flim Flam Brothers! This should be interestin'.
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,big mcintosh,Eeyup.
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,flim,"Welcome, one and all, to the demonstration of a lifetime!"
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,flam,A demonstration of a better life!
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,flim,"A demonstration of a better time! And if we haven't captured your interest just yet, by the time we've finished, an unfortunate phenomenon practically guarantees that we will!"
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,flam,A phenomenon? What's that?
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,flim,"It's a circumstance perceptible by the senses, but in this case, it's the simple fact that:"
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,flam,A sickness that lies waiting there in every breath you breathe
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,flim,Disease will up and grab you as it crawls from land and sea
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,flam,It's amazing how infected that the natural world and all its things can be
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,flim,Now I understand that some of you don't think you're sick.
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,flam,But twisted hooves and aching joints don't heal all that quick.
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,flim,Consider just how dangerous this world is! You might...
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,flam,"Slip and fall, break or sprain something here tonight"
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,flim,Now I know our claims seem fantastical.
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,flam,Impractical.
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,flim,Improbable.
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,flam,Impossible.
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,flim,So we welcome every suffering pony to make their way up to the stage.
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,flam,Now don't crowd.
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,flim,And we'll prove our tonic's effectiveness before your very eyes.
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,flam,"You there! Come up here, good sir."
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,flim,"I'll wager you're tired of those crutches, my friend."
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,flam,Try taking a sip of this!
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,granny smith,Now how do ya like that?
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,applejack,I don't. There's somethin' funny about this whole thing.
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,flim,"Now some of you may suffer from feelings of despair You're old, you're tired, your legs won't work, there's graying in your hair"
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,flam,"Just listen and I'll tell you that you don't need to fear Your ears will work, your muscles tone, your eyes will see so clear"
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,flim,"It cures the reins, the spurs, and the Clydesdale fur blight."
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,flam,Hooferia and horsentery cured in just a night.
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,flim,You've got swollen hooves and hindquarters or terrible bridle-bit cleft.
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,flam,Saunter sitz and gallop plop will give your tail some heft.
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,flim,"Mane loss, hay fever, or terrible tonsillitis."
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,flam,"You heard it here, folks -- this is the only place in all of Equestria you'll find it!"
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,flim,"It can make you shorter, taller, or even grow old"
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,flam,But who'd want that?
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,flim,When with one drink
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,granny smith,SOLD!
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,flim,"Congratulations, Granny Smith! You just made the purchase of a lifetime!"
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,applejack,Are you as worried as I am?
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,big mcintosh,Eeyup.
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,apple bloom,"Boy, I just can't believe all the things that Flim Flam Tonic can do!"
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,applejack,"When somepony says somethin's too good to be true, it usually is."
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,apple bloom,You mean Granny wasted her money?
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,applejack,"Well, I don't know about that, but I don't think there's a tonic in Equestria that can make an old pony young again."
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,granny smith,Howdy!
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,apple bloom,Granny?!
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,applejack,Hang on now! We'll get ya!
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,apple bloom,"Granny, I thought you were too afraid of the water to swim! And, and what about your hip?!"
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,granny smith,"Well, I reckon it might have been a problem before I had myself a dose of that there Flim Flam Tonic!"
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,applejack,I'm not so sure that tonic really does anythin'.
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,applejack,"I'm glad you're feelin' good, but how do you know it's from the tonic?"
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,granny smith,"I looked out at the water this mornin' and I felt the same terrifyin' aches and pains I always do. But one sip of that magic elixir and it all went away! Why, I might even get a head start on my chores! What do you say, Big Mac-a-doo? Up for a little afternoon applebuckin'?"
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,big mcintosh,"Uh, no."
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,granny smith,"Oh, quit your bellyachin'!"
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,apple bloom,"Gee, it looks like that tonic works after all! I wonder what's in it."
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,applejack,I think maybe it's time we found out.
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,apple bloom,So you're just gonna walk up and ask them how it works?
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,applejack,"I guess. Though if it's a genuine cure, I don't suppose they'll be too keen on sharin' the recipe."
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,apple bloom,Wait a second! That's that same pony from before!
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,applejack,Hey!
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,applejack,"Now hold it right there, Mister...?"
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,applejack,Our Granny took some tonic and we want to know how it works.
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,apple bloom,"Granny couldn't swim before, and now she can. Just like you couldn't walk and now you can. But what are you doin' back here? I mean, if the tonic cured you and all..."
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,applejack,"...Because he's part of the act! It's time for you to tell the truth! You never needed crutches at all, did ya?"
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,applejack,Hey! Huh?
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,flim,"Well, if it isn't our most favorite Apple!"
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,flam,What brings you back to our humble abode?
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,applejack,"You two charlatans sold my Granny a bottle of tonic, and now she's off actin' like a filly again."
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,flim,What's so bad about that?
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,applejack,"If she keeps gallavantin' around like a yearlin', she's apt to drop from exhaustion or worse! What's more, I know for a fact that your friend here is dressin' up as a different pony every night so he can pretend to be cured!"
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,flam,"Well, well, well, that's quite an accusation."
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,flim,But let's say that it's true...
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,flam,Hypothetically...
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,flim,Theoretically...
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,flam,"As I understand, your Granny was a famous aquapony."
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,flim,"The star of the show, once upon a time."
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,flam,But hasn't set so much as a hoof in the water since.
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,applejack,"Until today, that's right."
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,flim,"Well, then even if our tonic were nothing more than a mixture of apple juice and beet leaves..."
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,flam,Hypothetically...
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,flim,Theoretically...
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,flam,The fact is that Granny is happier now than before she tried it.
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,applejack,I guess...
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,flim,"So, the question is..."
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,flam,Do you really want to be the pony who takes all that happiness away?
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,applejack,I...
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,apple bloom,There you are! I've been lookin' all over! Did you find out what's in the tonic?
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,applejack,"Honestly, Apple Bloom... as long as it works, I... don't suppose it really matters."
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,apple bloom,"Well, if it doesn't matter to you, then it doesn't matter to me either, sis."
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,flim,That's the spirit!
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,flam,Come back anytime!
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,apple bloom,"Hey, Granny! Think you can buck me over the water?"
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,granny smith,"I don't see why not! Come on, Big Mac, toss her this way!"
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,applejack,"Granny, wait!"
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,granny smith,Woo-hoo-hoo!
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,granny smith,"Uh, what were you sayin', dear?"
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,applejack,"Granny, don't you think you should take it kinda easy?"
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,granny smith,"I've been takin' it easy for too long! And now, thanks to that Flim Flam Tonic, I don't have to!"
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,apple bloom,"Granny, you think I could be an aquapony like you?"
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,granny smith,"Of course you can, sapling. There's nothin' to it but to do it!"
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,apple bloom,"Well, the Ponyville swim meet is comin' up. We could enter together! A legendary water pony like you? We'd be a cinch to win!"
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,granny smith,"Mm, ee, uh, I don't know... Bein' back in the water is one thing, but a competition is a pony of a different color."
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,apple bloom,Oh. Okay.
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,applejack,"I don't know, Granny. A swim meet sounds pretty safe. And after all, if that tonic lets you swim in a river and a swimmin' hole, a pool should be no problem at all."
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,granny smith,"Well, I'll be a tart turnover, you are right! All we need now is more tonic!"
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,flam,"Welcome, friends, and step right up! The next show starts in five minutes!"
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,flim,But why not buy your tonic now and avoid the rush?
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,flam,"Right this way, good sir!"
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,granny smith,We'll take the whole case!
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,applejack,It seems to work for Granny.
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,flim,"You heard it here first, folks! Flim Flam Miracle Curative Tonic is Granny Smith-tested and Applejack-approved!"
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,applejack,"Just remember, you two. The most important thing is to be safe and have fun, right?"
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,granny smith,"Fiddlesticks! With the routine we've been workin' on, I'll be a plum puddin' if we don't win this thing!"
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,applejack,"Uh... good luck, then!"
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,granny smith,"Luck? Pfft, who needs luck? We got tonic on our side!"
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,flam,Flim Flam's Magical Curative Tonic!
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,flim,Get your Applejack-approved tonic! Granny Smith drinks it <U+0096> why shouldn't you?
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,applejack,[sighs] Right.
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,granny smith,"Now, if'n you'll excuse us, we got some swimmin' to do!"
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,applejack,"Well, I'll be..."
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,granny smith,"Yeah, but mostly it's the tonic!"
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,flim,"That's Flim Flam Miracle Curative Tonic, to be precise."
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,flam,Buy it now while supplies last.
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,applejack,What are you doin' here?
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,applejack,If you say so.
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,applejack,Thanks to... me?
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,apple bloom,"With Flim Flam's magical Curative Tonic, my Granny can do anything! Just ask Applejack!"
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,applejack,"No! This has gotta stop! If ponies keep believin' that tonic can do things it can't, who knows what'll happen?"
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,applejack,[gasps] Granny! What in blazes does she think she's doin'?!
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,apple bloom,Granny's gonna break the Equestria high divin' record!
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,applejack,Land sakes!
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,granny smith,[yelps] Now what in tarnation did you do that for?!
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,applejack,That was the most fool-pony thing I've ever seen anypony do in all my life! You can't do a dive like that!
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,granny smith,"Oh, quit your fussin'! I had enough tonic to do a dive ten times as high!"
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,flim,"Twenty times, by my count."
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,flam,"Thirty, with a favorable breeze."
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,applejack,"I hate to disappoint everypony, but there's no way Granny could have made that dive, because this tonic is a fake!"
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,applejack,...I am.
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,applejack,"I didn't mean to! But everypony seemed so much happier, I couldn't bring myself to tell you when I found out the tonic wasn't real. I know it was wrong. I just hope with time, I can win back everypony's trust."
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,apple bloom,"But if the tonic is a fake, then how come Granny can swim again, and what about all that aquabatics stuff we just did?"
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,applejack,"I reckon sometimes you can forget what you're capable of, and it just takes a little extra confidence to remember that it was inside of you all along. But tellin' ponies your tonic can do things it can't is just wrong!"
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,flim,But you just said it boosts confidence!
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,flam,"And that's not all it does, folks<U+0096>"
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,applejack,"Believin' in somethin' can help you do amazin' things. But if that belief is based on a lie, eventually it's gonna lead to real trouble."
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,applejack,I don't know...
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,applejack,"I'm sorry, Granny. I hope this doesn't mean you'll stop swimmin'."
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,granny smith,"Why in tarnation would I do that? I just can't believe those two salesponies had me believin' I could near fly! Hey, where'd they go?"
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,applejack,"Bein' honest sure gets hard when it seems like the truth might hurt somepony you care about. But I think believin' a lie can end up hurtin' even more. Maybe some ponies don't care about that <U+0096> but I sure ain't one of them. Now you take it easy there, Granny!"
Leap of Faith,Josh Haber,granny smith,"Oh, I plan to! Hoo, ha, ha-whee!"
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,[reading] The magical properties of this spell will only have lasting effects if you focus on<U+0097>
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,No! Rainbow Dash! [grunts] How in Equestria does that pony expect to pass her history of the Wonderbolts exam tomorrow if she's wasting time flying?! I'm just gonna fly right up to her and tell her what I think about her lackadaisical approach to studying! Won't she be surprised!
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,Surprise!
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,What? Huh? How did you<U+0097>
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,"Puh-lease, Twilight. That was the worst sneak attack ever."
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,Wha? But<U+0097>
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,I saw you giving me the stink-eye from the ground and heard you flying towards me and muttering from a mile away.
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"Well, if you heard me ""muttering"", then you must know what I was ""muttering"" about."
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,"Yeah, yeah, the Wonderbolts history test. No big deal."
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"No. Big deal. Really big deal. It's a test! A test that will determine if you can join the newly-formed Wonderbolts Reserves, and being part of the Wonderbolts Reserves means you'll have the opportunity to live your dream as a Wonderbolt! This is the most important test of your life!"
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,"Twilight, not everypony gets all freaked out about tests like you."
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"I do not get ""all freaked out"" about tests!"
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,"Uh, seriously? Your freakouts are so epic, you sing whole freakout arias about freaking out."
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"Fine, I may tend to take my tests a little seriously, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't be studying for yours! Oooh! And I know just the pony who can help you: me! This is gonna be so much fun!"
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,Sure. Fun.
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,[yelps] Wha<U+0096> huh?
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,This is the most complete<U+0097>
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,And ginormous!
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,<U+0097>book on the history of the Wonderbolts.
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,"Okay, but how am I supposed to get what's in there into here?"
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"With my handy-dandy study checklist, of course!"
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,Of course.
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"First up, reading and highlighting. Reading and highlighting is the foundation of any good study method. It allows the student to hone in and boil down on what's really important, separating the good from the bad, the wheat from the chaff, getting to the crux of things. Let's see what you've got so far!"
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,Um...
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"Huh? Hm, by highlighting everything, you don't really separate the wheat from the chaff... Or the good from the bad. Hey, I am not that tall!"
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"[sighs] Okay, Rainbow, clearly reading and highlighting is not your style of studying, so let's move on to the tried and true: History lecture! Yes, Rainbow?"
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,Is it snack time?
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,No.
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,Recess?
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,No.
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,[sighs] Can't we just watch the history of the Wonderbolts movie?!
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"No! Now, just get comfortable, and experience the magic of learning. Ahem. Prior to the great Celestia/Luna rift, there was no need for the Earth, Unicorn, Pegasi, or E.U.P., Guard."
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"But after Luna's banishment, the Protective Pony Platoons were formed. On the anniversary of the first Celestial year of peace, a celebration was held."
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"Headed by General Firefly, an elite team of aerial performers were chosen to help celebrate this auspicious occasion. The first performance was so full of energy, so highly charged, that magical lightning showered down on the crowd. Everypony was so filled with amazement and wonder that General Firefly dubbed them ""the Wonderbolts""!"
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"Rainbow Dash, can you repeat any of my lesson?"
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"History lecture... nope. [sighs] Okay, Rainbow<U+0096> Rainbow? Rainbow Dash!"
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,Here!
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,Let's move on to my favorite style of learning: flashcards!
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,"Oh, does that mean I'll learn in a flash?"
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"One can only hope. [inhales] Colonel Purple Dart, the leader of the Wonderbolts in the Fourth Celestial Era, was known for his<U+0096> wha?! Rainbow! Did you see what happened?"
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,What? No! I was... riveted by your captivating cards!
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"Hmm... After becoming the official flying squadron for Princess Celestia, she honored them with<U+0096> Gotcha!"
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,Got what?
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"The original Wonderbolts lightning bolt insignia was<U+0096> [yelps] Rainbow Dash, you could've hurt me!"
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,With a spit wad? Really?
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,A spit wad to the eye would have been no laughing matter!
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"Well, if you can horse around like this, then you clearly must be ready for the test."
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,Clearly.
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"Well then, I guess you're also ready for a..."
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,Pop quiz!
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,Bring it!
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,The initials E.U.P. stand for what?
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,Ernie's undercooked pancakes.
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,The original aerial team performed for...?
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,Celestia's cereal celebration.
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,The Wonderbolts were given their name by this famous Pegasus. Who is she? [to herself] Please don't say Colonel Waffle...
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,"Hello? General Blazing Donut Glaze! [scoffs] So, did I ace it or what?"
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,Or what. You didn't get one answer correct.
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,What? But<U+0096> but how?
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,I don't know. I've never heard answers so wrong! And so breakfast-related!
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,If you had taken the official test today...
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,[gasps] My dreams of being in the Wonderbolts Reserve would have been totally crushed! [gasps] What am I gonna do? I'm running out of time! I don't know any of this history! I'm gonna fail!
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,"I'm gonna fail, I'm gonna fail, I'm gonna fail! And it's all your fault!"
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,My fault?! I'm the one helping you!
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,"Maybe your famous study methods aren't all they're cracked up to be, eh, teacher?!"
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"Excuse me, I've used them to study for many a test and passed!"
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,"Yeah, right."
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,Do you know the name of the premiere Wonderbolts choreographer?
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,"Uh, well<U+0097>"
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,Commander Easyglider. Do you know how many Pegasi flew in the original squad?
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,Um<U+0097>
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,Seven! Do you know Princess Celestia's favorite flight pattern?! The Icaranian Sun Salutation! See? I could pass the test.
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,"Fine! Rub it in, why don't ya? Besides, I don't see why I have to take this lousy test anyway. I've proven I'm one of the best flyers around."
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,Knowing their origin and being able to properly represent them for all of Equestria is just as important.
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,"Yeah, right. Some history buff like you must have made that up to bring us flyers down."
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"Knowing history actually is beneficial, Rainbow."
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,[blows raspberry] Beneficial for eggheads!
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,fluttershy,Girls.
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"Well, this egghead knows history and can fly. Maybe I should become a Wonderbolt."
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,"Just 'cause you've got wings, doesn't mean you can fly!"
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,fluttershy,Girls!
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,You're barely able to just get off the ground!
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,fluttershy,"Girls! Stop! Now, is that any way to talk to a friend?"
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,Sorry.
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,"Yeah, sorry."
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,fluttershy,Don't you have more important things to do? Like prepare Rainbow for her big test?
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"I've tried everything, Fluttershy, but none of my study methods work for her."
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,fluttershy,"Well, no offense to your teaching methods, Twilight, but I think I may have a way to help Rainbow."
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,"Oh, who's that, who's that?"
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,fluttershy,"Celestia and Luna, back when they were happy."
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,Uh... now what?
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,fluttershy,"Gummy's an Earth pony, Winona's a unicorn, and Tank is a Pegasus."
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"They're the E.U.P., helping to protect the Princess."
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,"Uh, how are you getting all this?"
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,fluttershy,"Oh, no!"
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,"Stop, stop, stop! That was aw<U+0097>"
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"Awesome! I give it three woohoo's! Woohoo, woohoo, woohoo! And an extra ""woo"" for good measure! Woo!"
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,"Well, I give it a ""whoa, whoa, what?"" I'm totally confused and I just wanna go home... Whoa<U+0096> hey!"
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"Whoa your woes there, woeful. Some ponies learn through theatrical presentation, but other ponies learn through musical intervention."
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"[beatboxing, turntable scratching noises] Well, back in ancient times, there were the Wonderbolts of old A general named Firefly, amazing and so..."
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"She brought them all together, spreading unity..."
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,Performing at their very best with wonder...
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,There's Admiral Fairweather and the Colonel Purple...
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,Gave Wonderbolts a bit of steel along with...
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,An admiral named Fairy Flight and general called...
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,Helped the 'bolts fly super high...
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,Commander Easyglider was the real cream of...
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"For with her wicked moves, the Wonderbolts..."
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"Wonderbolts, yeah! Wonderbolts..."
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"Wonderbolts, yeah! Wonderbolts..."
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,That is my rappin' history of the Wonderbolts!
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"So, d'you get it?"
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,"Yes, Pinkie Pie! [poorly imitating rap-style sounds] General This and Colonel That, they're the Wonderbolts, something that rhymes with that!"
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,That... was pretty terrible.
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,What?! No... really? But I've gotta learn this stuff! Now!
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,And I am just the pony to help!
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,"Rarity, you look ridiculous."
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,I am going to ignore that comment out of my desire to help you.
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,Good luck.
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,"Get ready, Rainbow Dash, for I am going to take you on an historical adventure in fashion! I am now modeling the rather unattractive, and frankly itchy, original Wonderbolts flying costume. Fortunately, thanks to the vision of Flair d'Mare, the Wonderbolts ensemble became more streamlined in a wonderfully breathable fabric. Of course, there were fashion hits... and misses. Just look at those dreadful bell-bottoms. What were ponies thinking?"
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,I dunno. I bet General Flash rocked these thangs!
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,"[yelps] Pinkie, you're real!"
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"Of course I'm real! I mean I'm not the real General Flash, the tenth leader of the Wonderbolts, but I, Pinkie, am really real."
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,fluttershy,"And I'm Admiral Fairy Flight, from the seventh squadron."
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,And of course you recognize Commander Easyglider.
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,And I'm sportin' some sort of getup worn by Colonel Purple Dart.
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,Just look at us.
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,Look at us.
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,Look at me!
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,It's too much for my eyes!
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"Now, don't you fret, Rainbow. This fashion show nonsense wouldn't help me learn nothin', either."
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,"Really? Well, what special study trick do you have, AJ?"
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"Who, me? Oh, I got nothing."
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"Why, I could tell you every little thing there is to know about the history of apples, but I picked all that up over years in the field as a labor of love. How much time you got?"
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,Twelve hours.
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"Oh, then you are up a creek."
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"Oh, I think we should just go back to old-fashioned studying."
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,fluttershy,What about our play?
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,Just look at these costumes! Surely something resonates with your inner Wonderbolt!
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"And Granny Smith discovered the first granny smith in Fillydelphia, when she was just a filly!"
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,Commander Easyglider was the real cream of the crop<U+0097>
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"Pinkie, stop rapping! That isn't gonna help Rainbow!"
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"Well, I suggest you put down your silly cards of flash, For I know that they cannot help our good friend Rainbow Dash!"
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,"Enough! No rapping, no cards, no costumes, no play, and no apples! I am never gonna pass this test, ever! Just forget it!"
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"[panting] Rainbow, I'm sorry about all that! We didn't mean to overwhelm you!"
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,It's okay. You were just trying to help. It's just too bad I'm too dumb to learn anything.
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,You are not dumb! You just learn differently!
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,"If by ""differently"" you mean ""not at all"", then you're totally right."
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"No, that's totally wrong."
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,See? Wrong again.
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,I don't know anypony that's read more Daring Do books than you.
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,"Well, that's not going to get me into the Wonderbolts."
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,And your knowledge of jokes and pranks is only rivaled by Pinkie.
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,Great. My years of being a class clown prevented me from actually learning how to learn!
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"That's not what I meant. You're smart, creative, inventive, and<U+0096> ugh! Hey! I know you're upset, but you don't need to<U+0097>"
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,Whoa... I almost slammed into that!
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,I know. You were jabbering on so much you didn't even notice.
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,But how did you notice? You were listening and talking to me the whole time!
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,"Ha-hah, you're such a rookie. An experienced flyer like me knows how to multitask."
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,While you fly?
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,"It's essential! Yes, I was paying attention to you, but was also scanning the sky and the ground for any problems."
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,Really?
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,Flying's not just flying!
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,"In order to stay safe in the sky, I've got to hear and see everything down to the littlest details. For instance, I saw Apple Bloom, Sweetie Belle and Scootaloo come out of Sugarcube Corner, and from the looks of it, they had carrot cupcakes with sprinkles. And I'm thinking Big Mac sold a huge order of apples to Filthy Rich, 'cause I heard him give a very hearty<U+0097>"
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,I always make note of everything when I fly. No biggie.
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"[gasps] Oh, my gosh!"
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,What?
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,Gotta go!
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"Thanks for meeting me, everypony."
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"What is it, Twilight?"
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,We have to help Rainbow Dash.
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,fluttershy,"Yes, but how?"
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,"We've tried every kind of studying. My way, your way..."
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,But we haven't tried Rainbow Dash's way.
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"Hmm, I'm intrigued."
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"Hey, Rainbow. Wanna go for a fly?"
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,[sighs] Sure. Got nothing better to do. Didn't we just do this?
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"Yes, but like you said, I'm such a newbie, I need all the practice I can get."
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,"Yeah, well, I'm sure you'll become a great flyer in no time. After all, you're good at everything."
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,So... what's going on?
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,"Oh, nothing. Just getting my dreams crushed."
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,Uh... read any good books lately?
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,"[sighs] Just history books. I'd tell you what they were about, but my brain is as dry as a rock."
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,Maybe I'll go work there as I have no other plans for the rest of my life.
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"Oh, come on now, Rainbow. You can't give up on your dream!"
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,"Seems my dream has given up on me. Maybe I'll learn to shine shoes, sell hats, dig ditches..."
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,Or maybe you'll be a Wonderbolt.
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,"Twilight, give it up! I have."
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"So, what do you remember about that flight?"
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,"[sighs] Nothing important. Except after Luna was banished to the moon, Celestia needed protective forces, so Earth, unicorn, and Pegasi formed the E.U.P. Guard of the Protective Pony Platoons."
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,Yes...?
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,"[getting happier] And, at the celebration of the first Celestial year of peace, an elite flying squadron performed, headed by General Firefly, who later named the group the Wonderbolts!"
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,Uh-huh...?
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,Commander Easyglider established flight choreography that is still used by the Wonderbolts today!
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,Yes!
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,I... I know the history! I know it all! But how in Equestria did that happen?
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,You learned it!
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,"Yeah, I got that! But how?"
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"Well, on our first flight, I discovered that you catalog everything that happens all around you when you're flying, without even thinking about it! Don't you see?"
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,I made use of your special skills by enlisting everypony to help you learn the history of the Wonderbolts!
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,fluttershy,"I, Princess Celestia, banish you, Princess Luna, to the moon."
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,Noooooo!
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,apple bloom,Earth!
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,sweetie belle,Unicorn!
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,scootaloo,Pegasus!
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,apple bloom,E!
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,sweetie belle,U!
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,scootaloo,P!
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,big mcintosh,Eeyup!
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,fluttershy,Let us celebrate our first Celestial year of peace!
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"Yeah, let's party! I'm General Firefly! Gee, my costume is itchy and unattractive, but I'm gonna assemble an awesome flying team!"
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,I'll call them... the Wonderbolts!
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,Streamlined style by Flair d'Mare!
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,fluttershy,The history of the Wonderbolts!
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,"Oh my gosh, oh my gosh, oh my gosh! Thank you! Thank you all so much!"
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"You're welcome, but it all came from you. You learned without knowing you're learning. Your main focus is flying, but then your brain is also absorbing lots of other information! It's actually really brilliant!"
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,"Ha, I always knew I was brilliant!"
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"Rainbow Dash finally learned the history of the Wonderbolts, but she's not the only pony that needed a lesson; I needed to learn something just as important. One way of learning isn't better than another. After all, every pony is unique and individual."
"Testing Testing 1, 2, 3",Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,Yeeeaah! Whoo!
Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,pinkie pie,[squeals] Yes! Best day ever! We're all going to the Rainbow Falls Traders Exchange! And not just going <U+0096> we're accompanying a princess on an official royal duty!
Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,twilight sparkle,"Please, it's not that big of a deal. There always has to be a princess at the Exchange. Last year was Princess Cadance, this year it's me. It's just a formality. I'm sure none of the other ponies will even notice I'm here."
Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,applejack,"Could be wrong, but I think they might've noticed."
Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,fluttershy,"Oh, my goodness!"
Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,rarity,You said it. The Rainbow Falls Traders Exchange is simply divine. You can get anything you want here!
Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,applejack,If'n you got the goods to trade for it.
Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,spike,"[grunts] Wha? Nooo! Thanks, Twilight. Whew. One ding, nick or dent, and this Power Ponies comic book wouldn't be in perfect mint condition anymore. And if you want to trade for a mint comic, you gotta have a mint comic."
Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,applejack,I guess a pony who's here on official princess business has to expect a little fussin'.
Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,rainbow dash,"There's a pony here who's got a signed first edition of Daring Do and the Quest for the Sapphire Statue, and I'm gonna get it! I've been able to get first editions of all of the Daring Do books, except this one! Nopony's ever put together a whole set, and I'm gonna be the first! If it hasn't been traded yet... It's the only one in all of Equestria!"
Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,fluttershy,"Oh no! I'd really hate to see you disappointed. I did want to trade this bear call I've got for a bird whistle, but getting that book seems so important to you, so if you need me to help you first..."
Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,rainbow dash,"Normally I'd say I don't need any help, but you're right. This is really important. I've gotta get that book!"
Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,applejack,"Well, I'm off to take a gander at some of the vintage stalls."
Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,rarity,"Did you say vintage? Why, old and rare items are so in style right now! I'm hoping to get a vintage item as well. I just hope I brought enough to trade."
Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,applejack,"I know what you mean, Rarity. Hey! Why don't we pool our trade stashes?"
Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,rarity,Pool?
Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,applejack,"That way, if one of us finds somethin' real valuable she can't live without..."
Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,rarity,"[gasps] She'll definitely be able to get it! Who could say no to exchanging a single object for such a huge assortment of items? Oh, yes! That is absolutely brilliant! I'm so glad I have a friend like you, Applejack."
Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,applejack,I feel the same way.
Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,rarity,Then let's go shopping!
Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,pinkie pie,"Um, shouldn't your princessness be headed to the royal box seats?"
Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,twilight sparkle,"I may be the princess on duty, but I don't think that means I have to sit up there all alone doing nothing. Ever since I became a princess, Celestia's been sending me more books to read than ever. The library's overflowing, so I figured while we're here, I might as well trade away some books I don't need anymore."
Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,pinkie pie,Mm-hm!
Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,rainbow dash,"[gasps] There it is! The first edition of Daring Do and the Sapphire Statue! It hasn't been traded yet! [to stallholder] Lucky for you, because I've brought my most valuable possession to trade for it: My lucky horseshoe!"
Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,rainbow dash,What?!
Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,fluttershy,"But, but how is Rainbow Dash going to get the book she really wants?"
Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,fluttershy,"Aww, an Orthros! How cute!"
Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,rainbow dash,"You got it! [to Fluttershy] I don't know how, but somehow, we're gonna get that Orthros."
Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,rarity,"Oh, Applejack, I am so glad I found you."
Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,applejack,Me too! You're not gonna believe it!
Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,rarity,"So, where is this valuable vintage item you want to trade everything we have for?"
Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,applejack,There!
Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,rarity,Where?
Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,applejack,Right there!
Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,rarity,But... that's a dented old pie tin.
Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,applejack,A dented vintage pie tin. The metal they used to fashion this one helps cook the pies up to five seconds faster! They don't make 'em like this anymore!
Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,rarity,"I'm so glad you showed that to me, darling..."
Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,rarity,"...because once you see what I've found, you won't want to waste our trade goods on that. [giggles] Just look at this gorgeous vintage brooch. It's one of a kind!"
Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,applejack,It looks exactly like the one you're already wearin'.
Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,rarity,"Well, yes, they may look the same, but I know it's older, and that's what makes it so much more divine!"
Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,applejack,"But that doesn't make a lick of sense! Why, I'd wager if I switched them up, you wouldn't even know the difference!"
Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,rarity,"Oh, don't be silly, of course I would!"
Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,applejack,So which is the vintage one?
Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,rarity,"That one, of course."
Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,applejack,"Hah, you're bluffin'!"
Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,rarity,Am I? How can you tell?
Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,applejack,"Well... because... [groans] I can't, 'cause the one you wanna waste our whole stash on is exactly the same as the one you already got! There's no way anypony would notice the difference!"
Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,rarity,I'd say it's a lot more likely they'd notice that than some dented tin that cooked a pie a whole two seconds faster!
Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,applejack,It's five seconds faster!
Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,fluttershy,"Yes, such a good two-headed boy. Yes, you are!"
Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,rainbow dash,"Okay, I can see you're busy, so I'll give it to you straight. I need to trade this horseshoe for... that."
Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,rainbow dash,Aww.
Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,rainbow dash,A whole stand filled with Discord-shaped lamps? Seriously?!
Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,fluttershy,They really do have everything at the Traders Exchange.
Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,rainbow dash,Will you trade a lamp for my horseshoe so I can trade it for an Orthros and get my book?
Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,rainbow dash,Great! [beat] What's an antique chicken?
Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,rainbow dash,"Okay, cool! So will you trade one for a horseshoe so I can trade it for a lamp and then trade it for an Orthros so I can get my book?"
Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,rainbow dash,[panting] Hold on a sec. [inhales] We need a crystal chalice to trade for a chicken to trade for a lamp to trade for an Orthros. So what are you willing to trade for it? I'm guessing it's gotta be some crazy thing way across the Exchange.
Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,rainbow dash,"Yeah, like where am I gonna find<U+0096> wait, I've got one of those! Now that we've got the chalice, this is gonna be a cinch!"
Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,fluttershy,Do you really think so?
Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,rainbow dash,All we gotta do is bring this thing to the chicken stand and we are<U+0096>
Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,twilight sparkle,"You want me to trade all my books for a broken pen? Alright, fine. You got yourself a<U+0096>"
Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,pinkie pie,Stop! What are you doing?!
Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,twilight sparkle,I was trying to get rid of all the books I don't need anymore.
Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,pinkie pie,For that? Do you reaaaaally want that?
Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,twilight sparkle,"Well, not really, but I'm running out of library space, so<U+0096>"
Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,pinkie pie,"Ohmygosh, ohmygosh, ohmygosh! I can't believe that almost happened! But luckily, it didn't happen, thanks to me."
Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,twilight sparkle,What are you talking about?
Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,twilight sparkle,"Y'know, if you want to go check out the rest of the Exchange and trade whatever you brought..."
Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,pinkie pie,"Nope, I just came to pony-watch! I'm not going anywhere. I won't let you make a mistake like that again! Hey, everypony, step right up! Do not walk! Gallop over here for your chance to trade for authentic, one-of-a-kind, official princess merchandise!"
Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,rainbow dash,"Well, that took forever."
Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,fluttershy,I just hope it looks okay.
Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,rainbow dash,"Oh no! The pony we're supposed to trade the chicken statue to didn't tell us what kind he wanted! Okay, look. I'm fast. I'll fly over to the lamp stand and find out what kind of chicken he wants. Just don't let anypony trade for any chicken while I'm gone, okay?"
Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,fluttershy,"Um, well, okay! Um, I can do that, I think. [to Crusoe Palm] Um, well, maybe you shouldn't get one of those? You know... unless you really want to..."
Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,rainbow dash,[groans] Beat it! You go. I'll stay here.
Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,rarity,"Well, since we can't both get what we want, I will be the better friend. You take our trade goods and get what you want."
Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,applejack,"I'm an amazin' friend! So even though it's for somethin' that don't seem valuable at all, you take our stash."
Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,rarity,How dare you let me get what I want. What kind of friend do you think I am? You are going to get what you want!
Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,applejack,"No, you are!"
Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,rarity,"No, you are!"
Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,pinkie pie,"These books made Twilight the princess she is. Before that, she was nothing <U+0096> a big, fat zero!"
Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,twilight sparkle,Hey!
Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,pinkie pie,"Then she read these books, and voila! Princess! So who wants to start the bidding?"
Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,twilight sparkle,"Uh, just a moment, please! Pinkie, I appreciate your help and all, but I'm not sure I'm comfortable with this. Nopony should trade for my books just because I'm a princess. I'm not better than anypony else!"
Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,pinkie pie,"[hushed] I know you're not better than everypony! Just leave this to me! [to crowd, normal] Did I mention that Princess Twilight got these books from Princess Celestia?"
Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,pinkie pie,"Oh, that's right! Double princess!"
Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,fluttershy,There he is!
Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,rainbow dash,"Look, I know it's your break and all, but you've gotta open your stand so we can trade you for a lamp!"
Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,rainbow dash,"Oh come on, please?"
Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,fluttershy,Pretty pretty please?
Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,rainbow dash,But the Exchange ends at sundown!
Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,rainbow dash,I've got an idea. Next! Next! Next! Next! Next!
Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,rainbow dash,We're home free!
Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,rainbow dash,As long as this thing doesn't drown us in slobber.
Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,fluttershy,"Oh, he's just an affectionate little two-headed fellow. Aren't you, little boy?"
Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,applejack,"No, I insist. You go fetch what you want, 'cause that's the kind of tried and true friend I am."
Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,rarity,Well! I am way too generous to let you out-friend me like that!
Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,rainbow dash,We gotta hurry! [gasps] We're never gonna get to the Daring Do stand through this crowd in time!
Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,rainbow dash,Come on!
Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,fluttershy,My bear call!
Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,rainbow dash,We gotta go!
Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,fluttershy,Of course. It's just a bear call. There's nothing I could have traded it for that's more valuable to me than you.
Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,rainbow dash,"[sighs] Okay, the Exchange is almost over, but we did it. We traded a crystal chalice for an antique chicken..."
Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,fluttershy,And the chicken for a lamp...
Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,rainbow dash,"And the lamp for an Orthros, just like you asked."
Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,rainbow dash,So there you go! Now where's my book?
Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,fluttershy,But... what do we do now?
Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,fluttershy,"Oh goodness, oh goodness!"
Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,rainbow dash,Argh! Ugh...
Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,fluttershy,Good boy!
Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,rainbow dash,Hey! You said you wanted an Orthros!
Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,fluttershy,"There, there, that's a good Orthros. You just have to know how to train them. With a little patient training and a big slobber mop, they can be a wonderful household pet."
Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,rainbow dash,Yes!
Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,fluttershy,"Gosh, training an Orthros takes a long time. I'll probably be gone from Ponyville for... I don't even know how many moons! But... if that is what you really want..."
Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,rainbow dash,"Of course it's a deal! Yeah-eah, whoo! [squeals] I did it, I did it! Fluttershy, can you believe it? Oh no. what did I do?!"
Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,pinkie pie,"Who's got something valuable enough to trade for Princess Twilight's princess books that she got from Princess Celestia? Did I say ""princess""?"
Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,pinkie pie,"Oh, come on! These are the books the princess would sit up with all night, with nothing to read by but the light of her own horn! Ooh, now that looks fun<U+0096> but not fun enough! These are the books that made Twilight the princess she is! So who's got what it takes to trade for them?"
Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,twilight sparkle,"Oh, yes, they are."
Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,pinkie pie,But I thought you wanted to get rid of them!
Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,twilight sparkle,"None of those ponies had anything valuable enough to trade for my books. Not because these books belong to a princess, but because they helped make me who I am. Just like you said. This was the one I was so absorbed in the day Spike decided he owed Applejack a life debt. And this one reminds me of the day I got it <U+0096> which was the day I met you. I may not ever need to read these again, but that doesn't mean they don't have value. I realize that now, thanks to you, Pinkie."
Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,pinkie pie,I told you I'd take care of everything!
Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,rainbow dash,Twilight! I need you to say a trade wasn't fair! Fast!
Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,twilight sparkle,"I've heard what you both have to say, and I'm sorry, Rainbow Dash, but my hooves are tied. You said it was a fair trade."
Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,rainbow dash,"Yeah, I said it, but I was wrong! I did want that book, a lot. I said I wanted it more than anything in all of Equestria. But there's no thing that's worth as much to me as a friend. I might have forgotten that for a little bit, but it's true. Which means there's no way this trade can be fair!"
Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,pinkie pie,[in distance] Woo-hoo!
Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,rarity,"I know it's not the pie tin you were after, but I hope you like it. It's the rustiest piece of junk I could get."
Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,applejack,"Well, I took my half of our stash and got you this!"
Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,rarity,Ohhh!
Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,applejack,"And I know you're gonna love it, 'cause you already have a bunch of ones that look exactly the same sittin' in the drawer doin' nothin'. So that should settle it once and for all which of us is the better friend."
Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,rainbow dash,"Oh, come on! You both gave up what you wanted to get something for each other! That's the coolest thing a friend can do. Trust me, I know."
Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,pinkie pie,"Hey, where's your double-doggie?"
Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,rainbow dash,I traded it for something way better.
Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,twilight sparkle,"Well, what do you know? My copy of Daring Do and the Sapphire Statue. It's just a beat up old paperback, not a one-of-a-kind first edition..."
Trade Ya!,Scott Sonneborn,rainbow dash,"[gasps] Even better, because I can read this one with all my friends!"
Inspiration Manifestation,Corey Powell & Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,"Hear ye, hear ye! The Ponyville Foal and Filly Fair is almost ready to begin!"
Inspiration Manifestation,Corey Powell & Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"Just because the attendees are young, doesn't mean they don't deserve my very best creative work. Why, this puppet theater is going to be the talk of the Foal and Filly Fair!"
Inspiration Manifestation,Corey Powell & Meghan McCarthy,spike,How could it not be? [dreamily] You're the one making it...
Inspiration Manifestation,Corey Powell & Meghan McCarthy,rarity,Oh! But I couldn't have done it without the help of one of my dearest and most supportive friends! You are my favorite dragon.
Inspiration Manifestation,Corey Powell & Meghan McCarthy,spike,"Your favorite dragon? Aw, gee..."
Inspiration Manifestation,Corey Powell & Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"The hours have been long, the work taxing beyond compare, but it will all be worth it when we hear those three little words!"
Inspiration Manifestation,Corey Powell & Meghan McCarthy,rarity,Awful?!
Inspiration Manifestation,Corey Powell & Meghan McCarthy,spike,I don't know what that guy was talking about. This thing is perfect!
Inspiration Manifestation,Corey Powell & Meghan McCarthy,spike,So that puppeteer didn't like your exquisitely crafted best puppet theater in the history of puppet theaters puppet theater. [beat] You can just contribute something else to the Foal and Filly Fair.
Inspiration Manifestation,Corey Powell & Meghan McCarthy,spike,"Argh, there's gotta be something in here somewhere."
Inspiration Manifestation,Corey Powell & Meghan McCarthy,spike,"It's not ""who"", it's ""what""! Like, what can help Rarity make something in time for the fair? She really, really, really wants to make a creative contribution. She said I'm her favorite dragon, so it's up to me to come through for her in her time of need. There's gotta be some kind of spell that'll do the trick."
Inspiration Manifestation,Corey Powell & Meghan McCarthy,spike,"Come on, help a dragon out!"
Inspiration Manifestation,Corey Powell & Meghan McCarthy,spike,Ugh! It's not for me! It's for Rarity! The one who made you that bow tie you like so much?
Inspiration Manifestation,Corey Powell & Meghan McCarthy,spike,"Okay, I get it."
Inspiration Manifestation,Corey Powell & Meghan McCarthy,spike,You don't think we should use magic<U+0096> What is that?
Inspiration Manifestation,Corey Powell & Meghan McCarthy,spike,"What? If I wasn't supposed to have it, it wouldn't be so easy to get. And it's covered in spikes, like me."
Inspiration Manifestation,Corey Powell & Meghan McCarthy,spike,"""Inspiration Manifestation: Instantly brings ideas to life."""
Inspiration Manifestation,Corey Powell & Meghan McCarthy,spike,I'm likin' the looks of this one. Hmmm.
Inspiration Manifestation,Corey Powell & Meghan McCarthy,spike,Rarity!
Inspiration Manifestation,Corey Powell & Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"Leave me be! Can't you see how distraught, disappointed, and downtrodden I still am?"
Inspiration Manifestation,Corey Powell & Meghan McCarthy,spike,But I brought you something.
Inspiration Manifestation,Corey Powell & Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"Unless it's another carton of vanilla oat swirl or word that the festival has been cancelled, I don't think I'm interested."
Inspiration Manifestation,Corey Powell & Meghan McCarthy,spike,It's magic!
Inspiration Manifestation,Corey Powell & Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"Spike, precious scales, I already have magic."
Inspiration Manifestation,Corey Powell & Meghan McCarthy,spike,But not the kind that can help you create something in time for the fair. This can!
Inspiration Manifestation,Corey Powell & Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"I suppose it's worth a try. ""From in the head to out in the world, every thought to action. Hold close this book and through its spell, you'll start a chain reaction. Projecting forth whatever beauty you see. Only when true words are spoken will you finally be set free."""
Inspiration Manifestation,Corey Powell & Meghan McCarthy,spike,Did it work?
Inspiration Manifestation,Corey Powell & Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"Hm, there's only one way to find out."
Inspiration Manifestation,Corey Powell & Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"[gasps] Oh, my! I thought about making this a much more beautiful spell book, and I have!"
Inspiration Manifestation,Corey Powell & Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"Dear, dear Spike! Here I was about to give up, but like a true friend, you've come through with flying colors! Come! We must find the puppeteer right away, so that I may provide him with the most fabulous theater he's ever imagined! Or, should I say, that I've ever imagined."
Inspiration Manifestation,Corey Powell & Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"Oh, but I think you'll find the new one I've created will be much more to your liking!"
Inspiration Manifestation,Corey Powell & Meghan McCarthy,spike,"As a matter of fact, she used a s<U+0096>"
Inspiration Manifestation,Corey Powell & Meghan McCarthy,rarity,A good designer never reveals her tricks.
Inspiration Manifestation,Corey Powell & Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"Thank you again, Spike, for being such a dear friend and finding this book for me!"
Inspiration Manifestation,Corey Powell & Meghan McCarthy,spike,"My pleasure. Well, guess I can return it now that the fair's over."
Inspiration Manifestation,Corey Powell & Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"Oh, yes, of course. I've made my creative contribution as I'd hoped to do, and all is well! Uh, then again, perhaps I should keep it just a skotch longer... You don't mind, do you, Spike?"
Inspiration Manifestation,Corey Powell & Meghan McCarthy,spike,"Of course not! See you tomorrow! [to Owlowiscious] What? She'll keep it for a few more hours, no harm in that."
Inspiration Manifestation,Corey Powell & Meghan McCarthy,spike,Rarity?
Inspiration Manifestation,Corey Powell & Meghan McCarthy,spike,Whoa!
Inspiration Manifestation,Corey Powell & Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"Spike, I'm so glad you're here!"
Inspiration Manifestation,Corey Powell & Meghan McCarthy,spike,Whoa! Are... you okay?
Inspiration Manifestation,Corey Powell & Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"Oh, I've never been better! This book you've given me is amazing! Why, I, I, I, I've been up all night just creating and creating and creating and creating! I've completed my fall line for the next fifteen seasons!"
Inspiration Manifestation,Corey Powell & Meghan McCarthy,spike,Wow!
Inspiration Manifestation,Corey Powell & Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"But then I started thinking, 'why stop there'? Oh, Spike, I've always thought this town of ours could use a few beautifying upgrades, and with this book, I can make that happen with such ease! You will support me in this endeavor by letting me keep the book just a little longer?"
Inspiration Manifestation,Corey Powell & Meghan McCarthy,spike,Of course I will!
Inspiration Manifestation,Corey Powell & Meghan McCarthy,spike,[panting] What do you say we get a little breakfast before we get started?
Inspiration Manifestation,Corey Powell & Meghan McCarthy,rarity,No time for breakfast! I want to get started right away!
Inspiration Manifestation,Corey Powell & Meghan McCarthy,spike,"Technically, we do have time, because with that book held close, you can just make things<U+0096> Rarity?"
Inspiration Manifestation,Corey Powell & Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"Now, this is exactly what I'm talking about! Why, that cart hasn't an ounce of stylish flair!"
Inspiration Manifestation,Corey Powell & Meghan McCarthy,granny smith,My eyes playin' tricks on me again?
Inspiration Manifestation,Corey Powell & Meghan McCarthy,applejack,What in rhubarb pie just happened?
Inspiration Manifestation,Corey Powell & Meghan McCarthy,rarity,Isn't it gorgeous?
Inspiration Manifestation,Corey Powell & Meghan McCarthy,spike,It's amazing! You should ask Applejack if she wants you to give all the Apple family carts a makeover!
Inspiration Manifestation,Corey Powell & Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"Oh, I don't really think I need to ask permission, darling. Everyone loves surprises, especially when they're gorgeous ones!"
Inspiration Manifestation,Corey Powell & Meghan McCarthy,spike,You're right! Everypony does love surprises.
Inspiration Manifestation,Corey Powell & Meghan McCarthy,rarity,[hushed] We shouldn't even tell anypony that it's me who's behind all the fabulous changes I'll be making! [giggles] Won't that be a fun little secret for the three of us to share?
Inspiration Manifestation,Corey Powell & Meghan McCarthy,spike,The... three of us?
Inspiration Manifestation,Corey Powell & Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"You, me, and the book, of course. My marvelous, marvelous book!"
Inspiration Manifestation,Corey Powell & Meghan McCarthy,spike,...Of course.
Inspiration Manifestation,Corey Powell & Meghan McCarthy,rarity,Promise me you won't say a word to anypony?
Inspiration Manifestation,Corey Powell & Meghan McCarthy,spike,[muffled] You got it!
Inspiration Manifestation,Corey Powell & Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"I knew I could count on you, Spike. And I also know just what I want to do next!"
Inspiration Manifestation,Corey Powell & Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"I've always thought Rainbow Dash could use a little more glamor, and now look at her! Cloud-busting with style! [short laugh] Moving on!"
Inspiration Manifestation,Corey Powell & Meghan McCarthy,spike,"She'll be fine. It's just a dress. Uh, wait for your favorite dragon!"
Inspiration Manifestation,Corey Powell & Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,"La la-la la-la la-la la la... There you go, Mr. Robin!"
Inspiration Manifestation,Corey Powell & Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,Don't you look so content in your little house<U+0096>
Inspiration Manifestation,Corey Powell & Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,"[gasps] Oh, my goodness!"
Inspiration Manifestation,Corey Powell & Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,"You're lost? No, not that way, that looks like it's the door to a... bedroom. Try that one over there. No, no, that leads to a..."
Inspiration Manifestation,Corey Powell & Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,"Shoe closet? Oh, dear. Maybe try the staircase? Oh, no-no-no, the other staircase."
Inspiration Manifestation,Corey Powell & Meghan McCarthy,rarity,Isn't it gorgeous?
Inspiration Manifestation,Corey Powell & Meghan McCarthy,spike,It's probably the most beautiful birdhouse ever created.
Inspiration Manifestation,Corey Powell & Meghan McCarthy,rarity,Go on.
Inspiration Manifestation,Corey Powell & Meghan McCarthy,spike,I'm just not sure how the bird feels about it.
Inspiration Manifestation,Corey Powell & Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"Pfft, what does a bird know about architectural design? What matters is what you think, Spike. And you love it. Don't you?"
Inspiration Manifestation,Corey Powell & Meghan McCarthy,spike,Of course I do. It's so... [beat] Rarity.
Inspiration Manifestation,Corey Powell & Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"It is, isn't it? Ooh!"
Inspiration Manifestation,Corey Powell & Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"Oh, adorable! But it could use a touch of class, don't you think?"
Inspiration Manifestation,Corey Powell & Meghan McCarthy,spike,"Oh yeah, definitely."
Inspiration Manifestation,Corey Powell & Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"This party doesn't even seem to have a proper theme. Let's do something about that, shall we?"
Inspiration Manifestation,Corey Powell & Meghan McCarthy,spike,You've already made things look really really great. Maybe you should stop while you're ahead?
Inspiration Manifestation,Corey Powell & Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"You're right, Spike! There's so much to do elsewhere!"
Inspiration Manifestation,Corey Powell & Meghan McCarthy,spike,Right! Elsewhere...
Inspiration Manifestation,Corey Powell & Meghan McCarthy,rarity,Just one more little thing before we go...
Inspiration Manifestation,Corey Powell & Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"Why, this party is certain to make the society page now. Won't Pinkie Pie be pleased?"
Inspiration Manifestation,Corey Powell & Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,"Happy, happy day to<U+0096> huh?!"
Inspiration Manifestation,Corey Powell & Meghan McCarthy,rarity,I am simply buzzing with ideas. Simply buzzing!
Inspiration Manifestation,Corey Powell & Meghan McCarthy,spike,"That's great! But, uh, you've been at this for a while now. How 'bout you take a break? Give that brilliant mind of yours a rest?"
Inspiration Manifestation,Corey Powell & Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"Don't be silly! I'm not going to stop now! Why, I won't stop until every inch of Ponyville has benefited from my creative vision! Starting with you, Spike!"
Inspiration Manifestation,Corey Powell & Meghan McCarthy,rarity,You look fabulous!
Inspiration Manifestation,Corey Powell & Meghan McCarthy,spike,"All because of you, heh..."
Inspiration Manifestation,Corey Powell & Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"Anything for my favorite dragon and most supportive friend. Come, there's so much more to do!"
Inspiration Manifestation,Corey Powell & Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"[gasps] Oh no, not you too!"
Inspiration Manifestation,Corey Powell & Meghan McCarthy,spike,"What do you mean, not me too?"
Inspiration Manifestation,Corey Powell & Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"Oh. Judging by that outfit, I thought for sure you'd<U+0096>"
Inspiration Manifestation,Corey Powell & Meghan McCarthy,spike,What? This? I just wanted to try out a new look.
Inspiration Manifestation,Corey Powell & Meghan McCarthy,spike,You like?
Inspiration Manifestation,Corey Powell & Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"Hmm... Well, in that case, have you seen anypony suspicious around?"
Inspiration Manifestation,Corey Powell & Meghan McCarthy,spike,"Uh, nope."
Inspiration Manifestation,Corey Powell & Meghan McCarthy,mayor mare,"Princess Twilight, the gazebo has been turned into solid crystal, and two ponies are now trapped inside its walls!"
Inspiration Manifestation,Corey Powell & Meghan McCarthy,spike,No! I made a promise to Rarity to keep this to myself!
Inspiration Manifestation,Corey Powell & Meghan McCarthy,spike,"[sighs] But you're right, Owlowiscious. I have to tell. And once I do, I can forget Rarity thinking of me as her most supportive friend... I can forget Rarity thinking of me as a friend at all..."
Inspiration Manifestation,Corey Powell & Meghan McCarthy,spike,[sighs] I can't do it. I promised I'd keep all of this between the three of us!
Inspiration Manifestation,Corey Powell & Meghan McCarthy,spike,"Of course it's weird she meant her, me and the spell book. But<U+0096> The spellbook! Of course! If I can get it away from her, I bet she won't be able to use its magic anymore! Oh, come on, it's the perfect plan! I... just have to figure out which way she went."
Inspiration Manifestation,Corey Powell & Meghan McCarthy,spike,I'm thinking she's headed this way.
Inspiration Manifestation,Corey Powell & Meghan McCarthy,rarity,[giggling] What do you think you're doing?!
Inspiration Manifestation,Corey Powell & Meghan McCarthy,spike,"Uh, me? I was just, uh... basking in your creative radiance."
Inspiration Manifestation,Corey Powell & Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"Oh, Spike, you do say the nicest things."
Inspiration Manifestation,Corey Powell & Meghan McCarthy,spike,Thanks.
Inspiration Manifestation,Corey Powell & Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"Now, where was I? Oh yes! Gold-plated rooftops for everypony!"
Inspiration Manifestation,Corey Powell & Meghan McCarthy,rarity,Spike!
Inspiration Manifestation,Corey Powell & Meghan McCarthy,rarity,I have just had the most marvelous idea!
Inspiration Manifestation,Corey Powell & Meghan McCarthy,spike,[gulps] [gasps] Of course you have. You're Rarity.
Inspiration Manifestation,Corey Powell & Meghan McCarthy,rarity,My work here in Ponyville is nearly complete. Don't you think it's time the rest of Equestria benefited from my creative vision?
Inspiration Manifestation,Corey Powell & Meghan McCarthy,spike,Absolutely!
Inspiration Manifestation,Corey Powell & Meghan McCarthy,spike,"Oh, yeah, we should definitely go by<U+0096>"
Inspiration Manifestation,Corey Powell & Meghan McCarthy,spike,Huh?! How... how did you... do that?
Inspiration Manifestation,Corey Powell & Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"Why, whatever do you mean?"
Inspiration Manifestation,Corey Powell & Meghan McCarthy,spike,The book! It's<U+0096> I mean<U+0096> you don't<U+0096> it's gone! The book is gone!
Inspiration Manifestation,Corey Powell & Meghan McCarthy,spike,Why would I do anything with your book? We're friends! It... it was probably the owl!
Inspiration Manifestation,Corey Powell & Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"But, wait... I don't seem to need it anymore, do I? Yes... yes...! I can feel its magic flowing within me now! I'm so excited! I'm so excited!"
Inspiration Manifestation,Corey Powell & Meghan McCarthy,spike,[quietly] I'm so scared.
Inspiration Manifestation,Corey Powell & Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"Oh, the places we'll go, Spike! Manehattan, Fillydelphia, Canterlot! And there you'll be by my side, just as you've always been here in Ponyville, your constant praise and adoration driving me to even greater heights, until there isn't an inch of Equestria that hasn't been utterly transformed by my creative genius!"
Inspiration Manifestation,Corey Powell & Meghan McCarthy,spike,...No.
Inspiration Manifestation,Corey Powell & Meghan McCarthy,rarity,What did you say?
Inspiration Manifestation,Corey Powell & Meghan McCarthy,spike,"I said 'no'. You've been changing things, but you haven't been making them better. I should have told you the truth at the very beginning, but I didn't because I was trying to be a supportive friend. [sighs] But instead, I let you become something awful."
Inspiration Manifestation,Corey Powell & Meghan McCarthy,rarity,Awful?
Inspiration Manifestation,Corey Powell & Meghan McCarthy,rarity,Ugh... what happened?
Inspiration Manifestation,Corey Powell & Meghan McCarthy,spike,Rarity! You're okay?
Inspiration Manifestation,Corey Powell & Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"I... I think so... though by the looks of it, something quite terrifying has happened to Ponyville."
Inspiration Manifestation,Corey Powell & Meghan McCarthy,spike,You happened.
Inspiration Manifestation,Corey Powell & Meghan McCarthy,rarity,Me?
Inspiration Manifestation,Corey Powell & Meghan McCarthy,spike,The last part of the spell!
Inspiration Manifestation,Corey Powell & Meghan McCarthy,rarity,[flashback] Only when true words are spoken will you finally be set free.
Inspiration Manifestation,Corey Powell & Meghan McCarthy,spike,"The spell took over you, and you wanted to change everything in Equestria. I was afraid to tell you how I really felt about it, but then I... I told you the truth."
Inspiration Manifestation,Corey Powell & Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"Dearest Spike, you should never be afraid to tell me the truth. We're friends, remember?"
Inspiration Manifestation,Corey Powell & Meghan McCarthy,spike,Today I learned how important it is to be honest with your friends when they're doing something that you don't think is right. A true friend knows that you're speaking up because you care about them.
Inspiration Manifestation,Corey Powell & Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"Spike. Never, ever, ever, ever take another book out of the library at the castle without asking! Princess Cadance and Princess Luna have much better things to do than help me clean up Ponyville! Do you have any idea how hard it was to reverse that much dark magic?!"
Inspiration Manifestation,Corey Powell & Meghan McCarthy,spike,[chuckles] You don't look so good.
Inspiration Manifestation,Corey Powell & Meghan McCarthy,spike,What? I'm just being honest! It's what good friends do!
Equestria Games,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,This just got real!
Equestria Games,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,"Listen up, gang! We're almost there, so I've got a few things to say. First off, who here besides me thinks this is the best Equestria Games delegation in Ponyville history?"
Equestria Games,Dave Polsky,bulk biceps,Yeah!
Equestria Games,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,"And no matter what your sport is, we gotta give it our best, because we've all got a genuine shot at Ponyville gold!"
Equestria Games,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,"...With the possible exception of Bulk Biceps, Fluttershy, and me. I mean, we're good and all, but we're up against the Wonderbolts in the aerial relay, so gold's kind of a stretch. Let's not kid ourselves."
Equestria Games,Dave Polsky,scootaloo,"Don't feel bad, Rainbow Dash! We have absolutely no shot at getting gold either!"
Equestria Games,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,"Uh, that's because you're carrying the flag for Ponyville in the opening ceremony. There are no winners."
Equestria Games,Dave Polsky,scootaloo,"Winners or not, we still have the chance to be awesome!"
Equestria Games,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,"That's the spirit! You hear that, everypony? Winners or not, we all still have the chance to be awesome!"
Equestria Games,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,"But, uh, let's still try to win lots and lots of stuff too, 'kay?"
Equestria Games,Dave Polsky,spike,"[straining] It's all in there, gang! Leave it to Spike, champion gear-carrier for all your gear-carrying needs."
Equestria Games,Dave Polsky,apple bloom,And the Ponyville flag? You sure? And what about the flagpole?
Equestria Games,Dave Polsky,spike,In with the portable ramp! Whoa!
Equestria Games,Dave Polsky,scootaloo,"Give it a rest, Apple Bloom."
Equestria Games,Dave Polsky,spike,"Aw, she's just nervous, that's all. Perfectly understandable. Whenever I'm afraid I'll forget something or start to panic, I have a simple trick. I count to ten, and by the time I'm done, I've calmed myself enough to get the job done right every time. Easy-peasy, cider-squeezy!"
Equestria Games,Dave Polsky,spike,Hey! Put me down!
Equestria Games,Dave Polsky,scootaloo,What's going on?!
Equestria Games,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,Spike! Are you all right?
Equestria Games,Dave Polsky,spike,Huh? Who the what now?
Equestria Games,Dave Polsky,princess cadance,"[to guards] Thanks for bringing Spike to us. [to Spike] It's okay, Spike. We'll have our hoofponies go back for your bags."
Equestria Games,Dave Polsky,spike,"Uh, can they hang back a second and tell me what's going on first?"
Equestria Games,Dave Polsky,spike,"[eating] Mm! So the ponies here think I'm some kind of hero, huh? [to Fleur De Verre] More of the green ones, please? I like the green ones."
Equestria Games,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"Last time you were here, you got the Crystal Heart to Princess Cadance in time to save this entire empire from destruction!"
Equestria Games,Dave Polsky,princess cadance,"You are known throughout my empire as ""Great and Honorable Spike the Brave and Glorious""."
Equestria Games,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"Isn't that awesome? You're a big shot here, Spike! See that? That's you!"
Equestria Games,Dave Polsky,spike,"[a la Barbra Streisand] Hello, gawgeous!"
Equestria Games,Dave Polsky,princess cadance,This is why we all hope you do us the honor of lighting the torch at the opening ceremony. You'd be the very first dragon in the history of the Equestria Games to do so.
Equestria Games,Dave Polsky,shining armor,"Places for the procession, everypony! Two minutes!"
Equestria Games,Dave Polsky,spike,"I stand where you tell me until you give me the signal, and then I walk over and light the torch."
Equestria Games,Dave Polsky,shining armor,"Now, please welcome the delegation from Ponyville!"
Equestria Games,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,Awesome!
Equestria Games,Dave Polsky,fluttershy,Yay.
Equestria Games,Dave Polsky,bulk biceps,Yeah!
Equestria Games,Dave Polsky,spike,"[inhales] [coughing] Come on, Spike! Calm yourself! Count to ten. One... two... three... thousand... fourteen thousand... Twenty thousand...! Thirty thousand...!"
Equestria Games,Dave Polsky,princess cadance,What's wrong?
Equestria Games,Dave Polsky,spike,[inhales] [weak breath] Tell me this isn't happening...
Equestria Games,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"Equestria, we have a problem."
Equestria Games,Dave Polsky,spike,"I don't know what it is, but I just don't have the stuff today! Did you bring a match?"
Equestria Games,Dave Polsky,spike,"[coughs] [raspy] Then some cough drops, maybe?"
Equestria Games,Dave Polsky,princess cadance,Somepony go down and help him!
Equestria Games,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,Phew!
Equestria Games,Dave Polsky,spike,I'm... not sure.
Equestria Games,Dave Polsky,shining armor,Let the games begin!
Equestria Games,Dave Polsky,rarity,Oh! There are our little superstars! You were fabulous!
Equestria Games,Dave Polsky,applejack,Made me sit up proud like a cornstalk in August!
Equestria Games,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,"Ya done good, squirt!"
Equestria Games,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,You three really were wonderful. But does anypony know what was going on with Spike?
Equestria Games,Dave Polsky,applejack,He sure seemed to be having a tough time of it out there.
Equestria Games,Dave Polsky,rarity,"He put things right in time, though."
Equestria Games,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"Actually, it was me. I didn't want him to be embarrassed, so I cast a secret spell to light it for him."
Equestria Games,Dave Polsky,rarity,"Oh, dear. Have you told him?"
Equestria Games,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"No, but he might have figured it out on his own."
Equestria Games,Dave Polsky,applejack,"You gotta tell him, just in case."
Equestria Games,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,I know. I'm just afraid of how he'll take it. I know what pride he takes in a job well done.
Equestria Games,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,"Psst, here he comes now! Act casual! [to Spike] 'Sup?"
Equestria Games,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,Spike! Is everything okay?
Equestria Games,Dave Polsky,spike,I guess. I don't know. The weirdest thing happened down there.
Equestria Games,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"Yeah, about that. I<U+0096>"
Equestria Games,Dave Polsky,spike,"I mean, there I was, trying to light the torch, with all of Equestria watching, and feeling like the hugest failure ever, and then the thing just lit! It was amazing!"
Equestria Games,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"Oh, phew! I was afraid you'd be upset."
Equestria Games,Dave Polsky,spike,Upset? Are you kidding? Why would I be upset to discover I can light fire... with my mind?
Equestria Games,Dave Polsky,spike,Sure!
Equestria Games,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"[whispering] Spike, may I have a word with you a moment?"
Equestria Games,Dave Polsky,spike,"Hey, you'd better be careful with that! It might burst into flames later! Delayed reaction. Hey, Twi, what is it? Hold on, hold on, give me a second... If I can set fire to stuff with my mind, mind-reading must be just around the corner! And I predict that you are about to ask me... to set fire to something with my mind!"
Equestria Games,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"No, because you can't!"
Equestria Games,Dave Polsky,spike,"Oh, really? So how do you explain what happened down there in front of thousands and thousands of<U+0096>"
Equestria Games,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"I did it, Spike. I cast a spell to do it for you."
Equestria Games,Dave Polsky,spike,In front of... thousands and... thousands...?
Equestria Games,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"I'm sorry, Spike. I just couldn't stand to see you stuck like that! You understand, don't you?"
Equestria Games,Dave Polsky,spike,I... I... I need to be alone right now.
Equestria Games,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,Spike?
Equestria Games,Dave Polsky,spike,Sorry. You should probably ask somebody special instead.
Equestria Games,Dave Polsky,shining armor,"Our next event... [amplified, some distance away] ...the aerial relay!"
Equestria Games,Dave Polsky,applejack,That's Dash and Fluttershy!
Equestria Games,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,"Oh, no! We can't be late for that!"
Equestria Games,Dave Polsky,rarity,Hmph!
Equestria Games,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,"[chewing] [swallows] If Ponyville medals here, we'll have eight medals so far, putting us tied for the lead with Cloudsdale! Unless Cloudsdale medals here too...!"
Equestria Games,Dave Polsky,spike,"Ms. Harshwhinny? I know you're really busy, but..."
Equestria Games,Dave Polsky,spike,"Maybe there's something else I can do for the Games. Y'know, something really worthy of the Crystal Empire's admiration?"
Equestria Games,Dave Polsky,spike,"Uh, well, actually, that wasn't really<U+0096>"
Equestria Games,Dave Polsky,spike,"Wait, that's it!"
Equestria Games,Dave Polsky,applejack,We got silver!
Equestria Games,Dave Polsky,shining armor,"Congratulations to all our medalists. And now, the anthem of<U+0096>"
Equestria Games,Dave Polsky,spike,And I shall do the honor of singing!
Equestria Games,Dave Polsky,shining armor,"[to Spike, hushed] Spike, what are you doing?!"
Equestria Games,Dave Polsky,spike,"You know how they always just play the music? [amplified] Well, I know all the words to our anthem, and will sing them for you now, loud and proud, to the enjoyment of all!"
Equestria Games,Dave Polsky,shining armor,"And now... um... the Cloudsdale anthem, as sung by... Spike!"
Equestria Games,Dave Polsky,spike,Wait! The Cloudsdale anthem?
Equestria Games,Dave Polsky,shining armor,"[hushed] They only play the anthem for the winner, Spike! The Wonderbolts are from Cloudsdale!"
Equestria Games,Dave Polsky,spike,But... But I don't know the words to the Cloudsdale anthem! I've never even heard it!
Equestria Games,Dave Polsky,spike,"[clears throat] [singing out of time and rhythm] Oh, we're the Wonderbolts and we're super fast And we're from Cloudsdale which-is-a-part-of-Equestria<U+00A0> [laughs nervously] That we like best and we're proud and we're fast and we like it because it really has nice trees Yeah, we love the town because it's so cool and, and we like to fly really fast and everything like that [sighs] I kinda wish this was over 'cause it is... n't... yet... over... now."
Equestria Games,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,Nailed it!
Equestria Games,Dave Polsky,apple bloom,"Spike, you comin'?"
Equestria Games,Dave Polsky,spike,"Nah, I got this stuff to pack up."
Equestria Games,Dave Polsky,scootaloo,But you've been moping in here for almost the entire Games.
Equestria Games,Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,And tonight's the closing ceremony!
Equestria Games,Dave Polsky,spike,"Which means we leave tomorrow. Ergo, the packing."
Equestria Games,Dave Polsky,shining armor,"And so the Games conclude as they always do, with the ice archery finals! Ice archers, take your places!"
Equestria Games,Dave Polsky,applejack,Too bad Ponyville doesn't have any ice archers competin'. We don't have anyone to root for.
Equestria Games,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,"That's okay. Ponyville has thirty seven medals, and Cloudsdale thirty six, so looks like we'll be medal champs of the Games anyway! Woo-hoo!"
Equestria Games,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,"But Cloudsdale has two ice archery finalists down there now! If they both place, Cloudsale wins the medal count!"
Equestria Games,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,So you're saying that it all comes down to this one event?!
Equestria Games,Dave Polsky,applejack,Pretty much.
Equestria Games,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,Omigoshomigoshomigoshomigosh! Twilight! Come take this extra seat next to me and freak out over the medal count! I'll show you how: Omigoshomigoshomigoshomigosh!
Equestria Games,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"Actually, I was looking for Spike. Have you seen him?"
Equestria Games,Dave Polsky,apple bloom,He wouldn't come.
Equestria Games,Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,We tried to talk him into it...
Equestria Games,Dave Polsky,scootaloo,...but he wouldn't listen!
Equestria Games,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,"You can have his extra seat, though. Uh... Twi?"
Equestria Games,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,Spike?
Equestria Games,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,You here?
Equestria Games,Dave Polsky,spike,"[chokes] Uh, yeah! I'm super-busy! Look at all this packing left to do, heh. Crazy, right?"
Equestria Games,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,No more hiding out. You're coming with me. Now.
Equestria Games,Dave Polsky,spike,"Okay, fine. I'll come. Can I at least wear these?"
Equestria Games,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,Those aren't your average arrows. They freeze whatever part of the target they hit. Whoever encases their entire target in ice first wins. Keep your eye on number seven from Cloudsdale <U+0096> he's the favorite.
Equestria Games,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"Honestly, Spike, I don't see why you're being so hard on yourself."
Equestria Games,Dave Polsky,spike,"I let everypony down. Twice. You never let anypony down, so you don't have any idea what that's like."
Equestria Games,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"Are you kidding? I've totally let ponies down. That's not the point. The torch got lit, the aerial relay teams got their medals -- no harm, no foul."
Equestria Games,Dave Polsky,spike,Can we at least watch from inside there? I'm not sure I'm ready to face crowds in the stands just yet.
Equestria Games,Dave Polsky,shining armor,No!
Equestria Games,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,"Steer it towards the field, away from the crowds!"
Equestria Games,Dave Polsky,shining armor,Somepony cut the disabling spell!
Equestria Games,Dave Polsky,spike,"Dash, Fluttershy! Move!"
Equestria Games,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,That was awesome!
Equestria Games,Dave Polsky,princess cadance,"I just wanted to thank you personally for saving those ponies and the Games, O Great and Honorable Spike the Brave and Glorious. You must be very proud."
Equestria Games,Dave Polsky,spike,I guess.
Equestria Games,Dave Polsky,spike,"I just saw what needed to be done and reacted. Just so happens I can breathe fire and... if any of you could do that, you'd have done the same."
Equestria Games,Dave Polsky,applejack,"Forgive me for bein' blunt, Spike, but you're not makin' a lick of sense."
Equestria Games,Dave Polsky,spike,"Well, it's just how I feel."
Equestria Games,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"Wait a second. I think I get it. You keep saying you let everypony down, but we all keep saying you didn't. You know who's disappointed in you, Spike? You. And only you can make it right with you again. What would that take, Spike?"
Equestria Games,Dave Polsky,spike,"Meh, I don't know. Can you turn back time? 'Cause I'd sure like a do-over on that opening ceremony."
Equestria Games,Dave Polsky,princess cadance,"We can't turn back time, but, would you do me the great honor of lighting fireworks in my place at the closing ceremonies tonight?"
Equestria Games,Dave Polsky,twilight sparkle,"Come on, Spike. You saved the Crystal Empire twice! I think you can light some fireworks."
Equestria Games,Dave Polsky,spike,"Mm, I guess I have to at least give it a shot."
Equestria Games,Dave Polsky,pinkie pie,"We did it! Ponyville won the medal count, and only by one medal!"
Equestria Games,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,"Hmm, wonder which medal that was? Bam!"
Equestria Games,Dave Polsky,applejack,"How does it feel to have opened the best Equestria Games in Ponyville history, squirt?"
Equestria Games,Dave Polsky,apple bloom,Probably as good as it feels to close them!
Equestria Games,Dave Polsky,spike,"You know, it's kinda weird. No matter how many times others tell you you're great, all the praise in the world means nothing if you don't feel it inside. [inhales] [breathes fire] Sometimes to feel good about yourself, you gotta let go of the past. That way, when the time comes to let your greatness fly, you'll be able to light up the whole sky."
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,spike,"Seems like only yesterday I was saving this place from being totally destroyed. Hey, you guys remember that?"
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,You only mentioned it about fifteen times on the train here.
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"[sarcastically, to Rainbow Dash] Yes, and we never hear a peep out of you about your exploits."
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,"Heh, point taken."
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"I'm glad you all wanted to come, but I don't think it's gonna be that exciting. I pretty much just have to smile and wave as the dignitaries arrive."
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"Yes, but you get to smile and wave like a princess."
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,applejack,How exactly is that different than smilin' and wavin' like not a princess?
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,It isn't.
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,"What's wrong, Twilight?"
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,Why the looooooooong face?
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,I've just been feeling a little unsure about things lately. It doesn't seem that my new role as a princess equates to all that much.
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,applejack,That's just silly. You've got a real important role in Equestria.
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,Princess Celestia wouldn't have asked you to come today if she didn't think so.
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,I guess you're right.
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,Of course we are. Now hurry along! You don't want to risk having that important role diminished because you were tardy for your regal meet-and-greet.
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Of course.
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Is there anything else I can do to assist with their visit?
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,princess cadance,"I'm sorry, Twilight, but their visit is already over."
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Oh.
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,princess luna,Something wrong?
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,I guess I just don't really understand why I'm here. Couldn't one of the royal guard have unfurled the banner?
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,princess celestia,Having all four of us in the Empire to greet them lets the dignitaries know that their visit is considered an important one.
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,princess cadance,"Plus, it gives me an opportunity to see my favorite sister-in-law."
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,And I'm happy to see you. All of you.
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,princess cadance,But...?
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"But I... well, it's just that Princess Luna raises the moon, Princess Celestia raises the sun, you protect the Crystal Empire, and all I seem to do is... smile and wave."
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"It isn't that I'm ungrateful For all the things that I've earned, For all the journeys I have taken, All the lessons that I have learned"
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,princess celestia,Your destiny's uncertain And that's sometimes hard to take But it will become much clearer With every new choice you make
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,princess luna,Patience is never easy I understand wanting more I know how hard it is to wait To spread out your wings and soar
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,princess cadance,But you stand here for a reason You're gifted and you are strong That crown is upon your head because You belong
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,princess luna,"We understand you wanting more A chance to shine, a chance to soar"
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,princess cadance,Soon will come the day it turns around
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,princess celestia,You are a princess; you'll play your part
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,princess celestia,Your time will come.
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,princess luna,"Sister, are you alright?!"
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,princess celestia,I've just had the most terrible dream.
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,princess luna,"Why do you think I'm here? You know as well as I that this was not a dream, but a vision."
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,princess celestia,"Then we haven't much time. The stronger he becomes, the more we are all in danger."
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,princess celestia,"[narrating] Tirek and his brother Scorpan came here from a distant land, intent on stealing Equestrian magic. But Scorpan soon came to appreciate the ways of Equestria, even befriending a young unicorn wizard."
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,princess luna,"[narrating] Scorpan urged his brother to abandon their plans. When Tirek refused, Scorpan alerted us to Tirek's intentions."
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,princess celestia,"[narrating] Scorpan returned to his own land, and Tirek was sent to Tartarus for his crimes. But it appears he has found a way to escape."
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,princess luna,We believe it happened when Cerberus left his post at the gates.
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,But that was a long time ago. Why is he just now starting to steal magic?
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,princess celestia,His time in Tartarus left him very weak. He has just now gained enough strength to use his dark powers.
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,princess luna,"But with each passing moment, he grows stronger still."
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,princess cadance,And I know just the princess who can stop him.
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Yes. I'll find him and<U+0096>
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,princess celestia,"No, Twilight. I'm afraid I must call in another to stop Tirek. Discord."
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,applejack,...As in Discord Discord?
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Yes!
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,I don't think it's that big of a surprise. He can be very helpful.
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"He can sense when there's a magical imbalance. The next time Tirek steals magic, Discord will be able to track him down!"
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,So what are you supposed to do in the meantime?
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,[sighs] Nothing. Unless of course one of you needs me to smile and wave.
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,spike,Where are you going?
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,To the Castle of the Two Sisters. I'm not really needed anywhere else. Might as well catch up on some of my reading.
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,You want some company?
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,applejack,<U+00A0>It has been a while since we visited the castle. Might be fun!
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Maybe I could use a little company right now.
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,[sighs] I still can't believe we had to give back the Elements.
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,It had to be done or the Tree of Harmony wouldn't have survived.
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,"But Twilight was right. Even without the Elements, our friendship is as strong as ever."
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,applejack,I just hope another 'friend' of ours never makes us sorry we had to give them up.
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,discord,"[laughs] Oh, you're talking about me, I presume?"
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,applejack,How'd you guess?
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,discord,My ears were burning.
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,"What are you even doing here, Discord?"
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,discord,"Oh, just a bit of light reading before I head off on my extremely important mission. I suppose you all know that I've been tasked to capture a certain escapee."
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,spike,Big deal.
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,discord,"You're right, Spike. It is a big deal. Seems I possess a magic that gives me quite an important role in Equestria. Maybe they should make me an Alicorn princess."
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,discord,Mmwah! Mmwah!
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,In your dreams!
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,discord,"Oh, I never dream of such things. Ask Princess Luna."
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,applejack,Don't you have a creepy magic-stealin' villain to track down?
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,discord,"Yes, yes, yes, of course. It's just that I couldn't help but notice that Twilight hasn't yet opened this little chest of hers. I-I-It got me thinking, what if what's locked inside is something that could help her prove her royal worth? I only bring it up because she said that she's been feeling like her role as a princess doesn't equate to much."
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,Wait a minute! How do you know how she was feeling?!
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,discord,"[mock sadness] Oh, my. Is eavesdropping not the way you're supposed to find out what your best pals are up to? Woe is me. Will I ever learn the intricate nuances of being a good friend?"
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,discord,"[clears throat] Well in any case, I suppose now is as good a time as any for me to make my exit."
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,applejack,And good riddance!
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,discord,"Oopsie-doopsie, I almost left with the little journal you've all been keeping. What a fascinating read. Haven't you girls just learned so much? I've bookmarked a few of the more interesting passages. You really should take a look! [to Fluttershy, hushed] We're still on for tea later, aren't we, Fluttershy?"
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,I wouldn't miss it.
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,discord,"[singsong] Well, I'll bring the cucumber sandwiches...!"
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,applejack,Sometimes I think the 'reformed' Discord is more obnoxious than the 'before-he-was-reformed' Discord.
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,Indeed.
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,"But he could be right, couldn't he? What if there is something important in that chest?"
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,There's only one way to find out.
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Anything?
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,There must be something in this library that can help me figure out how to open it. The answer's in one of these books. I just know it.
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,discord,"Tirek, I presume?"
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,lord tirek,Discord. You're free?
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,discord,As a bird.
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,lord tirek,I commend you on your escape.
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,lord tirek,"Oh, I should have known you would want to have Equestria all to yourself."
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,lord tirek,Fluttershy? You're not saying you're friends with ponies?
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,discord,Surprise!
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,lord tirek,I am surprised that someone with your intellect does not see this 'friendship' is but a new form of imprisonment. Clearly you've had to abandon your true nature to stay in their good graces.
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,discord,I have done nothing of the sort!
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,lord tirek,"Oh, please, I've seen this before. But he was always weak minded. You are Discord, you are legend, you cannot fall into the same trap that claimed my brother! Help me to grow strong, and be rewarded with something far greater than friendship. Freedom. Once I've stripped these ponies of their magic, nothing would give me greater pleasure than to see their world turned upside down. Who better to do so than the master of chaos himself? Join me, Discord, and reclaim your greatness. Unless, of course, 'pony errand boy' is the role you've always wanted to play in this world."
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"I think I found something! I've been reading our journal, and there's something interesting about the sections that Discord bookmarked. Applejack, do you remember when you had to tell everypony that the tonic Granny bought from the Flim Flam brothers didn't really work?"
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,applejack,How could I forget? It was one of the hardest things I ever had to do.
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,applejack,"[flashback] I hate to disappoint everypony, but there's no way Granny could have made that dive, because this tonic is a fake!"
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,applejack,"[present] And in that moment, I knew I had to be honest. I just knew it. But what's that got to do with openin' the chest?"
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"I've found that each of you has had to face a situation where living up to the Element of Harmony you represent wasn't easy. Fluttershy, it was when you realized that the way to show kindness to the Breezies was by forcing them to leave your home."
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,"Oh, the looks on their poor little faces! But I knew that, as difficult as it was, pushing them away was the kindest thing I could do."
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"Rarity, even after Suri took advantage of your generosity at Fashion Week in Manehattan, you didn't let it cause you to abandon your generous spirit."
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,I simply couldn't have lived with myself if I didn't do something special for the friends who have always been so generous to me!
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"Rainbow Dash, you had the chance to fly with the Wonderbolts at the Equestria Games, but instead you chose to compete with your friends."
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,Sure! But being loyal to my friends was way<U+0096>
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,"Ooh, my turn, my turn!"
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"Pinkie Pie, you realized that seeing your friend laugh was more important than proving you were a better party planner than Cheese Sandwich."
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,Best party I've ever had.
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"It's clear we've all had our moments to shine, Twilight, but I'm with Applejack. What does any of this have to do with the opening of the chest?"
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"All of you had tough choices to make. But when you made the right one and embraced your element, it helped somepony else make the right choice too. Each of you received something from the pony whose life you helped change. I know it sounds crazy, but maybe there's something special about those objects that could lead us to the location of the keys. The chest is connected to the Tree of Harmony, the Tree is connected to the Elements, and the Elements are connected to all of us. There must be a connection! I hate to admit it, but maybe Discord was trying to be a good friend after all."
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"I don't see anything on them that would give us a clue as to where the keys might be. They're just... ordinary, everyday objects."
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,"Come on, Boneless! Give us that key!"
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,I don't think that's going to work.
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,There's still one key missing. The key that represents the element of magic. My element.
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,"Oh, but I'm sure that if we've gotten our keys, you have too, Twilight."
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"Think, Twilight. When have you completed a difficult magical task, and in doing so encouraged another pony to do the same?"
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"I haven't. If I had, I would have written about it in the journal."
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,spike,What's it say?
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,That I'm needed in Canterlot at once!
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,I came as quickly as I could! Is something wrong? Is it Tirek?
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,princess celestia,I'm afraid I put too much trust in Discord and the effect that friendship would have upon him.
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,princess luna,Discord has betrayed the ponies of Equestria and joined forces with Tirek.
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,How could he do this?! I thought our friendship meant something to him! I thought he had changed.
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,princess celestia,"Tirek has stolen enough magic that he now has the strength to steal flight as well. Without Pegasi to control the weather, there will be no rain in Equestria. There is word he has gone after Earth ponies as well. Without their strength, they will not be able to tend the land."
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,princess luna,Ponies will no longer be in control of their world. That power will belong solely to Tirek.
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,princess celestia,"There is no doubt that Tirek is after Alicorn magic. With Discord by his side, we will not be able to stop him from taking it."
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,princess luna,"Once it is in his possession, his power will know no bounds, and all hope will be lost."
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Meghan McCarthy,princess celestia,But there is one solution. It is only by making this sacrifice that Equestria and the lands beyond it might be saved. We must rid ourselves of our magic before Tirek has the chance to steal it from us.
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,"What's wrong, Twilight?"
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,It doesn't seem that my new role as a princess equates to all that much.
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,lord tirek,"I am Lord Tirek, and I will take what should have been mine long ago."
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,princess luna,"With each passing moment, he grows stronger still."
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,princess cadance,And I know just the princess who can stop him.
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,princess celestia,I'm afraid I must call in another to stop Tirek.
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,discord,"[laughs] Oh, you're talking about me, I presume?"
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,discord,Haven't you girls just learned so much?
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,And there's something interesting about the sections that Discord bookmarked.
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Each of you received something from the pony whose life you helped change.
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,There's still one key missing. My element.
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,lord tirek,"Join me, Discord, and reclaim your greatness."
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,princess luna,Discord has betrayed the ponies of Equestria and joined forces with Tirek.
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,princess celestia,There is no doubt that Tirek is after Alicorn magic.
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,princess celestia,We must rid ourselves of our magic before Tirek has the chance to steal it from us.
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,princess luna,"Tirek is set on possessing Alicorn magic. When he comes for us, we cannot have what he is looking for."
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,I'm more than willing to do my part and give up my magic.
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,princess luna,You misunderstand. Our magic cannot just disappear into thin air. Somepony must keep it safe.
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,princess cadance,"That somepony is you, Twilight."
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Why me?
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,princess celestia,"We do not believe that Tirek is aware that a fourth Alicorn princess exists in Equestria. If we transfer our magic to you, Tirek will not know where it has gone."
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,princess cadance,Do you understand what we're asking of you?
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Yes. It's just... I'm only now learning how to control my own Alicorn magic. To take on even more<U+0096>
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,princess cadance,"Twilight, you represent the element of magic. If there is anypony who can do this, it's you."
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"Taking on this task will be one of the most difficult things I'll ever do, but with the help of my friends<U+0096>"
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,princess celestia,"I'm sorry, Princess Twilight, but you must keep your new abilities a secret. I fear that your friends being aware of your new power could put them at great risk. Do you still think you can take on this responsibility?"
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,This is the role I am meant to play as a princess of Equestria! I will not fail to do my duty!
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,princess celestia,Then we must begin at once.
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,discord,[shivers] That can't be right.
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,lord tirek,What can't be right?
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,discord,Nothing. Carry on.
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,princess celestia,[out of breath] It is done.
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,spike,[snoring] You weren't gone very long. Does that mean everything's okay?
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,spike,"In that case, I'm going back to bed. Sun's not up... and neither am I."
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"[hushed] That's strange. The sun should be up by now... [gasps] The sun should be up by now! [inhales, exhales] You can do this."
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,discord,"Shining Armor, why, whatever are you doing here?"
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,shining armor,"Back off, traitor."
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,lord tirek,The only one Discord betrayed was himself. Abandoning his true nature to make friends with weak-minded equines who offer him nothing!
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,shining armor,[weakly] How... could you... do this...?
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,lord tirek,Why don't you go and have a little fun? I won't stand in your way.
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,lord tirek,[inhales] What have you done?! [inhales] Where is your magic?!
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,I have to gain better control. I sure can't practice here.
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,spike,"Uh, Twilight, [pants] where are we goin'?"
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"Oh, uh, hi, Spike. Uh, gotta go... somewhere... else."
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Waaaaah! Whoa!
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,Whoa! Twilight?
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Yiiiipe!
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Ooh!
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,"Oh, my goodness, are you all right?"
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,applejack,"Jumpin' junebugs, Twilight! When did you learn to fly that fast?"
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,I must have caught a particularly strong breeze... or something.
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,"Must have been ""or something"", because there wasn't any breeze up there."
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"I don't know what happened, but I don't really have time to figure it out right now."
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"Another visit to the Castle of the Two Sisters, I presume? We'd be more than happy to accompany you!"
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Not today!
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Tirek may still be a threat. I need you all to stay here and encourage everypony to remain inside.
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,lord tirek,"Getting rid of your magic so that I cannot take it from you? That was your plan? How does it feel, knowing that soon, every Pegasus, unicorn and Earth pony will bow to my will, and that there is nothing you can do to stop it?"
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,princess celestia,"You will not prevail, Tirek."
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,lord tirek,Give my regards to Cerberus.
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,discord,"You meant our will, didn't you?"
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,lord tirek,"Of course. Here, I want you to have something. This was given to me by someone very close to me. I give it to you as a sign of my gratitude and loyalty."
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,discord,"Oh, my! I do love a good accessory. I suppose that's Rarity's influence."
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,lord tirek,"[laughs] Amusing. But we have no time for such things. With the princesses out of the way, we can now<U+0096> is this meant to be humorous?!"
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,discord,"Oh, no, I haven't touched that one yet."
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,lord tirek,There's a fourth? And you did not tell me this?!
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,discord,I just needed some assurance that you truly considered this a team effort. And now I have it.
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,lord tirek,Then where can we find this fourth princess? Where is her castle?
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,lord tirek,Not for much longer.
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,applejack,"Alright, y'all. I think we've warned everypony to stay inside."
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,I'm sure Discord will catch Tirek and this will all be over soon.
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,I'll bet he takes his sweet time.
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,discord,Or perhaps these things just take time.
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,[gasps] You're back! Did you bring the cucumber sandwiches?
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,discord,I did. I imagine they'll be your last decent meal for quite some time.
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,discord,Ta-da!
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,lord tirek,You've gathered up all of them?
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,discord,"And her little dragon, too."
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,[crying] Why are you doing this? I thought we were friends!
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,discord,"Oh, we were. But Tirek offered me so much more than just tea parties. Surely you saw this coming."
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,[crying] I didn't. I really didn't.
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,lord tirek,You really think she'd do anything for them?
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,discord,"If Twilight has magic to give, it will be yours. Soon there won't be a Pegasus, Earth pony or unicorn who will be able to stand up against us."
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,lord tirek,Us? Who said anything about us?
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,discord,You did.
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,lord tirek,"You've helped me grow strong, you've provided the means by which I can obtain Princess Twilight's magic, and now you are no longer of any use to me."
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,discord,[weakly] But you said this was a sign of your gratitude and loyalty. A gift from someone close to you.
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,lord tirek,My brother who betrayed me. It is as worthless as he is.
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,applejack,Surely you saw this comin'.
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,discord,[weakly] I didn't. I truly didn't.
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,I can do this.
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,See! Ha! Perfectly controlled teleportation<U+0096>
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,lord tirek,Princess Twilight!
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,[gasps] Tirek!
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,lord tirek,You have something that belongs to me!
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,lord tirek,Now I understand what your fellow princesses have done!
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,lord tirek,"It appears we are at an impasse. How about a trade, Princess Twilight? Their release for all the Alicorn magic in Equestria."
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,lord tirek,"What's it going to be, Princess?"
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,"[muffled] Don't do it, Twilight!"
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,[muffled] We aren't worth it!
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,discord,"[muffled] Oh, but you are, Fluttershy. You're the pony that taught me that friendship is magic. I had magic and friendship, and now I don't have either."
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,lord tirek,"Enough! I want an answer, and I want it now!"
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"I will give you my magic, in exchange for my friends."
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,lord tirek,As you wish.
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,All of my friends.
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,lord tirek,"After the way he has betrayed you, you still call him a 'friend'?"
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Release him!
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,lord tirek,If that's what you want.
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,discord,"Thank you, Twilight. [to Fluttershy, hushed] I'm sorry."
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,I know.
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,lord tirek,Your turn.
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,lord tirek,[roars] Yes!
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,spike,"Twilight, what were you thinking?!"
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,discord,"Tirek tricked me into believing that he could offer me something more valuable than friendship. But there is nothing worth more. I see that now. He lied when he said that this medallion was given as a sign of gratitude and loyalty. But when I say that it is a sign of our true friendship, I am telling the truth."
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,applejack,You think that might be the last one we need?
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,We have to get to the chest.
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Together! I think we have to do this together!
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,lord tirek,How is this possible?! You have no magic!
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"You're wrong, Tirek! I may have given you my Alicorn magic, but I carry within me the most powerful magic of all!"
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,rarity,Sweet Celestia! Are you all seeing what I'm seeing?
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,But... whose is it?
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,princess celestia,"I believe it is yours, Princess Twilight."
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,princess celestia,You've been wondering what you are meant to do as a princess. Do you know now?
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"As princess, I believe I have the power to spread the magic of friendship across Equestria. That is the role I am meant to have in our world! The role I choose to have! But I didn't defeat Tirek on my own <U+0096> it took all of us to unlock the chest!"
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,princess celestia,Then it is unlikely you are meant to take on this task alone.
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,Wowee!
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,princess celestia,"You are now Twilight Sparkle, the princess of friendship. But what is the princess of friendship without her friends?"
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,discord,"Wait a minute, where's my throne?!"
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,I don't think you're quite there yet.
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,discord,"[chuckles] Yes, well, I suppose not."
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"Each one of us has something special That makes us different, that makes us rare"
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,We have a light that shines within us That we were always meant to share
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Let the rainbow remind you That together we will always shine
The Cutie Map - Part 1,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Let's go through this one more time.
The Cutie Map - Part 1,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,"[sighs] We've been over it like a million times, Twilight! We found all six keys, defeated Tirek, and got this sweet castle! End of story!"
The Cutie Map - Part 1,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"Yes, but why?"
The Cutie Map - Part 1,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,applejack,"I dunno, sugarcube. Maybe it's just your new house and there ain't nothin' more to it than that."
The Cutie Map - Part 1,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"I must say, speaking strictly on aesthetics, there really doesn't need to be more to it. It's all simply divine!"
The Cutie Map - Part 1,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,"I agree with Twilight. And Rarity. And Applejack. And Rainbow Dash. And Pinkie Pie. Oh, and probably Spike."
The Cutie Map - Part 1,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"As princess, I've been chosen to spread the magic of friendship across Equestria. So why would the Tree of Harmony want us to sit in a castle in Ponyville? It doesn't make any sense."
The Cutie Map - Part 1,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,spike,[groans] Is that new? I like it.
The Cutie Map - Part 1,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,spike,This is incredible! It's got all of Equestria!
The Cutie Map - Part 1,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,"Hi, Mom and Dad!"
The Cutie Map - Part 1,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,"But if this is Ponyville, why are our cutie marks over there?"
The Cutie Map - Part 1,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"I don't know. But it seems like the map wants us to find out. The Tree, the chest, this castle, and now the map. How can we not follow it?"
The Cutie Map - Part 1,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,Y'know what? There's a ton of room for dangerous adventure along that route. Count me in!
The Cutie Map - Part 1,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,applejack,"Aw, shoot, I reckon you're right."
The Cutie Map - Part 1,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,"Well, I was planning on organizing my baking sheets, but okay!"
The Cutie Map - Part 1,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,rarity,[sighs] Very well.
The Cutie Map - Part 1,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,"Um, maybe I'll just stay here with Spike."
The Cutie Map - Part 1,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,spike,"Awesome! Me and Big Mac have a huge weekend ahead of us talkin' hoofball, and... and trading hoofball cards, and arguing about hoofball stats..."
The Cutie Map - Part 1,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,"O-o-on second thought, m-m-maybe I'd better go with them. In case they need me."
The Cutie Map - Part 1,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Looks like it's time for a road trip.
The Cutie Map - Part 1,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,spike,"Well, suit yourself. But he's got a Hock Fetlock rookie card I plan to sweet-talk right into these hot little claws."
The Cutie Map - Part 1,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,That's it! That's the place on the map!
The Cutie Map - Part 1,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,rarity,Right. Let's get down there and find the spa.
The Cutie Map - Part 1,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Wait. We don't know why the map sent us here. We shouldn't just walk right in. It could be dangerous.
The Cutie Map - Part 1,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,Yes!
The Cutie Map - Part 1,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,"Stay behind me, everypony! I'm on it!"
The Cutie Map - Part 1,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,applejack,"Careful, Pinkie!"
The Cutie Map - Part 1,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,This is where the map sent us? It looks like the most boring place in Equestria.
The Cutie Map - Part 1,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,applejack,It's just an ordinary village full of ordinary pony folk.
The Cutie Map - Part 1,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,rarity,It could certainly use a few more architectural flourishes. Or any architectural flourishes.
The Cutie Map - Part 1,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,I think it's lovely.
The Cutie Map - Part 1,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,I don't like it. I don't like it one bit. I know smiles. And those smiles? They're just not right.
The Cutie Map - Part 1,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Forget the smiles. Look at the cutie marks.
The Cutie Map - Part 1,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,"Okay, that's weird."
The Cutie Map - Part 1,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,An entire village with the same cutie mark? How can that be?
The Cutie Map - Part 1,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,I bet there's some sort of horrific monster behind it.
The Cutie Map - Part 1,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,What makes you say that?
The Cutie Map - Part 1,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,'Cause fighting a horrific monster would be super-awesome!
The Cutie Map - Part 1,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,applejack,"I reckon we just ought to head into town and talk to some locals, find out what's goin' on."
The Cutie Map - Part 1,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,"Great idea, AJ. Let's go!"
The Cutie Map - Part 1,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,Those smiles are bad news.
The Cutie Map - Part 1,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,This must be the most pleasant place in Equestria!
The Cutie Map - Part 1,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,"Ugh. Thanks a lot, map."
The Cutie Map - Part 1,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,applejack,That there's the Princess of Friendship!
The Cutie Map - Part 1,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,double diamond,What brings you to town?
The Cutie Map - Part 1,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,We're not entirely sure.
The Cutie Map - Part 1,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,double diamond,"I see. Well, all are welcome here in our little village. My name is Double Diamond, and this is Party Favor."
The Cutie Map - Part 1,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,applejack,"Howdy, Double Diamond. I'm Applejack, and this here's Pinkie Pie, Fluttershy, Rarity, Rainbow Dash, and Twilight Sparkle."
The Cutie Map - Part 1,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,double diamond,And you all have your own unique cutie marks.
The Cutie Map - Part 1,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"If you don't mind, has there been any sort of... trouble here, lately?"
The Cutie Map - Part 1,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,double diamond,"Trouble? Why, I don't think we've ever had trouble in our little village."
The Cutie Map - Part 1,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,double diamond,Perhaps you'd care to speak to our founder Starlight Glimmer.
The Cutie Map - Part 1,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,I wish everypony in Equestria was as friendly as these ponies are.
The Cutie Map - Part 1,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,I've got my eye on them. Something's rotten in... whatever the name of this village is that we're in right now!
The Cutie Map - Part 1,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,double diamond,"Starlight, we have some new visitors."
The Cutie Map - Part 1,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,[to Applejack] Be ready to fight. We don't know what's gonna come through that door.
The Cutie Map - Part 1,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,starlight glimmer,Welcome! I'm so pleased to have you here.
The Cutie Map - Part 1,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,double diamond,"This is Applejack, Fluttershy, Pinkie Pie, Rarity, Rainbow Dash, and Twilight Sparkle."
The Cutie Map - Part 1,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,starlight glimmer,"Forgive my bluntness, but I'm assuming it's Princess Twilight Sparkle? We don't get many Alicorns around here."
The Cutie Map - Part 1,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"Yes, but ""Twilight"" is fine."
The Cutie Map - Part 1,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,starlight glimmer,So! How did you hear of our little village?
The Cutie Map - Part 1,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,It's kind of a long story. Let's just say we found it on a map.
The Cutie Map - Part 1,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,"Technically, it's a Tree-chest-castle-map!"
The Cutie Map - Part 1,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,starlight glimmer,"Well, however you found us, we're happy to have you! We're happy to have anypony who wants to experience true friendship for the first time."
The Cutie Map - Part 1,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,applejack,Say what?
The Cutie Map - Part 1,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,starlight glimmer,"Oh, indeed. That's what's so unique about our village, you see. Around here, we don't flaunt our special talents because we don't have any special talents to flaunt."
The Cutie Map - Part 1,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Is that why you all have those cutie marks?
The Cutie Map - Part 1,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,starlight glimmer,Perhaps it would be easier to understand if I gave you a tour of the village!
The Cutie Map - Part 1,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,starlight glimmer,"Heads high, ponies! Marching proud! [whistle blows] All together now! Every one of you! No pony left behind!"
The Cutie Map - Part 1,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,starlight glimmer,"Let's see those big, happy smiles!"
The Cutie Map - Part 1,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,starlight glimmer,You see? Now everypony wins!
The Cutie Map - Part 1,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,starlight glimmer,Other ponies argue Do you ever wonder why? When you think your talent's special You don't see eye-to-eye
The Cutie Map - Part 1,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,"[laughing] You're kidding, right? Give up our cutie marks? No way!"
The Cutie Map - Part 1,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,"Rainbow Dash, don't be so rude. I don't think we should judge them. They all seem perfectly happy with their choice."
The Cutie Map - Part 1,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,"Don't believe their smiles, Fluttershy."
The Cutie Map - Part 1,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"I'm sorry, I guess we're just a little confused by all of this."
The Cutie Map - Part 1,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,starlight glimmer,"We have no judgements here in our village. Each of us was confused once as well, blinded by the false promise of our cutie marks."
The Cutie Map - Part 1,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,"Whoa, whoa, whoa. Is she for real?"
The Cutie Map - Part 1,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"When we were sent to this village, we assumed it was to help in some way. But, well, it doesn't seem like you need any help."
The Cutie Map - Part 1,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,starlight glimmer,"Have you considered perhaps that you might have been sent here so we could help you? After all, nopony has ever come to our village and wanted to leave. Why should you be any different? But that is entirely your choice. Please enjoy our little corner of Equestria. We're all quite fond of it. No doubt you will be as well. Double Diamond, please help our guests with whatever they might need."
The Cutie Map - Part 1,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,double diamond,Of course.
The Cutie Map - Part 1,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,starlight glimmer,"Well, this will certainly provide a boost to our little community. When the rest of Equestria sees that a princess gave up her cutie mark to join us, they'll finally understand what we're trying to accomplish."
The Cutie Map - Part 1,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,A cutie mark is a representation of a pony's unique talents and skills. How is it possible to<U+0097>
The Cutie Map - Part 1,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,rarity,[gasps] What in the name of Equestria is that?!
The Cutie Map - Part 1,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"[gagging] Wha<U+0097> Ooh, er, perhaps another time, good sir, thank you. [whispering] No wonder nopony's wearing anything!"
The Cutie Map - Part 1,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,"[hushed] Really, girls! They may do things a bit differently than we're used to, but that's no reason to be rude."
The Cutie Map - Part 1,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,"[hushed] No, the reason to be rude is that they all keep staring at us!"
The Cutie Map - Part 1,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,double diamond,Need something?
The Cutie Map - Part 1,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"Uh, no! We're good! [hushed] Fluttershy's right. If we're going to get to the bottom of why the map sent us here, we'll need the help of these ponies."
The Cutie Map - Part 1,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,applejack,I think we ran off to the end of Equestria before we even knew what that map was!
The Cutie Map - Part 1,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,"If we were at the end of Equestria, we'd be sitting on a big 'A'! [giggles] Get it?"
The Cutie Map - Part 1,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"Oh, please, Miss Pie! This is hardly the time for jokes! We've come all this way and for what?"
The Cutie Map - Part 1,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"[hushed] Maybe you're right. But we're here now, and it sure feels like something's wrong."
The Cutie Map - Part 1,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,applejack,That and two bits'll get you a cup of cider.
The Cutie Map - Part 1,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,sugar belle,Is this a bad time?
The Cutie Map - Part 1,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,"We shouldn't be bickering like this in front of our new friends. Really, Applejack, you're almost as bad as Rainbow Dash!"
The Cutie Map - Part 1,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,Don't drag me into this!
The Cutie Map - Part 1,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,sugar belle,Is your friendship ending?
The Cutie Map - Part 1,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,Are you crazy?! We'd never let a disagreement get in the way of food!
The Cutie Map - Part 1,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,sugar belle,"O-kay, well, my name is Sugar Belle. What can I bring you? We have: muffins..."
The Cutie Map - Part 1,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Then I guess we'll take six muffins!
The Cutie Map - Part 1,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,Make that twelve! What? I'm hungry!
The Cutie Map - Part 1,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"[hushed] Come on, girls. We've got to stick together. It doesn't matter what happened before, we're here now."
The Cutie Map - Part 1,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,applejack,"I guess you're right. And the sooner we figure out why, the sooner we can go home."
The Cutie Map - Part 1,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,sugar belle,"Forgive me for overhearing, but just a moment ago you were disagreeing, and now it sounds like you're... agreeing."
The Cutie Map - Part 1,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,applejack,Uh-huh...
The Cutie Map - Part 1,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,sugar belle,"Well, you had such differing opinions <U+0096> and cutie marks."
The Cutie Map - Part 1,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"We have differing opinions all the time, darling."
The Cutie Map - Part 1,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,sugar belle,But you look like you're friends.
The Cutie Map - Part 1,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,We are friends. A simple disagreement wouldn't change that.
The Cutie Map - Part 1,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,sugar belle,"I'm sorry, I'm just having a hard time understanding. Different talents lead to different opinions, which lead to bitterness and misery. So... why aren't you bitter and...?"
The Cutie Map - Part 1,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,[choking] Blech! Mmmm... good...
The Cutie Map - Part 1,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,sugar belle,"It's all right. I know I'm not a very good baker. At least, I know I'm not any better than anypony else in the village. Well, I... hope you enjoy our little village!"
The Cutie Map - Part 1,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,sugar belle,[hushed] Come inside before you go! Meet me downstairs!
The Cutie Map - Part 1,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,"Okay, that was weird too."
The Cutie Map - Part 1,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,[hushed] Let's all sit here and eat these muffins and act normal. I think we're being watched.
The Cutie Map - Part 1,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,You think?
The Cutie Map - Part 1,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"[hushed] No, not like that! I mean somepony here doesn't want us talking to Sugar Belle."
The Cutie Map - Part 1,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,applejack,"I got an idea. But you gotta eat all of them muffins, Pinkie."
The Cutie Map - Part 1,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,Me?! Why me?!
The Cutie Map - Part 1,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,applejack,"[hushed] You got a stronger stomach than any of us, and that filly in there might be our best chance at findin' out what the hay is goin' on round here."
The Cutie Map - Part 1,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,applejack,"[stilted] I can't believe you ate all our muffins, Pinkie Pie! We'd best go inside and get some more!"
The Cutie Map - Part 1,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"Nice work, Pinkie."
The Cutie Map - Part 1,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,I've accidentally eaten cardboard tastier than that...
The Cutie Map - Part 1,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Hello? Sugar Belle?
The Cutie Map - Part 1,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,sugar belle,Thank you for coming!
The Cutie Map - Part 1,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Why did you want us to come down here?
The Cutie Map - Part 1,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,sugar belle,So nopony could see what's about to happen.
The Cutie Map - Part 1,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,sugar belle,I love your cutie mark!
The Cutie Map - Part 1,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,sugar belle,"Oh, look at this one! This one's great too! I'd love to have my special talent back even just for a day! Make something besides those disgusting muffins..."
The Cutie Map - Part 1,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,So what's stopping you? Go get your cutie marks back.
The Cutie Map - Part 1,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,sugar belle,I'm not sure Starlight would like that. She wants us all to be happy in our sameness.
The Cutie Map - Part 1,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,How do you take somepony's cutie mark anyway?
The Cutie Map - Part 1,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,But nopony should keep you from your cutie mark. It represents such an essential part of who you are.
The Cutie Map - Part 1,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Can we visit this cave?
The Cutie Map - Part 1,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,starlight glimmer,"I'm delighted you're interested in our cutie mark vault. We hope someday every pony in Equestria will make a pilgrimage here to our little village to have theirs removed too, and our message of [continues under] perfectly equal friendship can finally spread across the land."
The Cutie Map - Part 1,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"[hushed, over] This must be the reason we're here."
The Cutie Map - Part 1,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,"[hushed, over] ""Pilgrimaging""?"
The Cutie Map - Part 1,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"[hushed] No, helping those ponies get their cutie marks back."
The Cutie Map - Part 1,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,"[hushed] Oh, are you sure, Twilight? Maybe they miss them a little, but even they didn't seem all that unhappy."
The Cutie Map - Part 1,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,[hushed] Then why did they want to meet us in secret? And why did they ask us not to tell Starlight who told us about the vault? Something's not right.
The Cutie Map - Part 1,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,starlight glimmer,Just through here! Behold! Our cutie mark vault!
The Cutie Map - Part 1,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,I've never seen anything like it!
The Cutie Map - Part 1,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,starlight glimmer,And here is the Staff of Sameness. It was one of the great Mage Meadowbrook's nine enchanted items. We are incredibly fortunate to have it here. This is the tool that allows us to free ourselves from our marks! I'm curious <U+0096> how did the subject of the vault come up?
The Cutie Map - Part 1,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,"Oh, some ponies were telling us how much they missed their cutie marks, and<U+0097>"
The Cutie Map - Part 1,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Pinkie!
The Cutie Map - Part 1,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,Oops...
The Cutie Map - Part 1,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,starlight glimmer,"[gasps] Were they? Well, it seems you inspire all sorts of free thinking, don't you?"
The Cutie Map - Part 1,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"[laughs nervously] Well, w-we certainly didn't intend to cause any disruptions to your charming little<U+0097>"
The Cutie Map - Part 1,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,starlight glimmer,"Good. Let's just make sure of that, shall we?"
The Cutie Map - Part 1,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,It's a trap!
The Cutie Map - Part 1,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,starlight glimmer,Aw. I don't blame you for what you tried to do here today. You've spent your whole lives thinking those marks are a good thing.
The Cutie Map - Part 1,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Give them back!
The Cutie Map - Part 1,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,starlight glimmer,"Well, now you can spend the rest of your lives here with us! And we'll teach you just how much better life can be without your cutie marks!"
The Cutie Map - Part 2,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"As princess, I've been chosen to spread the magic of friendship across Equestria. So why would the Tree of Harmony want us to sit in a castle in Ponyville?"
The Cutie Map - Part 2,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,spike,This is incredible! It's got all of Equestria!
The Cutie Map - Part 2,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,Why are our cutie marks over there?
The Cutie Map - Part 2,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Seems like the map wants us to find out.
The Cutie Map - Part 2,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,An entire village with the same cutie mark?
The Cutie Map - Part 2,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,starlight glimmer,Welcome!
The Cutie Map - Part 2,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,This must be the most pleasant place in Equestria!
The Cutie Map - Part 2,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,starlight glimmer,I'm delighted you're interested in our cutie mark vault.
The Cutie Map - Part 2,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,It's a trap!
The Cutie Map - Part 2,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,starlight glimmer,Now you can spend the rest of your lives here without your cutie marks!
The Cutie Map - Part 2,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,starlight glimmer,"[slightly muffled, over loudspeaker] In sameness, there is peace. Exceptionalism is a lie."
The Cutie Map - Part 2,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,starlight glimmer,Free yourself from your cutie mark. Choose equality as your special talent.
The Cutie Map - Part 2,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,starlight glimmer,[voice fades under] Difference is frustration. To excel is to fail.
The Cutie Map - Part 2,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,"Hey, this is pretty good!"
The Cutie Map - Part 2,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,starlight glimmer,[under] Be your best by never being your best.
The Cutie Map - Part 2,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"Ugh, we've gotta find a way out of here! I can't take much more of that voice!"
The Cutie Map - Part 2,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,"There, there, Rarity... It's not so bad..."
The Cutie Map - Part 2,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"Yes, it is! Look at those drapes! I have no idea if they're tacky or not!"
The Cutie Map - Part 2,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,"Well, I think they're nice."
The Cutie Map - Part 2,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,rarity,[crying] So do I!
The Cutie Map - Part 2,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,"Oh, thank goodness! Can you help us, little birdie?"
The Cutie Map - Part 2,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,"Go on, now! Fly away and get us help!"
The Cutie Map - Part 2,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,"Oh, even tweets don't make sense any more!"
The Cutie Map - Part 2,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,applejack,[grunts] This door's shut tighter than a... summer of...
The Cutie Map - Part 2,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,applejack,"...uh, piglets in... shoot! I can't even make countryisms no more!"
The Cutie Map - Part 2,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,I don't know! Maybe it'll be super fun to be all the same!
The Cutie Map - Part 2,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,"Sort of. More pleasant than fun, I guess..."
The Cutie Map - Part 2,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"Something odd about that staff. I haven't studied Eastern unicorns as much as I should have, but I'm pretty sure Meadowbrook only had eight magical items, not nine. And I don't remember any of them being a staff."
The Cutie Map - Part 2,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,applejack,"Well, it looks like you'll have plenty of time to try to think about it."
The Cutie Map - Part 2,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,I've got it!
The Cutie Map - Part 2,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,I know how we can get out!
The Cutie Map - Part 2,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,"[sighs] Forget it, Twilight. This door's not opening."
The Cutie Map - Part 2,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,rarity,And I'm afraid the windows are much too small for escape.
The Cutie Map - Part 2,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,But there is a third way.
The Cutie Map - Part 2,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,Of course! Eventually the wind and the weather will wear down the walls until they start to crumble! Then all we have to do is wait for a big enough hole to form and we can just walk out! It's the perfect plan!
The Cutie Map - Part 2,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,I guess.
The Cutie Map - Part 2,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,We don't actually have to escape. They'll just let us out when they think we've accepted their philosophy!
The Cutie Map - Part 2,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,applejack,But they're never gonna believe we switched over in just one night.
The Cutie Map - Part 2,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,There's one of us they might believe.
The Cutie Map - Part 2,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,Oh! Me?!
The Cutie Map - Part 2,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,You've been saying how great this place is since we got here!
The Cutie Map - Part 2,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,"But that's because everypony's so nice and their village is so pretty, and, and... Oh, you're right. They probably would believe me. I hate to lie to them. They've been so welcoming and friendly... aside from locking us in here and trying to brainwash us into abandoning the things that make us special... Okay. I'll do it."
The Cutie Map - Part 2,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,"Woo-hoo! I mean, cool."
The Cutie Map - Part 2,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,But what do I do once I'm out?
The Cutie Map - Part 2,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,You've gotta find a way to get our cutie marks back.
The Cutie Map - Part 2,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,starlight glimmer,"[over loudspeaker] Oh, good morning!"
The Cutie Map - Part 2,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,starlight glimmer,"I trust you had a pleasant night? This way, please. There are some friends who'd like to see you. Gather round, friends, gather round! We've come to ask if any of you are ready to join us! There are so many friends to be made once you realize you don't need your cutie marks or the talents that come with them."
The Cutie Map - Part 2,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,double diamond,We have a welcome ceremony for new friends! The whole village joins together to build you your own cottage<U+0097>
The Cutie Map - Part 2,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,"Not interested! You may have them now, but we're going to get our cutie marks back!"
The Cutie Map - Part 2,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,applejack,"Y'all don't understand, do ya? You can't force nopony to be friends! It don't work like that!"
The Cutie Map - Part 2,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,starlight glimmer,"It's all right, everypony. This is a perfectly normal part of the equalization process for those who haven't... quite seen the light yet. We'll try again tomorrow once you've had a bit more time to consider our philosophy!"
The Cutie Map - Part 2,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,I'd like to join!
The Cutie Map - Part 2,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Fluttershy? How could you?!
The Cutie Map - Part 2,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,"If giving up my cutie mark means I get to stay in this lovely village with these lovely ponies, then I'll do it."
The Cutie Map - Part 2,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,starlight glimmer,"We have a new friend, everypony!"
The Cutie Map - Part 2,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,starlight glimmer,"Now, there's one more order of business. It seems some in our midst might be... dissatisfied with the village life!"
The Cutie Map - Part 2,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,starlight glimmer,"Unfortunately, it's all too true, my friends! [to Fluttershy] Will you kindly tell us the names of those friends who so desperately miss their cutie marks that they would sneak around in the shadows talking to strangers about it? Just so we can be sure your intentions are indeed pure."
The Cutie Map - Part 2,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,"Um, I don't know who they were. Um, I'm sorry. I don't know your names and faces yet."
The Cutie Map - Part 2,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,starlight glimmer,Nonsense! Obviously these ponies must have asked you directly. Kindly point them out!
The Cutie Map - Part 2,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,starlight glimmer,And you're quite certain it was only you?
The Cutie Map - Part 2,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,starlight glimmer,And no thought to the pain you'd cause your friends. Such selfishness.
The Cutie Map - Part 2,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,Don't worry. Fluttershy will have us out of here in no time!
The Cutie Map - Part 2,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,This guy's a barrel of laughs.
The Cutie Map - Part 2,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,[flatly] Laughs don't come in barrels. They come from inside you as your body's response to delight.
The Cutie Map - Part 2,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,applejack,[hushed] So what are we gonna do while Fluttershy's out there lookin' for our [whispering] cutie marks?
The Cutie Map - Part 2,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"We have to stay as positive as we can. If Party Favor sees how much we really do like each other, even though we're all different, maybe we can use him to spread our message to the rest of the village."
The Cutie Map - Part 2,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,rarity,Let's hope they don't convert any of us first.
The Cutie Map - Part 2,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,"Gosh, you really are the nicest ponies I've ever met."
The Cutie Map - Part 2,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,starlight glimmer,"Come. All new friends stay with me until their cottage is completed. Let's get you settled, and then you can enjoy all that our little village has to offer."
The Cutie Map - Part 2,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,"[coughing] Brrrrrr! [sighs] Get the cutie marks back. That's all you've gotta do, Fluttershy. Just sneak through the dark up to that spooky old cave with the scary magical staff and get the cutie marks back."
The Cutie Map - Part 2,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,"Okay, you're doing great. The cave's gotta be close now..."
The Cutie Map - Part 2,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,starlight glimmer,"Excellent work, Double Diamond."
The Cutie Map - Part 2,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,double diamond,"Of course, but I don't understand why you wanted me to bring them here. Fluttershy is one of us now. Surely she can be trusted."
The Cutie Map - Part 2,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,starlight glimmer,This one belongs to a princess. It could be very important to our cause.
The Cutie Map - Part 2,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,double diamond,"But if Twilight Sparkle becomes our friend, then why do we care about this old cutie mark?"
The Cutie Map - Part 2,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,starlight glimmer,"I just want to keep them close until everything is... settled. You may go, Double Diamond."
The Cutie Map - Part 2,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,"Oh, dear. How am I ever going to get the cutie marks back now?"
The Cutie Map - Part 2,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,starlight glimmer,Ow!
The Cutie Map - Part 2,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,starlight glimmer,"Ugh! Starlight, you clumsy foal!"
The Cutie Map - Part 2,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,"[gasps] Oh, no..."
The Cutie Map - Part 2,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,starlight glimmer,"I've got a good feeling about today! So, do any of you have anything you'd like to say? Aw, pity. Well, let's try this again tomorrow, shall we? No new friends today, I'm afraid!"
The Cutie Map - Part 2,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,Wait! I'd like to lock them in.
The Cutie Map - Part 2,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,starlight glimmer,"Marvelous, Fluttershy! That's the spirit! Party Favor, will you join us, please?"
The Cutie Map - Part 2,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,starlight glimmer,It seems there's cause for celebration after all!
The Cutie Map - Part 2,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,starlight glimmer,Such backwards thinking.
The Cutie Map - Part 2,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,starlight glimmer,"Well done, Party Favor! We welcome you back with open hooves!"
The Cutie Map - Part 2,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,"Um, Starlight? I think we might have one more friend joining us today."
The Cutie Map - Part 2,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,starlight glimmer,Is this true?
The Cutie Map - Part 2,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"I-I think so. But I just want to be sure. If I agree to leave my cutie mark in the vault, I'll really be happier?"
The Cutie Map - Part 2,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,starlight glimmer,Just look around! Equality has given us more happiness than you've ever known!
The Cutie Map - Part 2,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,And you wouldn't let me just live here in the village with my old cutie mark?
The Cutie Map - Part 2,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,starlight glimmer,Out of the question. A pony with a different cutie mark in our midst would destroy our entire philosophy. We are all equal here!
The Cutie Map - Part 2,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,Then how do you explain this?!
The Cutie Map - Part 2,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,starlight glimmer,I knew you couldn't be trusted! No! Get away!
The Cutie Map - Part 2,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,starlight glimmer,"Wha... What are you looking at?! They're the problem, not me!"
The Cutie Map - Part 2,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,double diamond,You said cutie marks were evil! You said special talents led to pain and heartache!
The Cutie Map - Part 2,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,starlight glimmer,They do! Don't you see?! Look at them!
The Cutie Map - Part 2,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,sugar belle,Then why? Why did you take ours and not give up your own?
The Cutie Map - Part 2,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,starlight glimmer,"I... I had to, you fools! How could I collect your cutie marks without my magic?!"
The Cutie Map - Part 2,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,starlight glimmer,The staff is a piece of wood I found in the desert! It's my magic that makes all this possible! You'd all still be living your miserable lives thinking you're better than everypony else if it weren't for my magical abilities! I brought you friendship! I brought you equality! I created harmony!
The Cutie Map - Part 2,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,double diamond,You lied to us!
The Cutie Map - Part 2,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,starlight glimmer,So what? E-Everything else I said is true! The only way to be happy is if we're all equal!
The Cutie Map - Part 2,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"Everypony has unique talents and gifts, and when we share them with each other, that's how rea<U+0097>"
The Cutie Map - Part 2,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,starlight glimmer,QUIET!
The Cutie Map - Part 2,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,sugar belle,"You can't have a cutie mark, Starlight! Either we're all equal, or none of us are!"
The Cutie Map - Part 2,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,double diamond,Come on! Let's get our cutie marks back!
The Cutie Map - Part 2,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,Come on! Let's go get our cutie marks!
The Cutie Map - Part 2,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,Our cutie marks aren't in the vault! They're in there with her!
The Cutie Map - Part 2,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,double diamond,"Stand back, everypony!"
The Cutie Map - Part 2,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"Even without my cutie mark, I can tell this is beautiful!"
The Cutie Map - Part 2,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,starlight glimmer,They think they can come to my village and disrupt my life? Let's see how they like spending the rest of their lives without their precious cutie marks!
The Cutie Map - Part 2,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,They're gone! They were right over there!
The Cutie Map - Part 2,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,Look!
The Cutie Map - Part 2,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,These are amazing!
The Cutie Map - Part 2,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,sugar belle,There's a whole network of caves up there! Your cutie marks will be gone forever!
The Cutie Map - Part 2,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,applejack,"Then let's get moving, y'all!"
The Cutie Map - Part 2,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,"Oh, come on!"
The Cutie Map - Part 2,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,starlight glimmer,Are you all so willing to give up everything because of these strangers?!
The Cutie Map - Part 2,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,sugar belle,"We gave up everything for you, because we thought you were our friend!"
The Cutie Map - Part 2,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,I can't believe we have to count on these other ponies to save our cutie marks!
The Cutie Map - Part 2,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"If we hadn't come here to help them, they'd still be living under her rules! Now it's their turn to help us!"
The Cutie Map - Part 2,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,And I know they can do it!
The Cutie Map - Part 2,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,sugar belle,My newest recipe <U+0096> snow pie!
The Cutie Map - Part 2,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,She's gonna get away!
The Cutie Map - Part 2,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,double diamond,Whoa! These are my old skis! This is where I first met Starlight!
The Cutie Map - Part 2,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,double diamond,Feel like an air drop?
The Cutie Map - Part 2,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,applejack,"Yee-haw! Finally, I can buck like a five-bit snake herder in an Appleloosa ranch house again!"
The Cutie Map - Part 2,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,"And you got your countryisms back, too!"
The Cutie Map - Part 2,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,starlight glimmer,Wh<U+0096> I studied that spell for years! How can you<U+0097>
The Cutie Map - Part 2,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,I studied magic for years too! But what I didn't know then was that studying could only take me so far. Each of my friends has taught me something different about myself! It was their unique gifts and passions and personalities that helped bring out the magic inside of me! I never would have learned that I represent the element of magic without these five! And I certainly wouldn't be here to stop you now!
The Cutie Map - Part 2,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,starlight glimmer,Spare me your sentimental nonsense! I gave these ponies real friendships they never could've had otherwise!
The Cutie Map - Part 2,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,double diamond,How do you know that?! You never even gave us a chance!
The Cutie Map - Part 2,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,She's getting away!
The Cutie Map - Part 2,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,double diamond,We'll never find her in there!
The Cutie Map - Part 2,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"We just have to hope that when she's had a chance to think it over, she realizes that you all have taught her something."
The Cutie Map - Part 2,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Does that mean you'll stay in the village?
The Cutie Map - Part 2,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,double diamond,This is a chance for all of us to get to know each other again for the very first time!
The Cutie Map - Part 2,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,sugar belle,And I finally have a chance to bake something besides terrible muffins!
The Cutie Map - Part 2,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,Now those are real smiles.
The Cutie Map - Part 2,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,applejack,I'll never get used to that.
The Cutie Map - Part 2,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,rarity,I think it's divine.
The Cutie Map - Part 2,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,Does that mean that the map is calling us somewhere else?
The Cutie Map - Part 2,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,I have a feeling it means our work here is done.
The Cutie Map - Part 2,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,applejack,"Looks like you were right, Twilight. The map did have a reason for sendin' us here. We brought real friendship to these here ponies. Guess that's why you're the Princess of Friendship."
The Cutie Map - Part 2,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"But the map didn't send me. It sent us. You're a part of me, all of you. And there's no doubt you're a part of my mission to spread friendship too."
The Cutie Map - Part 2,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,"This feels like an ending! It doesn't have to be an ending yet, right? 'Cause that Sugar Belle can bake!"
The Cutie Map - Part 2,Scott Sonneborn & M. A. Larson; story by Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Maybe we can stay a little while longer. Come on!
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,fluttershy,"Phew! Thanks for helping me get them so fresh and clean, Twilight."
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,"No problem, happy to do it!"
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,fluttershy,"You probably can't wait to get back to your castle and take your own bath, huh?"
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,Aren't there more animals that need cleaning?
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,fluttershy,"I think you and I are the only ones left, and I can't wait to get the mud out of my mane."
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,"Oh, no! Angel got dirty! I'd better stay longer to help give him a bath too!"
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,fluttershy,"Thank you ever so much for staying to give Angel a bath too, but, um... I think he's dry."
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,fluttershy,Goodness! It's gotten late! You really didn't have to stay all day. Not that we don't appreciate it. Isn't that right?
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,fluttershy,"I for one am exhausted. [yawns] Plus, I really need to rest up for that big pancake breakfast tomorrow. [beat] And I'm sure you have to get the castle ready."
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,No! The castle's... fine! But maybe I'd better see if Pinkie Pie needs help with the pancakes!
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,fluttershy,"[knocking] Um, Angel?"
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,applejack,"[gulps] Mm, these are delicious, Pinkie Pie!"
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,pinkie pie,"[slurps, gulps] Thanks! Twilight spent all night helping me pick the flavor! I kept thinking we'd found the right one, but she insisted I make even more to try. And more. And more and more and more and more! It was like she never wanted to<U+0097>"
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,fluttershy,Leave?
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,pinkie pie,"Exactly! [chomp] Eventually we ran out of time so we just went with every-berry-any-chip-surprise! [to Rarity, hushed] The surprise is I lost a measuring spoon in the batter. Somepony's gonna get a very special pancake!"
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,rainbow dash,"Up all night, huh? Is that why she's so, uh... out of it?"
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,fluttershy,"Um, I don't mean to sound unappreciative, but has anypony else noticed that Twilight has been a little too helpful lately?"
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,applejack,"Now that you mention it, she was lendin' a hoof at Sweet Apple Acres the other day and stuck around 'til near midnight. Dug up fifty tree-plantin' holes when all I needed was ten."
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,rarity,She spent an entire afternoon rearranging a single gem drawer at the boutique. An entire afternoon!
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,rainbow dash,"You think that's weird? She raced me, like, a hundred times the other day. And lost every time! She just kept goin'! Best out of ten, best out of twenty, best out of a hundred! I mean, I know hanging out with me is awesome, but it was like she'd rather keep losing than<U+0097>"
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,fluttershy,Leave?
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,rainbow dash,Yeah. Who does that?
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,applejack,"Somepony who's avoidin' somethin', that's who. Soon as she wakes up, we're gonna find out what."
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,pinkie pie,[coughs] I win!
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,"Huh?! I'm pancake! I mean, awake..."
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,applejack,"Uh, Twilight? Is there somethin' you wanna tell us?"
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,rarity,"You know how much we appreciate all you do for us, and we simply adore having you around... but... we worry you might be... ahem... avoiding something else?"
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,"Oh, has it been that obvious? I've been... the thing is... I know it's silly, but I... I've been avoiding... this place."
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,rarity,[gasps] Why in Equestria would you want to avoid such a gorgeous castle?
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,pinkie pie,"Yeah, this place has everything! Big tall ceilings that make you feel tiny! Shiny new floors that are cold to the touch! Brrr! And it even has loooong empty hallways!"
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,pinkie pie,"Okay, I get it."
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,The castle is amazing. But it just... [sighs] It doesn't feel like home.
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,rarity,"[chuckling] Oh, is that all? Why, you simply need to decorate, darling. Make this space your own!"
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,It's just so daunting! Look how big it is! I-I don't even know where to start!
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,rarity,"You can start by letting us do it for you. We will make this the castle of your dreams while you go to the Ponyville spa for some much needed rest and relaxation. I'm saying this with love, but... have you looked in a mirror lately? I've never seen you look this... mmmm..."
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,fluttershy,Frazzled?
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,rarity,Yes! That is absolutely the word I was going to use.
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,"Ooh, I guess I do need a little help. And so does my castle. And I just know you'll do a great job, because nopony knows me better than you."
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,applejack,We'll make this place feel cozier than hot cider on a rainy day.
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,rainbow dash,"[gasps] There's gonna be cider?! [beat] Uh, I mean, let's decorate!"
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,spike,"Oh, no! Did I miss the pancakes?!"
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,spike,"I sleep like a baby under that cold, cavernous ceiling."
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,rarity,"Spike, I'm so glad you're here!"
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,spike,Really?
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,rarity,Yes! You're taking Twilight to the spa!
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,applejack,"Come on, y'all! We've got work to do!"
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,rainbow dash,Let's all work together To make this castle shi-i-ine
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,rarity,"Once we add some sparkle It'll feel, it'll feel, it'll feel..."
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,applejack,Crates of apples an' bales o' hay Just makes ya feel at home
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,fluttershy,Furry friends and some popinjays So she won't be alone
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,pinkie pie,There's nothing like balloons and confetti To greet you every time you walk through the door
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,rainbow dash,She'll need this and those Posters of all my heroes How could anypony awesome ever ask for more?
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,rarity,Bright curtains of flowing silk and lace
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,rainbow dash,This picture of me winning a race
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,pinkie pie,Party cannons to give her a surprise
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,applejack,Hoes and rakes and some more garden supplies
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,fluttershy,"Getting hugs from this nice, big, friendly bear"
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,rarity,Decorate with some gemstones bright and rare
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,rainbow dash,More of this and that
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,pinkie pie,Don't forget the party hats
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,rainbow dash,How could anypony awesome ask for more than that?
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,applejack,Let's all work together
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,fluttershy,To show that we have shown
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,rarity,Princess Twilight Sparkle
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,rainbow dash,We sure did... something.
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,pinkie pie,[simultaneously] Together.
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,rarity,[simultaneously] All together.
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,rainbow dash,"[unconvincingly] Fluttershy, I love that you brought so many animals."
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,fluttershy,Are these your trophies?
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,rainbow dash,I prefer to think of them as everypony's trophies but with my name permanently etched onto them.
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,rarity,"[unconvincingly] [laughs] My my, Applejack, bringing the outdoors inside, it's... earthy... What a lovely touch! [sniffs, heaves] Are these quilts vintage?"
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,spike,"Hey guys, how do my claws look<U+0097>Sweet Celestia!"
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,rarity,"Oh, Spike! Are you and Twilight done already?"
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,spike,"Don't worry, I ordered her the super-deluxe mane blow-out! She'll be a while. Man, this place looks terrible!"
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,fluttershy,Thank goodness somepony said something!
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,rainbow dash,"It's pretty bad, right?"
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,applejack,This place looks like a mishmash of knickknacks.
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,rarity,"Hmm, I suppose it is a little cluttered."
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,pinkie pie,What are you guys talking about? I think it looks super fun!
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,pinkie pie,Whee!
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,fluttershy,"Oh! Oh, no! Please don't do that! If you all just take a deep breath and calm down<U+0097>"
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,rarity,No! That bunting is embroidered by hoof! Don't you move one more paw!
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,rarity,"Everypony, stop!"
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,pinkie pie,"Okay, now it's a mess."
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,rainbow dash,What're we gonna do?!
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,spike,"I dunno. But Twilight's blow-out won't take that long. If she was avoiding the castle before, she'll never set hoof in here now!"
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,rainbow dash,"Come on, guys, we've gotta do something! Twilight's counting on us!"
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,rarity,"Spike, you've got to get back to that spa and stall her! Whatever you do, don't let her come home!"
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,spike,"Like, forever? But we live here."
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,spike,"Anything for you, Rarity..."
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,applejack,"Okay, we all agree the castle is too cluttered, right? So why doesn't everypony take one of their own decorations out and we'll see how it looks?"
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,"Spike, you're back! How do I look?"
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,spike,Great!
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,"And more importantly, how does the castle look?"
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,spike,Great?
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,I can't wait to go home and see it!
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,spike,"Great! I mean, no! I mean, uh, I'm not... quite ready to go yet. Uh, why don't we have a massage? I was really hoping to get, uh... this thingy!"
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,[reading] The 'Extra-strength-hot-stone-deep-tissue massage'?
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,spike,[gulps] Yep!
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,"I think I'll just have a traditional massage, but you go for it."
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,bulk biceps,"Yeah! Let's do this, little dragon!"
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,applejack,"Come on, Rarity. Everypony has taken somethin' out except you."
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,rarity,"Ooh, I know! I simply can't decide."
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,rainbow dash,How about this?
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,rarity,No! Not that! Anything but that!
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,rainbow dash,How about these?
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,rarity,"Oh, but those brighten up the whole room! They're my favorite accent!"
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,rainbow dash,Then let's lose the curtains! The room wouldn't need brightening if they weren't making it so dark!
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,rarity,Not them! They're my favorite too!
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,rainbow dash,"[growls] They can't all be your favorite! Okay, I'm taking down the portrait. We all know what we look like."
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,rarity,"[huffs] Well, the room still looks a little bit cluttered, doesn't it? Perhaps I'll take down a poster or two. Only to be helpful, of course!"
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,applejack,"Okay, everypony calm down. I'm sure we can find a way to remove the clutter together."
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,rarity,"You're absolutely right, dear."
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,applejack,"Hey, those are my warmin' quilts!"
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,pinkie pie,"Fluttershy, tell your birds to stop pecking at my balloons!"
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,fluttershy,I guess they must not like being scared out of their wits by exploding confetti cannons or something.
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,pinkie pie,But we can't get rid of the cannons! I don't remember where I hid them.
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,rarity,Allow me to help.
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,applejack,"Oh, no, I'll help you."
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,rainbow dash,Not if I help you first!
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,"[sighs] Great suggestion, Spike. I feel totally relaxed."
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,spike,[joints cracking] Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow...
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,You want to hop on? Maybe I can get us to the castle faster.
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,spike,[cracks] Ow! I mean... how... nice is this day? I was hoping we could take the scenic way back.
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,I don't know.
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,spike,Come on. Walking is good for post-massage circulation.
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,Really? I've never heard that theory.
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,"[sighs] I really miss this place, Spike. We had so many wonderful memories here."
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,spike,"We did, didn't we...?"
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,"Oh, Spike, I'm so sorry. Of course losing the Golden Oak Library was hard for you too. [beat] I've got an idea. Why don't we have the girls add some things to make the castle feel more like your home as well?"
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,spike,Really?
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,Hop on!
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,Ow! What are you doing?
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,spike,"I, um... I just thought of what I want!"
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,"Oh, okay. What is it?"
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,spike,"It's a... well, I want a... it's... I kind of need a... a bed!"
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,I thought you said you sleep like a baby in the castle.
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,spike,[scoffs] Everypony knows babies are terrible sleepers. Let's go!
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,rarity,There! Now nothing is cluttering the castle!
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,rainbow dash,You're right. There is literally nothing cluttering this castle.
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,fluttershy,What do we do now?
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,rarity,"I hate to be the bearer of more bad news, but it's almost sunset. If we don't figure this out soon, it's going to look like we didn't lift a hoof to help her!"
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,rainbow dash,Why is this so hard?! We're Twilight's best friends! This should be easy for us!
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,applejack,"She said it herself <U+0096> if anypony should be able to make her feel comfortable in her new home, it's us. If we can't do it..."
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,fluttershy,Then Twilight will be stuck living in a castle that makes her feel... sad!
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,pinkie pie,"Wow, Fluttershy! I didn't know you could be loud enough to echo!"
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,applejack,"Calm down, Pinkie. We just need to figure out what we did wrong so we can make it right."
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,rarity,"Well, I didn't do anything wrong! I did exactly what I would do if this were my home!"
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,rainbow dash,But it's not your home. It's Twilight's home!
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,rarity,Where she keeps all her Rainbow Dash trophies?
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,rainbow dash,Touch<e9>.
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,fluttershy,Maybe we're all a little guilty of making ourselves feel at home instead of Twilight.
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,applejack,"Come on, y'all. We just need to think about Twilight. What was it she'd loved about livin' in the Golden Oak Library?"
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,fluttershy,"Oh, everything! The books, the smell of books, the joy she felt from organizing books..."
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,rainbow dash,"Remember that time I crashed into all those books attempting my sonic rainboom after you guys just cleaned up? [laughs, sighs] That was good times."
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,applejack,"Yeah, for you, maybe."
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,rarity,"Oh, and Applejack, remember when we were stuck having a sleepover there? That turned out to be so much fun!"
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,pinkie pie,"Remember the time it got blown up to smithereens?! Wait, no, that was the worst."
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,applejack,"We had a lot of good memories there, though. That's what made the Golden Oak Library home."
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,applejack,[gasps] That's it!
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,How's that one? Too soft? Too hard? Too lumpy?
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,spike,Um... Just right! I'll take it!
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,"Oh, thank goodness. I thought you'd never find one you liked! Let's find a salespony and get out of here."
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,spike,"Sounds good to meee<U+0097>I... nn, um, uh, heh... did you hear that? [mimes squeaky springs] Too squeaky! Better keep looking!"
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,applejack,[sighs] Maybe my plan won't work after all.
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,rarity,"Of course it will, darling. I can see it! You and Fluttershy stay here. Rainbow Dash and Pinkie Pie, you come with me. We're going shopping! We'll meet back at the castle."
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,applejack,It's not the things that ya gather 'round
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,fluttershy,It's not how much you own
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,rarity,The things that hold the meaning in your life Are the memories you've sown
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,Hello? We're home!
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,"Oh, I, uh... love what you've done with the place. You did such a good job of... preserving the integrity of the original design."
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,spike,"Aw, come on! It looks exactly the same! Do you know how hard it was to keep her from coming back here?! I never want to see another dust ruffle as long as I live!"
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,Wait. Keep me from coming back here?
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,rarity,[laughs nervously] It took a teensy bit longer than we thought.
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,applejack,What really makes home feel like home isn't what it looks like. It's the memories you make when you're there.
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,rarity,So we've made something that celebrates the memories we've made with you since you moved to Ponyville.
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,fluttershy,The ornaments on the chandelier are reminders of all the fun we've had together.
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,pinkie pie,That one shows your party at the Golden Oak Library welcoming you to Ponyville!
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,fluttershy,The time we shared donuts after the Grand Galloping Gala!
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,rarity,We were hoping that being able to look at your beautiful old memories would inspire you to make new ones.
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,applejack,"And the best part of it is, it's made from the roots of the Golden Oak Library, so you'll never forget where you came from."
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,It's exactly what the castle needed. And I am ready to make new memories here.
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,pinkie pie,Then let's start right now with a new memory cake! Seven layer what's-that-flavor mystery surprise! These might be chocolate chips or they might be super-spicy black beans!
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,"Let's go to the dining room. It's a little sparse, but [door opens] at least there's a table and chairs. Whoa! What happened in here? Last I checked, this place was empty!"
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,rarity,I couldn't help myself! It was just begging for the personal touch!
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,applejack,"Truth be told... I couldn't either. Your kitchen might have some rustic farm decor, Twilight."
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,rainbow dash,And there may or may not be some Daring Do posters up in your library.
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,fluttershy,And some stuffed animals in your bedroom.
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,What was that?!
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,applejack,[sighs] One of Pinkie Pie's confetti cannons.
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,pinkie pie,What? It's not my fault I hid them so well!
Castle Sweet Castle,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,applejack,"[simultaneously] Oh, Pinkie..."
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,apple bloom,"Hear ye, hear ye! This meeting of the Cutie Mark Crusaders is now in session! Who wants to do roll-call?"
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,scootaloo,I'm pretty sure we're all here.
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,sweetie belle,"Yeah. Apple Bloom, what's this all about?"
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,apple bloom,"Oh, nothin'... except this letter from Babs Seed sayin' she's got her cutie mark!"
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,apple bloom,She says it's a pair of scissors!
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,scootaloo,So... she's good at cutting stuff?
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,sweetie belle,Of course! She was always fussing with her bangs and tail! I'll bet she grows up to be a celebrity stylist!
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,apple bloom,"But if she spends all her time cuttin' hair, who's gonna run the Manehattan CMCs?"
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,scootaloo,"Well, not Babs. She can't be a Cutie Mark Crusader if she's already got her cutie mark."
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,apple bloom,"Oh, wow. I guess you're right."
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,sweetie belle,"I'm glad she's happy, but I sure wouldn't want to be up to my flank in mane hair all day. Can you imagine getting stuck with a cutie mark you didn't like?"
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,apple bloom,No... or at least I hadn't...
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,sweetie belle,"Don't worry, Apple Bloom. Most of your family has apple-related cutie marks. I bet yours will be, too. And what's not to like about apples?"
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,scootaloo,"There's the core, and sour apples, and rotten apples, and apples with worms in them<U+0097> What?"
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,sweetie belle,Not helping.
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,apple bloom,"I guess I just spent so much time worryin' about how to get a cutie mark, I never even thought about what would happen after. There's just so many things I never considered."
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,applejack,"I'm sure there are, but you don't need to<U+0097>"
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,apple bloom,What if I finally get my cutie mark and I don't like it? What if I get my cutie mark and nopony likes me?
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,applejack,"Well, that's just ridicu<U+0097>"
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,apple bloom,"What if the Crusaders drift apart? I mean, we won't really be the Cutie Mark Crusaders anymore! [gasps] What if it's not an apple?! Will I have to move out?! Where will I live?!"
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,applejack,"All right, that's enough, sugarcube. Those are way too many questions to answer all in one night."
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,apple bloom,But<U+0097>
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,applejack,And nopony's gonna make ya move out.
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,apple bloom,"Are you sure, Applejack?"
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,applejack,"Of course, I'm sure. Now get some sleep. You'll see. Everything will be better in the mornin'. Hush now, little sister You're loved by all you know You'll never lose their friendship No matter where you go"
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,apple bloom,[yawns] No matter what I get.
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,apple bloom,Hoo-ee! Nothin' like a good night's sleep!
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,applejack,[muffled] Breakfast!
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,apple bloom,"You were right, Applejack! I feel much better! I don't know what I was so worried about last night!"
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,applejack,"See, now what did I tell you? A good night's sleep'll fix just about an<U+0097> Well, no wonder you were so worked up!"
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,apple bloom,What? What is it?
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,applejack,Looks like somepony got her cutie mark!
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,apple bloom,[gasps] I can't believe it! I got my cutie mark! I got my cutie mark! [rumbling and echoing] I got my cutie mark! Wait 'til I tell the others that my cutie mark is a... a... What is it?
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,applejack,I have no idea what it means.
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,apple bloom,Infestations? You mean like... parasprites?
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,apple bloom,Twittermites?
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,apple bloom,Pest ponies?
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,apple bloom,Take over?
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,apple bloom,I'm sorry. I guess this just wasn't what I was expectin'.
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,apple bloom,"The touch? Oh, sorry."
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,apple bloom,"Wait, what do you mean?"
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,apple bloom,Ow!
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,apple bloom,What do I do?!
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,apple bloom,Twittermites!
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,apple bloom,Bugbugbugbugbugbugbug!
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,apple bloom,"Now, hold on! I'm sure this job is real important, but... I don't think I wanna call bugs for the rest of my life. Hey, where'd he go?"
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,diamond tiara,"Well, well, well! Look at the new bug pony!"
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,apple bloom,It's pest pony.
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,silver spoon,"Eh, it sure is! Ew!"
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,diamond tiara,I might've known you'd end up with the worst cutie mark ever!
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,silver spoon,"But look on the bright side! Whenever you need a friend, you can just go out and catch one!"
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,apple bloom,That's not funny.
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,diamond tiara,"Heeere, friendfriendfriendfriendfrieeend!"
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,apple bloom,Stop it!
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,apple bloom,You know what? My cutie mark isn't the worst! You two are!
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,apple bloom,"[sighs] I hate to think that Diamond Tiara is right, but... this cutie mark sure isn't what I was hoping for."
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,apple bloom,Who's there?! What do you mean?!
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,apple bloom,"Well, if you know how to wave a hoof and erase a terrible cutie mark, you go right ahead!"
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,apple bloom,Huh. Now that is some serious magic.
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,apple bloom,Hey! Where's everypony goin'?!
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,apple bloom,Mayor! What's goin' on?!
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,mayor mare,"Apple Bloom, you've got to get your family out of town!"
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,apple bloom,"Twittermites! Here, bugbugbugbugbugbug!"
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,apple bloom,"Here, bugs!"
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,apple bloom,"Come on, here!"
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,applejack,Apple Bloom! What in tarnation are you doin'?!
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,apple bloom,"I'm tryin' to stop the infestation, of course!"
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,applejack,Only a pest pony can do that! Now come on! We gotta skedaddle!
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,apple bloom,But I've gotta do somethin'!
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,applejack,Are you crazy?!
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,apple bloom,Aaaaaaahhh!
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,apple bloom,Whoo-ee. That's what I call a nightmare. It seemed so real.
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,applejack,[muffled] Breakfast!
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,apple bloom,Applejack! You are not gonna believe the dream I just had! I guess I needed more sleep than I thought!
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,applejack,"See, now what did I tell you? A good night's sleep'll fix just about<U+0097> [gasps] Well, no wonder you were so worked up!"
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,apple bloom,What?
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,applejack,Looks like somepony got her cutie mark!
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,apple bloom,Again?! I mean... I did? Woo-hoo! Potion making! Now that's more like it!
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,applejack,More like what?
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,apple bloom,Never mind. I'm just glad Princess Twilight's lessons finally paid off!
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,applejack,"I expect you want to run off to the clubhouse and tell your friends all about your new cutie mark. But before you go, make sure you do all your... chores...?"
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,apple bloom,Whooo!
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,scootaloo,Why all the excitement?
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,sweetie belle,"Yeah, what's going on?"
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,apple bloom,"[coyly] Oh, nothin'... except this brand new cutie mark!"
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,scootaloo,That's amazing!
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,sweetie belle,Wow!
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,apple bloom,I know!
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,scootaloo,That's so cool!
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,apple bloom,I don't suppose either of you got yours?
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,scootaloo,Nope.
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,sweetie belle,Me neither...
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,apple bloom,"I know it's silly, but I'd always hoped we'd get our cutie marks together."
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,scootaloo,Me too...
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,sweetie belle,But I'm still super excited for you!
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,scootaloo,Absolutely!
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,apple bloom,I know! [knocks on podium] Let's call this meeting to order! I'm sure the three of us can figure out how to get two more cutie marks.
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,sweetie belle,"Um, yeah... the thing is..."
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,apple bloom,What?
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,scootaloo,"Well, you can't be a Cutie Mark Crusader if you've already got your cutie mark..."
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,apple bloom,"Oh, yeah... Just like Babs Seed... Well, I could just sit quietly in the corner 'til you two figure out what you're gonna do..."
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,sweetie belle,"Well, technically the clubhouse is for Crusaders only."
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,apple bloom,"Oh. Right. I guess I should just come back later, then...?"
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,sweetie belle,"Why? I mean, you can't come in then either."
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,apple bloom,Oh.
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,sweetie belle,Rules are rules.
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,scootaloo,I don't even think we're still supposed to be friends.
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,apple bloom,What?!
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,apple bloom,"Sweetie Belle! Scootaloo! Come on, fillies, this isn't funny!"
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,apple bloom,"No! I mean, w<U+0097> yeah, I mean... Well, I got mine, but my friends didn't get theirs, and now there's all kinds of trouble!"
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,apple bloom,"I guess so... I mean, if I was a blank flank again, there wouldn't be a problem!"
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,scootaloo,"Hey, Apple Bloom. Why'd you want to meet here?"
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,apple bloom,"Well, us blank flanks have to meet somewhere!"
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,scootaloo,"Um, actually, Apple Bloom, we... both sort of got our cutie marks."
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,apple bloom,You did?! What are they?
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,scootaloo,"Oh, we don't have time to go into all that."
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,sweetie belle,And we certainly don't have time to hang out at an old clubhouse.
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,scootaloo,"Yeah, we've got responsibilities now."
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,sweetie belle,But maybe we'll see you later.
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,scootaloo,Much later.
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,apple bloom,"Wait! Hold on! I can get my cutie mark back, I think! Rrgh! I mean, I got it once, right? Oh, just wait a second! Nooooooooooo!"
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,apple bloom,What in Equestria's goin' on?!
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,applejack,[muffled] Breakfast!
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,apple bloom,I'm not so sure sleep is the cure-all Applejack thinks it is.
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,apple bloom,"Uh... Applejack? I know you said sleep is supposed to make me feel better, but I'm pretty sure it's makin' me feel worse."
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,applejack,"See, now what did I tell you? A good night's sleep'll fix<U+0097> Well, no wonder you were so worked up..."
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,apple bloom,Wh<U+0097> Didn't you hear what I said?! I was trying to<U+0097>
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,granny smith,"Weeeell, what do we have here?"
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,apple bloom,"What is it, Granny? What's wrong?!"
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,granny smith,"Oh, nothin', right, Applejack?"
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,applejack,"Right... Nothin' at all... Right, Big Mac?"
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,big mcintosh,"Truth is, Apple Bloom, it's your cutie mark."
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,applejack,Eeyup.
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,apple bloom,"Oh, no! What is it now?!"
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,big mcintosh,"[echoing] Well, I can tell you what it ain't. It ain't no apple."
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,granny smith,Nnope!
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,apple bloom,What?!
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,applejack,[in Big McIntosh's voice] And we don't have room for non-apples.
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,big mcintosh,[in Applejack's voice] Nnope.
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,granny smith,[in Big McIntosh's voice] Time for you to mosey on. You can't stay here.
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,apple bloom,But this is my home!
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,big mcintosh,"Oh, and you're gonna have to change your name."
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,granny smith,Eeyup!
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,big mcintosh,"I think just 'Bloom' has a nice ring to it, don't you, Applejack?"
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,applejack,Eeyup!
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,apple bloom,Noooooooooo!
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,apple bloom,Ugh!
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,apple bloom,"Alright, this is getting ridiculous. [pause] Whoo-ee! I never thought I'd be so happy to not get a cutie mark. What the?!"
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,apple bloom,[frustrated grunt] I don't wanna see another cutie mark as long as I live!
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,apple bloom,"All right, whoever you are! I dunno what spell you went and cast on me, but I want it to stop right now!"
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,apple bloom,Rrrgh! Why would I want you to torment me with nightmares?!
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,apple bloom,I don't want your help! Just get away from me!
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,princess luna,"Oh, Apple Bloom, you can't get away from your own shadow."
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,apple bloom,Princess Luna?! My shadow? What do you mean? It's just me? You mean I've been doin' all this to myself?
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,princess luna,"Of course, Apple Bloom. It's your dream."
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,apple bloom,"If I've been dreamin' this whole time, why don't I just wake up?"
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,princess luna,"Sometimes we can worry about a thing so much, the fear can make us feel we're trapped in a nightmare. I don't suppose there's anything you're particularly afraid of, is there?"
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,apple bloom,Yeah... I guess I've been pretty worried about gettin' my cutie mark.
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,apple bloom,"But if I like who I am, do you think other ponies will too?"
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,princess luna,Of course.
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,apple bloom,Then it doesn't matter what my cutie mark is!
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,princess luna,Indeed.
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,apple bloom,But that's so simple! I must be the only pony in the universe this worried about her cutie mark.
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,princess luna,"Oh, I wouldn't say that."
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,apple bloom,Scootaloo and Sweetie Belle are havin' nightmares too?
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,princess luna,"It's been a busy night for us all, but I think it's time to bring it to a close."
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,princess luna,"I know you've all had a lot on your minds tonight, but I think Apple Bloom has something she'd like to share before you wake."
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,sweetie belle,We're still asleep?
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,scootaloo,Cool!
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,apple bloom,"Well, I guess I should call this dream meeting of the Cutie Mark Crusaders to order!"
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,apple bloom,"I know we all got pretty anxious when we found out Babs got her cutie mark, but I for one don't want to have nightmares every night from now until we get ours!"
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,scootaloo,Me neither!
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,apple bloom,"And even though we're all a little scared, a cutie mark won't change who we are or how everypony feels about us!"
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,sweetie belle,It's lucky we're all scared of the same things. That way we can help and remind each other to just be who we are!
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,princess luna,"And when the day comes that you all finally get your cutie marks, you can be sure they'll fit you to a T."
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,apple bloom,Exactly!
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,scootaloo,Do you fillies think that Babs is worried or scared about some of this stuff?
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,apple bloom,I know! Let's put together a care package for her!
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,sweetie belle,That way she'll know she isn't alone!
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,apple bloom,"We wouldn't want her to think that just because she isn't a Crusader, we can't still be friends! But, uh... maybe we should wait 'til we wake up."
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,princess luna,Good idea.
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,applejack,There ain't no call to worry So don't you cry or fret
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,apple bloom,A cutie mark won't change me No matter what I get
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,applejack,"Well, sure looks like somepony's feelin' better."
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,apple bloom,You have no idea.
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,applejack,"See, now what did I tell you? A good night's sleep cures just about everythin'."
Bloom & Gloom,Josh Haber,apple bloom,I guess so. I just wish it hadn't been so exhaustin'.
Tanks for the Memories,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,"Look at that, Tank! Cloudsdale's here! That means Ponyville is next up for winter!"
Tanks for the Memories,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,"You're doing awesome, everypony! Keep it up! We need those leaves off those trees! Once we get autumn cleared away, it'll be hello, winter!"
Tanks for the Memories,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,Was that a yawn I just saw?
Tanks for the Memories,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,"How can you be tired when the most exciting time of the year is right around the corner? And don't forget the best part <U+0096> our first winter together! Come on, wake up! Once those ponies bring in the big, fat clouds full of snowflakes, we'll have a ton of snow for our extreme sledding! [cheering] And over there, we can play horse hockey, with no shoulder or arm pads!"
Tanks for the Memories,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,"Everything's looking great, don't you think?"
Tanks for the Memories,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,Almost everything. Does Tank look alright to you?
Tanks for the Memories,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,"Well, he does seem to be moving a little slowly."
Tanks for the Memories,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,"I know, right?"
Tanks for the Memories,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,And he looks kind of sleepy...
Tanks for the Memories,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,Totally!
Tanks for the Memories,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,...just like he always does.
Tanks for the Memories,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,"Yeah, ha ha, I'm sure you're right."
Tanks for the Memories,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,Well?!
Tanks for the Memories,Cindy Morrow,fluttershy,I suppose his heartbeat could be a teensy-weensy-eensy bit slower than usual...
Tanks for the Memories,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,"Okay, so give him a vitamin or something!"
Tanks for the Memories,Cindy Morrow,fluttershy,I don't think he needs that.
Tanks for the Memories,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,"Maybe we're just staying up too late. Uh, too many Daring Do stories."
Tanks for the Memories,Cindy Morrow,fluttershy,"Oh, that's not it either."
Tanks for the Memories,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,"Well, what's wrong with him then?!"
Tanks for the Memories,Cindy Morrow,fluttershy,Nothing! He's perfectly fine.
Tanks for the Memories,Cindy Morrow,fluttershy,He's just going to hibernate.
Tanks for the Memories,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,"You do realize he's not a bear, right?"
Tanks for the Memories,Cindy Morrow,fluttershy,"[giggles] When the weather grows cold and less food is available, many animals hibernate to conserve energy. It's like taking a really long nap during winter, and then they wake up in spring. And see? Even tortoises do it! When the time comes, Tank will leave and dig into the ground."
Tanks for the Memories,Cindy Morrow,fluttershy,But don't worry. He'll reappear when the spring sun warms the ground back up.
Tanks for the Memories,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,Come on! Tortoises don't hibernate! Somepony put that picture in there as a joke.
Tanks for the Memories,Cindy Morrow,fluttershy,It's not a joke.
Tanks for the Memories,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,"Well, then your book must be wrong!"
Tanks for the Memories,Cindy Morrow,fluttershy,"Rainbow Dash, Tank needs to hibernate. It's healthy for him, just like sleeping is healthy for us."
Tanks for the Memories,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,"[short laugh] Whatever. Okay, thanks. Come on, Tank."
Tanks for the Memories,Cindy Morrow,fluttershy,Where are you going?
Tanks for the Memories,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,To get a second opinion from a real reptile expert.
Tanks for the Memories,Cindy Morrow,spike,"I told you, Rainbow Dash, I'm a dragon!"
Tanks for the Memories,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,Come on! You're practically twins!
Tanks for the Memories,Cindy Morrow,spike,I'm purple.
Tanks for the Memories,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,"But if you don't have to hibernate, why should Tank?!"
Tanks for the Memories,Cindy Morrow,spike,Because he's a tortoise and I'm a dragon!
Tanks for the Memories,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,"Same family though, right?"
Tanks for the Memories,Cindy Morrow,spike,No!
Tanks for the Memories,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,I'll take that as a yes.
Tanks for the Memories,Cindy Morrow,spike,"Ugh! Look, if Fluttershy says tortoises hibernate, then I guarantee tortoises hiber<U+0097>"
Tanks for the Memories,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,"Well, what would you know?! You're a dragon!"
Tanks for the Memories,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,"Nopony knows you like I do, Tank. All you need is some hard work to get the old blood pumping."
Tanks for the Memories,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,Come on!
Tanks for the Memories,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,"[huff] These things are heavy! Chock full of snowflakes! We're gonna have such a killer time in the snow, Tank. Tank? Tank!"
Tanks for the Memories,Cindy Morrow,pinkie pie,"Aww, look at the cute wittle Tankie, all snuggly-wuggly, getting ready to hibern<U+0097>"
Tanks for the Memories,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,Don't say that word!
Tanks for the Memories,Cindy Morrow,pinkie pie,"Which one? ""Snuggly""? ""Wuggly""? ""Tankie""? ""Hibernate""?"
Tanks for the Memories,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,That one!
Tanks for the Memories,Cindy Morrow,pinkie pie,I was just saying how cute he<U+0097>
Tanks for the Memories,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,"If you think hiber... <U+0096> you know, that napping thing <U+0096> is so cute, why don't you go do it?! Somewhere far away from here?!"
Tanks for the Memories,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,[to rest of Mane Six] What are you looking at?! Pinkie Pie and I are just having a conversation!
Tanks for the Memories,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,"Look, Rainbow Dash, we all know how upset you are about Tank hiber<U+0097>"
Tanks for the Memories,Cindy Morrow,pinkie pie,Shhhh! Don't say that word! That's what started this all!
Tanks for the Memories,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,We all know how upset you are about Tank. But you shouldn't take your anger out on your friends.
Tanks for the Memories,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,"Who said anything about anger?! I didn't say anything about anger! I'm not upset! And I am not angry! Do I look angry?! [grumbles] Come on, Tank! Let's get out of here!"
Tanks for the Memories,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,"I need you bright-eyed and bushy-tailed, not sleepy-eyed and scaly-tailed! Which... is exactly what you are. But get up anyway!"
Tanks for the Memories,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,"You can't hiber<U+0096> you know. What about all the primo things we're gonna do together this winter? Building snow ponies, starting snowball fights, sipping hot cider by the fire."
Tanks for the Memories,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,"Don't you wanna do those things with me?! Think, Rainbow Dash, think! Tank's only hibernating because it's cold, right? Well, I'd rather have him awake in the heat than asleep in the cold... [gasps] I just have to stop winter!"
Tanks for the Memories,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,Hah! Stopping winter is gonna be a breeze!
Tanks for the Memories,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,When life gives you lemons You can make lemonade But life gave me Tank here And my choice has long been made
Tanks for the Memories,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,"Ugh! For every hoof step back, they go three hoof steps forward! What are we gonna do? [long pause] Cloudsdale. That's it, Tank! If I can't stop winter in Ponyville, maybe I can stop it at the source!"
Tanks for the Memories,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,Lunch hour! Perfect!
Tanks for the Memories,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,"Slam dunk! With no water, they can't make clouds or snow! They can't make winter!"
Tanks for the Memories,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,"I hate to do this to those weather ponies, but desperate times call for desperate measures!"
Tanks for the Memories,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,Oopsies! Looks like these were a little loose!
Tanks for the Memories,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,And there goes winter down the drain!
Tanks for the Memories,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,"Uh, I can't see!"
Tanks for the Memories,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,Aaaaaah!
Tanks for the Memories,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,Let's get out of here!
Tanks for the Memories,Cindy Morrow,applejack,What in the name of Celestia's goin' on up there?
Tanks for the Memories,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,"Prepare yourselves, everypony! Winter is coming!"
Tanks for the Memories,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,"Everypony, look out!"
Tanks for the Memories,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,"[groaning] You okay, Tank?"
Tanks for the Memories,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,Rainbow Dash! Are you alright?
Tanks for the Memories,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,[sighs] No...
Tanks for the Memories,Cindy Morrow,pinkie pie,"Knock, knock!"
Tanks for the Memories,Cindy Morrow,fluttershy,"How are you feeling, Rainbow Dash?"
Tanks for the Memories,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,[despondently] Whatever...
Tanks for the Memories,Cindy Morrow,rarity,The poor thing looks so sad! Just what are we doing to do?
Tanks for the Memories,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,I don't know what we can do.
Tanks for the Memories,Cindy Morrow,applejack,"Buck up, Sugarcube. You just ain't yourself these days."
Tanks for the Memories,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,[despondently] Whatever...
Tanks for the Memories,Cindy Morrow,rarity,"Uh, how can I say this tactfully...? You've lost your sparkle, Rainbow Dash."
Tanks for the Memories,Cindy Morrow,pinkie pie,"I hate to say this, but, well... you've become...! [hushed] A party pooper!"
Tanks for the Memories,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,"Didn't you hear me? I said 'whatever'. I don't know if you're here to cheer me up or what, but I'm fine."
Tanks for the Memories,Cindy Morrow,fluttershy,"Let me handle this. Rainbow Dash, your winter is going to be pet-less."
Tanks for the Memories,Cindy Morrow,rarity,Whatever did you do that for?!
Tanks for the Memories,Cindy Morrow,fluttershy,Because she'll never get past this until she lets it all out.
Tanks for the Memories,Cindy Morrow,applejack,[awkwardly] Uh... it's okay. Tank'll come back in a few months.
Tanks for the Memories,Cindy Morrow,applejack,"Alright, alright. There, there. [hushed, to Fluttershy] Nice going, Fluttershy. How do we get her to stop?"
Tanks for the Memories,Cindy Morrow,fluttershy,[hushed] She's got to be about done by now. Can't be too much left in there.
Tanks for the Memories,Cindy Morrow,fluttershy,Feeling better?
Tanks for the Memories,Cindy Morrow,rarity,[starts crying] I can't bear to see Fluttershy cry!
Tanks for the Memories,Cindy Morrow,pinkie pie,[starts crying] It's just heart-wrenching!
Tanks for the Memories,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,[to Applejack] You too?!
Tanks for the Memories,Cindy Morrow,applejack,"Nope, I'm good."
Tanks for the Memories,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,"Look, everypony, I know how hard it is to say goodbye<U+0097>"
Tanks for the Memories,Cindy Morrow,pinkie pie,[crying] I'm mostly sad because you're not sad!
Tanks for the Memories,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,What?! Me?! What about Applejack?
Tanks for the Memories,Cindy Morrow,pinkie pie,"[crying] Applejack cries on the inside, Twilight!"
Tanks for the Memories,Cindy Morrow,applejack,It's true.
Tanks for the Memories,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,"[settling down] It's alright, Fluttershy. It's alright."
Tanks for the Memories,Cindy Morrow,applejack,[hushed] You think she's done or just getting a third wind?
Tanks for the Memories,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,I don't know... Rainbow Dash? Are you okay?
Tanks for the Memories,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,"[sniffling] I think so. I feel better. Really, I do. Thanks, everypony. I don't know what I'd do without you. [tearing up] Or him... [sniffs] Oh, Tank... I'm sure gonna miss you."
Tanks for the Memories,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,"Well, guess we're starting winter with a bang."
Tanks for the Memories,Cindy Morrow,applejack,The fun's come early! Yee-haw!
Tanks for the Memories,Cindy Morrow,pinkie pie,You think we could mess up winter every year? It's way less work!
Tanks for the Memories,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,"Uh, I don't think Rainbow Dash could handle it."
Tanks for the Memories,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,Riding that entire season from Cloudsdale to Ponyville was pretty awesome.
Tanks for the Memories,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,I thought you guys might like to say goodbye to Tank. He's ready to hibernate.
Tanks for the Memories,Cindy Morrow,pinkie pie,"Ooh, you're using the word! Oh, she's using the word! And when Tank finishes hibernating, I'm gonna throw him the biggest welcome home party ever! Or wait. Should it be a 'welcome above ground' party? Or a 'happy wake-up' party? Maybe an 'it's about time!' party!"
Tanks for the Memories,Cindy Morrow,rarity,"And I'll design him a very special suit just for the occasion, whichever one it ends up being."
Tanks for the Memories,Cindy Morrow,applejack,"I'm glad you're feelin' a little better, Rainbow Dash."
Tanks for the Memories,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,"Yeah, me too."
Tanks for the Memories,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,"So, you really wanna do this hibernating thing, huh?"
Tanks for the Memories,Cindy Morrow,rarity,"Goodbye, Tank."
Tanks for the Memories,Cindy Morrow,fluttershy,Happy winter.
Tanks for the Memories,Cindy Morrow,applejack,"See you later, little feller."
Tanks for the Memories,Cindy Morrow,pinkie pie,"Have a good sleep, Tank!"
Tanks for the Memories,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,"Goodbye, Tank! We'll miss you!"
Tanks for the Memories,Cindy Morrow,twilight sparkle,Well? Ready for some winter fun?
Tanks for the Memories,Cindy Morrow,rainbow dash,"Uh, I'm gonna hang here and read to him a bit. That little guy can never get to sleep without a bedtime story. I'll be right there."
Appleoosa's Most Wanted,Dave Polsky,apple bloom,Aren't you glad y'all came with me to see Applejack compete in the Appleloosa rodeo?
Appleoosa's Most Wanted,Dave Polsky,scootaloo,Totally! This place is a cutie mark gold mine! There's barrel racing...
Appleoosa's Most Wanted,Dave Polsky,scootaloo,"...roping contests, rodeo clowning..."
Appleoosa's Most Wanted,Dave Polsky,scootaloo,...steeplechase...!
Appleoosa's Most Wanted,Dave Polsky,apple bloom,"If we can get into some of these events, we could all three walk off the train back in Ponyville with brand spankin' new cutie marks!"
Appleoosa's Most Wanted,Dave Polsky,scootaloo,Wouldn't a barrel look good here?
Appleoosa's Most Wanted,Dave Polsky,apple bloom,I want a lasso!
Appleoosa's Most Wanted,Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,"I don't know... All these events look a little, well, dangerous."
Appleoosa's Most Wanted,Dave Polsky,apple bloom,"No risk, no reward."
Appleoosa's Most Wanted,Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,I hope nothing bad is going on.
Appleoosa's Most Wanted,Dave Polsky,apple bloom,A cutie mark-apalooza and a low-down varmint? This is shapin' up to be the most excitin' rodeo ever!
Appleoosa's Most Wanted,Dave Polsky,scootaloo,"Yeah, come on!"
Appleoosa's Most Wanted,Dave Polsky,braeburn,"Woo-hoo! Yee-haw! That's my cousin! Go, Applejack, go!"
Appleoosa's Most Wanted,Dave Polsky,applejack,Whew! It's been a dog's age since I got to compete. All the rodeos 'round Ponyville are closed down for some reason.
Appleoosa's Most Wanted,Dave Polsky,braeburn,"Well, I guess havin' injured kinfolk in Appleloosa sure paid off then, huh, cuz?"
Appleoosa's Most Wanted,Dave Polsky,applejack,"Just doin' my best to fill your horseshoes, Braeburn."
Appleoosa's Most Wanted,Dave Polsky,braeburn,Keep tossin' like that and I'll be out of a job!
Appleoosa's Most Wanted,Dave Polsky,braeburn,"Ow, ow!"
Appleoosa's Most Wanted,Dave Polsky,applejack,"Ooh, sorry. Say, where's my sister and her friends?"
Appleoosa's Most Wanted,Dave Polsky,braeburn,"Uh-oh. Gee, uh, I guess I got so caught up watchin' you that I<U+0097>"
Appleoosa's Most Wanted,Dave Polsky,applejack,You said you'd keep an eye on those fillies! How am I supposed to focus on practicin' if you're not gonna<U+0097>
Appleoosa's Most Wanted,Dave Polsky,braeburn,"There they are! Heh, right where I left 'em... Aw, don't be mad! [beat] Owwwwch! My foreleg! Hurts so much...!"
Appleoosa's Most Wanted,Dave Polsky,applejack,"Y'all can't go runnin' off like that, y'hear? Backstage at a rodeo ain't no kind of playground!"
Appleoosa's Most Wanted,Dave Polsky,apple bloom,"Sorry, Applejack. We won't wander off again. But, uh, speakin' of the rodeo... what would you say about me and the Crusaders maybe competin' in one teensy-weensy little event or three?"
Appleoosa's Most Wanted,Dave Polsky,braeburn,Look out!
Appleoosa's Most Wanted,Dave Polsky,applejack,[gasps] What the hay just happened?
Appleoosa's Most Wanted,Dave Polsky,braeburn,You fillies alright?
Appleoosa's Most Wanted,Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,[simultaneously] Yeah...
Appleoosa's Most Wanted,Dave Polsky,applejack,"What is it, Sheriff?"
Appleoosa's Most Wanted,Dave Polsky,braeburn,Is it him?
Appleoosa's Most Wanted,Dave Polsky,apple bloom,Don't send us home! It's not fair!
Appleoosa's Most Wanted,Dave Polsky,applejack,"Now, quit yer bellyachin'. I can't have y'all around here with some outlaw on the loose. Aw, maybe I oughta call it quits and go home too."
Appleoosa's Most Wanted,Dave Polsky,braeburn,"No, you can't! This rodeo is important to Appleloosa! And with you in there, we got a real shot at winnin'! Come on, now, you head on back to practice and don't worry none about these three. I won't let 'em outta my sight."
Appleoosa's Most Wanted,Dave Polsky,braeburn,[to Crusaders] Ya hear? Y'all ain't leavin' my sight!
Appleoosa's Most Wanted,Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,I thought we weren't going to wander off again.
Appleoosa's Most Wanted,Dave Polsky,apple bloom,This ain't wanderin'. We know exactly where we're headed <U+0096> to find Trouble Shoes!
Appleoosa's Most Wanted,Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,But isn't he a dangerous criminal?
Appleoosa's Most Wanted,Dave Polsky,apple bloom,We only need to find him. We don't need to capture him. The sheriff can handle that!
Appleoosa's Most Wanted,Dave Polsky,scootaloo,"And once he's in jail, we'll be competing! And then it's..."
Appleoosa's Most Wanted,Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,Worst idea ever.
Appleoosa's Most Wanted,Dave Polsky,apple bloom,It's another giant hoof print!
Appleoosa's Most Wanted,Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,Do either of you have any idea where we are?
Appleoosa's Most Wanted,Dave Polsky,scootaloo,"Uh, maybe we should head back and try again later."
Appleoosa's Most Wanted,Dave Polsky,apple bloom,"C'mon, before we lose the trail!"
Appleoosa's Most Wanted,Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,"Come on, we've gone far enough! It's time to go back!"
Appleoosa's Most Wanted,Dave Polsky,scootaloo,"The rain is only getting worse, Apple Bloom! Let's come back tomorrow."
Appleoosa's Most Wanted,Dave Polsky,apple bloom,"Maybe y'all are right. So, how do we get back?"
Appleoosa's Most Wanted,Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,You mean you don't know?!
Appleoosa's Most Wanted,Dave Polsky,applejack,"Whew! Good job, y'all. I know they need lots of mud for the rodeo tomorrow, but I wish they would've warned us about this rainstorm."
Appleoosa's Most Wanted,Dave Polsky,applejack,Braeburn? Where are the girls?
Appleoosa's Most Wanted,Dave Polsky,applejack,[echoing] What?!
Appleoosa's Most Wanted,Dave Polsky,applejack,Sheriff Silverstar! You gotta help! My sister's gone! And her friends too!
Appleoosa's Most Wanted,Dave Polsky,braeburn,"I've searched and searched, but no sign of 'em anywhere!"
Appleoosa's Most Wanted,Dave Polsky,applejack,It must've been Trouble Shoes!
Appleoosa's Most Wanted,Dave Polsky,applejack,You really wanna take that chance?
Appleoosa's Most Wanted,Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,"You sure about this, Scootaloo?"
Appleoosa's Most Wanted,Dave Polsky,scootaloo,"I thought I was, but now I'm not."
Appleoosa's Most Wanted,Dave Polsky,apple bloom,So I pretty much got us completely and totally lost. How could this get any worse?
Appleoosa's Most Wanted,Dave Polsky,apple bloom,We gotta get out of this rain. There's no tellin' how long this storm could last.
Appleoosa's Most Wanted,Dave Polsky,scootaloo,Look!
Appleoosa's Most Wanted,Dave Polsky,apple bloom,It looks abandoned. Let's go see if we can find some blankets or somethin'.
Appleoosa's Most Wanted,Dave Polsky,apple bloom,[through tinnitus] Hello? You alright?
Appleoosa's Most Wanted,Dave Polsky,trouble shoes,Surely.
Appleoosa's Most Wanted,Dave Polsky,apple bloom,We didn't mean no harm. We just came in to get out of the rain.
Appleoosa's Most Wanted,Dave Polsky,trouble shoes,Had some hot cider a-cookin' in the kitchen. Doubt it survived.
Appleoosa's Most Wanted,Dave Polsky,trouble shoes,"I ain't gonna rise to greet y'all. Awfully rude, I reckon, but as you can see, I'm the fresh casualty of an unusually unfortunate circumstance. My lot in life, I suppose."
Appleoosa's Most Wanted,Dave Polsky,apple bloom,Are you... Trouble Shoes?
Appleoosa's Most Wanted,Dave Polsky,trouble shoes,That's me.
Appleoosa's Most Wanted,Dave Polsky,scootaloo,W-what are you doing?
Appleoosa's Most Wanted,Dave Polsky,apple bloom,I'm gonna unwrap him.
Appleoosa's Most Wanted,Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,You can't do that! That's Trouble Shoes!
Appleoosa's Most Wanted,Dave Polsky,apple bloom,"Aw, he don't seem so bad."
Appleoosa's Most Wanted,Dave Polsky,trouble shoes,Of course guests would arrive while I ain't got no pie to offer. Scores more misfortune points for old Trouble Shoes. Wh-whooaaa!
Appleoosa's Most Wanted,Dave Polsky,trouble shoes,Typical. Bad luck never rests.
Appleoosa's Most Wanted,Dave Polsky,apple bloom,"You sure that's bad luck? Seems like maybe you're just a little, um..."
Appleoosa's Most Wanted,Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,Klutzy?
Appleoosa's Most Wanted,Dave Polsky,trouble shoes,Tell that to the flank! Upside-down horseshoe <U+0096> bad luck. Follows me wherever I go like sour on old milk. Y'all best vamoose before my bad luck rubs off and sticks to y'all. Get along! Skedaddle!
Appleoosa's Most Wanted,Dave Polsky,trouble shoes,Am-scray!
Appleoosa's Most Wanted,Dave Polsky,scootaloo,"Um, we don't really know the way back to Appleloosa..."
Appleoosa's Most Wanted,Dave Polsky,trouble shoes,But o' course I do. Wouldn't you know it? My lucky day.
Appleoosa's Most Wanted,Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,It's actually kind of sweet of him to help us out like this.
Appleoosa's Most Wanted,Dave Polsky,scootaloo,"I know! What do we do if he takes us back to Appleloosa and the sheriff arrests him? If I get a cutie mark for that, I'll feel guilty every time I see it."
Appleoosa's Most Wanted,Dave Polsky,apple bloom,"Say there, Trouble Shoes, you might not want to take us all the way back to Appleloosa. The sheriff sort of has it in his mind that you're a no-good outlaw lookin' to shut down the rodeo."
Appleoosa's Most Wanted,Dave Polsky,trouble shoes,My kind of luck he'd think that.
Appleoosa's Most Wanted,Dave Polsky,apple bloom,But... is it true?
Appleoosa's Most Wanted,Dave Polsky,trouble shoes,Y'all like stories?
Appleoosa's Most Wanted,Dave Polsky,cutie mark crusaders,Mm-hmm!
Appleoosa's Most Wanted,Dave Polsky,trouble shoes,"Just my luck. I was hopin' you'd say no. [narrating flashback] When I was a colt, I wanted to be a rodeo star somethin' fierce, but I just didn't seem to have the knack for it."
Appleoosa's Most Wanted,Dave Polsky,trouble shoes,[narrating] I practiced and practiced...
Appleoosa's Most Wanted,Dave Polsky,trouble shoes,"[narrating] And finally, I wrangled up the guts to audition for rodeo school. Right in the middle of that tryout, I knew I was doin' what I was meant to. And wouldn't you know it? In a flash comes this here cutie mark."
Appleoosa's Most Wanted,Dave Polsky,trouble shoes,"[narrating] I can still remember them judges a-laughin'. Didn't even finish my routine 'cause right then I knew bad luck was my fate. That fire for rodeo never did leave me, though. Couldn't keep away from 'em. So I'd sneak down and have a look, and wouldn't you know it? Bad luck would strike again. Just my lot in life, I reckon..."
Appleoosa's Most Wanted,Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,Poor Trouble Shoes. I can't believe those mean judges would laugh at him like that.
Appleoosa's Most Wanted,Dave Polsky,apple bloom,Don't you see? They weren't laughin' at him. They were just enjoyin' the show.
Appleoosa's Most Wanted,Dave Polsky,scootaloo,What are you saying?
Appleoosa's Most Wanted,Dave Polsky,apple bloom,"Think about it. If we saw a rodeo clown doin' what he did back in that shack, we'd think he was the greatest!"
Appleoosa's Most Wanted,Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,"You're right! He could still be in rodeos, just not the way he thought!"
Appleoosa's Most Wanted,Dave Polsky,scootaloo,"So he's been looking at his cutie mark wrong the whole time! It's not bad luck, it's<U+0097>"
Appleoosa's Most Wanted,Dave Polsky,trouble shoes,Just my luck.
Appleoosa's Most Wanted,Dave Polsky,apple bloom,Wait!
Appleoosa's Most Wanted,Dave Polsky,applejack,Braeburn? Get these fillies someplace safe.
Appleoosa's Most Wanted,Dave Polsky,apple bloom,"Wait, no! Listen, Applejack!"
Appleoosa's Most Wanted,Dave Polsky,cutie mark crusaders,No!
Appleoosa's Most Wanted,Dave Polsky,apple bloom,But Trouble Shoes isn't the menace everypony thinks!
Appleoosa's Most Wanted,Dave Polsky,applejack,"Sakes alive, what's with you? Why in tarnation would you want me to help get him out of jail when he's the one who ran off with y'all to begin with?! Now if y'all excuse me, I'm off to win the Appleloosa rodeo hay bale monster stack."
Appleoosa's Most Wanted,Dave Polsky,apple bloom,"Um, Applejack?"
Appleoosa's Most Wanted,Dave Polsky,trouble shoes,"[sighs] Well, at least I get me a view of one small corner of the rodeo."
Appleoosa's Most Wanted,Dave Polsky,trouble shoes,Figures.
Appleoosa's Most Wanted,Dave Polsky,apple bloom,"Come on, sheriff! You're about to miss the hay bale monster stack!"
Appleoosa's Most Wanted,Dave Polsky,apple bloom,"Let's go, Trouble Shoes! This here's a jailbreak!"
Appleoosa's Most Wanted,Dave Polsky,trouble shoes,Ain't no need. Can hear the rodeo just fine from this vantage.
Appleoosa's Most Wanted,Dave Polsky,scootaloo,But we've got a plan to help you live your dream!
Appleoosa's Most Wanted,Dave Polsky,trouble shoes,"Listen, y'all, I'm a known criminal. How you proposin' on gettin' me into a rodeo?"
Appleoosa's Most Wanted,Dave Polsky,apple bloom,"Go, Applejack!"
Appleoosa's Most Wanted,Dave Polsky,scootaloo,[simultaneously] You can do it!
Appleoosa's Most Wanted,Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,[simultaneously] Woo-hoo!
Appleoosa's Most Wanted,Dave Polsky,trouble shoes,"Well, how do I look?"
Appleoosa's Most Wanted,Dave Polsky,trouble shoes,"Come on now, stack them bales! Woo-hoo!"
Appleoosa's Most Wanted,Dave Polsky,apple bloom,That's my sister!
Appleoosa's Most Wanted,Dave Polsky,apple bloom,"'Kay now, Trouble Shoes, you're on!"
Appleoosa's Most Wanted,Dave Polsky,trouble shoes,"Say what?! I may be dressed like one, but I ain't no rodeo clown."
Appleoosa's Most Wanted,Dave Polsky,apple bloom,"You got your cutie mark all wrong, Trouble Shoes! You were born to entertain! You've got a gift for makin' folks laugh, don't you?"
Appleoosa's Most Wanted,Dave Polsky,trouble shoes,"But my cutie mark's an upside-down horseshoe, and that means bad luck."
Appleoosa's Most Wanted,Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,That all depends on how you look at it.
Appleoosa's Most Wanted,Dave Polsky,apple bloom,"You always wanted to be a part of the rodeo, right? Well, now's your chance. Go on!"
Appleoosa's Most Wanted,Dave Polsky,trouble shoes,Whoa!
Appleoosa's Most Wanted,Dave Polsky,applejack,"There y'all are! How 'bout your big sis, huh?"
Appleoosa's Most Wanted,Dave Polsky,apple bloom,"[flatly] Yeah, way to go."
Appleoosa's Most Wanted,Dave Polsky,applejack,Since when are y'all so into rodeo clowns?
Appleoosa's Most Wanted,Dave Polsky,trouble shoes,"Just leave me be, cutie mark! I aim to clear that there hoop!"
Appleoosa's Most Wanted,Dave Polsky,applejack,What the hay?!
Appleoosa's Most Wanted,Dave Polsky,apple bloom,"Wait, y'all! He ain't what you think he is!"
Appleoosa's Most Wanted,Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,But he never wanted to ruin any rodeos! Those were just bad accidents!
Appleoosa's Most Wanted,Dave Polsky,applejack,"Sweetie Belle, what are you talkin' about?"
Appleoosa's Most Wanted,Dave Polsky,scootaloo,Trouble Shoes has a gift for making ponies laugh! He's maybe the best rodeo clown I've ever seen!
Appleoosa's Most Wanted,Dave Polsky,apple bloom,"He thought his cutie mark was telling him to keep away from rodeos, but deep inside he knew it's where he was meant to be. He just didn't know how to do it."
Appleoosa's Most Wanted,Dave Polsky,trouble shoes,"What she says is true. This here entertainin' y'all with my klutzin'? That's what I was supposed to be doin'. I know it now. I didn't mean no harm, honest! I just ain't never loved nothin' like I love the rodeo, so I kept on sneakin' back and makin' a big old mess of things. Turns out I was just a-lookin' at my cutie mark all wrong."
Appleoosa's Most Wanted,Dave Polsky,trouble shoes,"If I done wrong, I'll see to it that I take my medicine and square my accounts."
Appleoosa's Most Wanted,Dave Polsky,apple bloom,"Uh, yeah, about that..."
Appleoosa's Most Wanted,Dave Polsky,apple bloom,[sighs] You really want us to clean up all this mess Trouble Shoes made?
Appleoosa's Most Wanted,Dave Polsky,applejack,Maybe it'll teach you not to go wanderin' off after I say not to!
Appleoosa's Most Wanted,Dave Polsky,apple bloom,"Ugh. Ain't it bad enough that you get to go back to Ponyville with a shiny trophy, and all we're bringing back is these same old blank flanks?"
Appleoosa's Most Wanted,Dave Polsky,applejack,Y'all helped Trouble Shoes realize what his cutie mark really means. Ain't that a nice feelin' you can take back with you?
Appleoosa's Most Wanted,Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,I guess we did make things a little better.
Appleoosa's Most Wanted,Dave Polsky,scootaloo,It does feel kinda nice.
Appleoosa's Most Wanted,Dave Polsky,apple bloom,So... we can stop now?
Appleoosa's Most Wanted,Dave Polsky,applejack,Nnope.
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Natasha Levinger,discord,"Ohoho, but that's not all! When I went to look for them again, they were on the ceiling!"
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Natasha Levinger,fluttershy,"[laughs] Oh, Discord, I've never known anypony as funny as you! I love that story about the time you tried to train your right paw... [giggles] ...to fetch your left leg! [giggles] Oh, I do love our Tuesday teas, and I can't wait for you to meet my friend Tree Hugger. She's going to love you too."
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Natasha Levinger,fluttershy,I met her on a trip to see the Breezies. She's a member of the Equestrian Society for the Preservation of Rare Creatures.
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Natasha Levinger,fluttershy,We're all gonna have so much fun together at the Grand Galloping Gala!
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Natasha Levinger,discord,"Oh, I was wondering when you were going to ask me. I'd love to."
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Natasha Levinger,fluttershy,"Oh. Oh, no. Um, I'm afraid I've already asked Tree Hugger. I'm sorry, Discord. I assumed you'd have your own ticket since you and Princess Celestia are friends now. Were you not invited?"
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Natasha Levinger,discord,"Who, me? It probably got lost in the mail. No biggie, as the foals say. Well, gotta go!"
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Natasha Levinger,fluttershy,But we haven't had any of our Tuesday teacakes.
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Natasha Levinger,discord,"Well, I guess we're just going to have to exclude them from our party this time. Oh, did I say that out loud? I mean, ta-ta."
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Natasha Levinger,spike,[snoring] Gemstones... [snoring] Gah!
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Natasha Levinger,discord,Where's Twilight?
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Natasha Levinger,spike,"Uh, she's in Canterlot, helping Princess Celestia with the Gala!"
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Natasha Levinger,rarity,"Oh, your first Grand Galloping Gala! The excitement, the anticipation! I wouldn't miss this for all the jewels in Equestria!"
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Natasha Levinger,rainbow dash,Hey!
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Natasha Levinger,discord,"I don't suppose that, uh, these adorable little cutie pies have their own tickets to the Gross Gruesome Gala, do they?"
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Natasha Levinger,rarity,"Ahem! To answer your rather rude question, they're going as our dates, our plus-ones."
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Natasha Levinger,sweetie belle,[singsong] We're plus-ones!
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Natasha Levinger,cutie mark crusaders,[singsong] We're plus ones! We're plus-ones!
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Natasha Levinger,discord,"Yes, yes, yes, I believe I got that!"
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Natasha Levinger,rainbow dash,Yeah!
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Natasha Levinger,pinkie pie,"Have a wonderful, special, fantastic day! Oh, hi, Discord. Want some cake?"
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Natasha Levinger,pinkie pie,"I can give you a list of all the flavors we have in order of most delicious to incredibly, unbelievably delicious!"
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Natasha Levinger,discord,"Actually, Pinkie Pie, who are you taking to... I mean, do you... eugh, oh, you know what? I am famished. I'll take all the cakes."
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Natasha Levinger,pinkie pie,All of them?! He wants all of the cakes!
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Natasha Levinger,discord,"Well, I'll need all my energy when I'm dancing at the Gala, if I decide to go that is. Oh, by the way, are you bringing anypony?"
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Natasha Levinger,pinkie pie,"Oh, of course! I was gonna ask my mom, because she's, you know, my mom, but it turned out she didn't want to go, so I started asking around and around and around, and I couldn't think of anypony, and I was about to just go by myself, and I realized, of course! Who loves fancy exciting affairs more than anypony else? My sister Maud!"
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Natasha Levinger,discord,You know what? Cancel my order.
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Natasha Levinger,pinkie pie,You want none of the cakes now?!
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Natasha Levinger,fluttershy,"[laughing] Oh, my, you are funny!"
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Natasha Levinger,discord,I guess every being in Equestria is funny today.
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Natasha Levinger,fluttershy,"Oh, how rude of me. Tree Hugger, this is Discord. Discord, Tree Hugger."
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Natasha Levinger,discord,My vibe?
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Natasha Levinger,fluttershy,It's a compliment.
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Natasha Levinger,discord,"Oh, well, I'm sure it is. Well, I must be off."
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Natasha Levinger,discord,Have fun at the Gala!
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Natasha Levinger,discord,"""Oh, Tree Hugger. You're such a great friend. So much funnier than unfunny old Discord!"""
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Natasha Levinger,discord,"""No, no, here. Take my plus-one. I insist. Before somepony else thinks he's my friend and expects to be asked instead. What's that? You're worried Discord might be upset?"" Not a problem! I can make more new friends anytime I want. It's not as if any of this actually mattered! I don't even want to go to the Gala anyway!"
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Natasha Levinger,discord,Are you perhaps looking for me?
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Natasha Levinger,discord,My ticket to the Grand Galloping Gala! I was invited after all!
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Natasha Levinger,discord,[grimly] Why is this so late?
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Natasha Levinger,princess celestia,"I must say, it's been very nice having you take over some of the planning responsibilities for this year's Gala."
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Natasha Levinger,twilight sparkle,Anything I can do to make it easier on you.
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Natasha Levinger,princess celestia,"Thank you, Twilight. I am quite looking forward to just enjoying the Gala for once."
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Natasha Levinger,discord,"Good evening, everypony! What a glorious affair!"
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Natasha Levinger,discord,"He does have a yen for shiny things, the rascal."
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Natasha Levinger,twilight sparkle,I'll take care of this.
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Natasha Levinger,twilight sparkle,[hushed] What are you doing here with... that?!
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Natasha Levinger,discord,"Now, now, now. The Smooze may be an ""it"", but it's an it with a heart of, well, blob."
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Natasha Levinger,twilight sparkle,"This night is extremely important to me, Discord. [through gritted teeth] Keep it under control!"
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Natasha Levinger,discord,"Yes, yes, yes, of course. Tell me, have you seen Fluttershy anywhere?"
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Natasha Levinger,cutie mark crusaders,We're here! We're here! We made it to the Gala!
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Natasha Levinger,fluttershy,Wow.
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Natasha Levinger,discord,"Oh, Fluttershy. I didn't see you there."
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Natasha Levinger,fluttershy,How did you even know to look for an aura on a waterfall?
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Natasha Levinger,fluttershy,Discord! I thought you weren't coming!
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Natasha Levinger,discord,"No. I actually never said that. But funny how you remembered it that way. Anyway, good to see you. Tree Friend, is it? Your name is slipping my mind right now. How strange."
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Natasha Levinger,discord,You've gotta be kidding. You don't remember me?
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Natasha Levinger,discord,"Yes, well, as I was saying, it's just great to be here with my oldest, bestest friend."
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Natasha Levinger,fluttershy,"Am I really your oldest, bestest friend?"
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Natasha Levinger,discord,"You? [laughs] Of course not! You think I don't have other friends? I'm centuries old! I was talking about the Smooze! Smooze Face, the Smoozinator <U+0096> well, I mean that's what we called him back in college. Smooze! I would like you to meet Fluttershy and, um, hmm... Tree... how'd you say it... Tree Embrace?"
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Natasha Levinger,fluttershy,[giggles] I can't believe I've never heard you speak of the Smooze before. Sounds like you two are so close.
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Natasha Levinger,discord,"Well, I'm glad you got that, because that's what is true. We are."
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Natasha Levinger,discord,Very close.
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Natasha Levinger,fluttershy,That's wonderful! The four of us should go out to dinner sometime!
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Natasha Levinger,discord,We should all go out to dinner sometime?! Have you no heart?
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Natasha Levinger,discord,"Oh, oh! It looks like somepony wants to mingle. We'll be back in a bit."
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Natasha Levinger,fluttershy,"Oh, okay. Treezie and I would love to talk to you more later!"
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Natasha Levinger,discord,"Treezie? Really? Sort of a juvenile nickname, don't you think?"
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Natasha Levinger,discord,Smoozie! Wait up!
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Natasha Levinger,discord,"Now, listen, Smooze. I need to make this a party of one for a little while. Just stay out here until I come for you."
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Natasha Levinger,discord,Exactly!
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Natasha Levinger,rainbow dash,Uhh... I think we're gonna go hit the dance floor.
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Natasha Levinger,discord,"Fluttershy, tell the Hugs here about the time that we went to the store and came back with two cakes instead of one, because that's how crazy we are when we're together."
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Natasha Levinger,fluttershy,"Um, we went to the store and bought two cakes."
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Natasha Levinger,discord,"Oh. Well, you kind of left out all the fun and frivolity there. But I'm sure you got it, Tree Hugger."
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Natasha Levinger,discord,We like each other. That was the point! I'm actually pretty lukewarm about cake.
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Natasha Levinger,rarity,[muffled screaming] Let me in!
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Natasha Levinger,rarity,[gasps for breath] That creature took my jewels!
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Natasha Levinger,twilight sparkle,Discord! I thought I told you to keep your friend under control!
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Natasha Levinger,discord,"Oh, please. I have better things to do than to watch that thing all night. [laughs nervously] What I mean to say is, that thing is a dear, dear friend, and I'll make sure that the ooze, uh, that he can't help but secrete doesn't get on anypony else."
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Natasha Levinger,twilight sparkle,"Thank you. It's alright, everypony. Let's just get back to enjoying this magical evening!"
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Natasha Levinger,discord,[to the Smooze] You are making me look like a fool in front of Fluttershy. I'll be back when the Gala is over.
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Natasha Levinger,fluttershy,"[laughing] Oh, Tree Hugger, I've never known anypony as funny as you!"
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Natasha Levinger,discord,"Check, check, check. Is this thing on? Good evening, fillies and germs! I just flew into Canterlot, and wow, are my interspecies parts tired!"
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Natasha Levinger,discord,"I've only got these tiny mismatched wings, and even I can fly better than Twilight Sparkle! Am I right? Pchoo!"
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Natasha Levinger,twilight sparkle,Hey!
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Natasha Levinger,discord,"[laughs nervously] Uh, well, perhaps you're into more observational humor."
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Natasha Levinger,discord,Did you ever notice how you always materialize out of thin air? Why not thick air? What's the deal there?
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Natasha Levinger,discord,Tough crowd.
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Natasha Levinger,twilight sparkle,What is he doing?!
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Natasha Levinger,rainbow dash,I think they're... jokes?
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Natasha Levinger,pinkie pie,Maud! Jokes!
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Natasha Levinger,maud pie,My favorite.
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Natasha Levinger,discord,[muffled and out of focus] You might be a Ponyville pony when an ordinary night on the town ends in a lesson about friendship! [in focus] Knock knock!
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Natasha Levinger,discord,"You're supposed to say ""Who's there?""! This is the most basic of jokes!"
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Natasha Levinger,maud pie,You're the most basic of jokes.
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Natasha Levinger,pinkie pie,"Good one, Maud!"
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Natasha Levinger,twilight sparkle,What is that?!
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Natasha Levinger,twilight sparkle,None of my magic works on this ooze! Can you stop it?
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Natasha Levinger,princess celestia,I'm afraid not!
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Natasha Levinger,twilight sparkle,"Discord, how could you bring him here?!"
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Natasha Levinger,discord,"Oh, he's not that bad!"
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Natasha Levinger,rarity,"Oh, my shoes will be ruined forever!"
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Natasha Levinger,applejack,That's what you're worried about? Really?
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Natasha Levinger,discord,"Isn't it, though? And to think, it would never have happened had I come to the Gala as somepony else's plus-one."
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Natasha Levinger,discord,You don't know anything about rare creatures. I've known Smooze Face for ages. He's not agitated. He's partying down! Whoo!
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Natasha Levinger,discord,Do you even know what you just said?
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Natasha Levinger,sweetie belle,It worked!
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Natasha Levinger,rainbow dash,"Way to go, Tree Hugger!"
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Natasha Levinger,fluttershy,That was the most magical thing I've ever seen done with animals!
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Natasha Levinger,discord,"Stop it! Stop it! That's it! I'm done with you, Tree Hugger!"
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Natasha Levinger,discord,A skosh? A skosh?!
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Natasha Levinger,discord,Relax. I'm not going to hurt you. I'm simply going to send you to another dimension. I can't have you interfering in my relationship with Fluttershy anymore!
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Natasha Levinger,fluttershy,"Discord, stop!"
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Natasha Levinger,twilight sparkle,"Don't worry, Fluttershy! We'll stop him!"
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Natasha Levinger,discord,"I'm doing her a favor, Fluttershy! It's a lovely dimension! White sand beaches, attentive wait staff... I mean, okay, the humidity isn't great, but where isn't that the case these days?"
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Natasha Levinger,fluttershy,I don't understand why you're doing this! We were all getting along so well!
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Natasha Levinger,discord,"As well as we could, considering you've already stomped all over our friendship by inviting her to the biggest night of the year as if I didn't matter at all!"
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Natasha Levinger,fluttershy,Did you really think I'd abandon you just because I have a new friend?!
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Natasha Levinger,discord,"Yes, because that's what you did!"
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Natasha Levinger,fluttershy,"No, Discord! I invited a friend to a party! I didn't abandon you! What if you had a friend that you could discuss chaos-based magic with? Would that mean we weren't friends anymore?!"
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Natasha Levinger,discord,"Uh... [stuttering] No, I suppose not. It would just mean that I'd have different friends for different things... Oh, oh, dear, it looks like I've perhaps overreacted just a skosh."
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Natasha Levinger,fluttershy,"More like a lot of skoshes! Tree Hugger, could you give us a minute?"
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Natasha Levinger,discord,I'm just so new at this whole friendship thing. It's so much more complicated than it looks.
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Natasha Levinger,fluttershy,Do you think maybe you owe somepony an apology? Not me!
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Natasha Levinger,discord,"Er, Tree Hugger, I'm sorry that you got caught in the middle of my... er, you know... wrath."
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Natasha Levinger,discord,"Oh, your chakras. [laughs nervously] Fair enough."
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Natasha Levinger,discord,"I owe you an apology, Smooze. I spent the whole evening thinking about my own feelings and never thinking about yours."
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Natasha Levinger,discord,"Well, friends! I think I may actually grow to like this multiple-friend thing."
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Natasha Levinger,maud pie,I like it too.
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Natasha Levinger,pinkie pie,"Hey, it's not a party until somepony spreads magic-resistant ooze uncontrollably over the ballroom! [squee] Come on, Smoozinator! Let's dance!"
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Natasha Levinger,twilight sparkle,"I'm sorry, Princess Celestia. I thought I could give you a break tonight, but it turns out I was in over my head."
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Natasha Levinger,princess celestia,You have nothing to apologize for. This has been the most fun Gala in years!
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Natasha Levinger,twilight sparkle,"I know, it was a<U+0097>What?! But there was ooze all over the place! And one of the guests threatened to send somepony to another dimension!"
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Natasha Levinger,princess celestia,I know! Can you imagine how dull it would have been if I hadn't invited Discord? Come on! Whoo! The night is still young!
The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"La, la-la, la-la! La, la-la, la-la, la la-la la-la! This is gonna be so great, Gummy! We have absolutely nothing to do today except bake! I've been waiting for just the right time to finally try Granny Pie's super-special triple-chocolate, fifteen-layer marjolaine recipe! It's gonna be amazing!"
The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"Let's see. Nutty meringue, chocolate ganache, praline and nuts, cocoa-flavored buttercream..."
The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,An hour per layer <U+0096> that's fifteen hours of pure baking bliss!
The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"Okay, Gummy, I think we're ready to start prepping the second layer!"
The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"Oh, my gosh! My cutie mark! [gasps] You know what this means?! [hushed] The map!"
The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"Uh, Gummy? Could you take over for a bit? Hopefully this'll be quick. I'll just measure the baking powder for you... [squee] ...and when the first layer cools, you can drizzle some of the ganache over it. And don't forget to beat the egg whites for the meringue!"
The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"This is so exciting. The map is summoning you to Griffonstone, the very heart of the griffon kingdom! I don't know if either of you have read ""Bygone Griffons of Greatness"", but griffons were known to be<U+0097>"
The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,"Rude, insensitive bullies?"
The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,You mean Gilda?
The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,"Yeah, I mean Gilda! When she came to Ponyville, she was a total jerk to all my friends, especially Pinkie Pie!"
The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,She was a bit of a party pooper.
The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,Mm-hmm.
The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"So, maybe Gilda was a little rude. You still get to go to Griffonstone, and according to this book, it has a rich, fascinating history! [narrating] In ancient times, griffons were known to be as greedy as dragons, always hoarding their bits and other treasures. But all that changed when King Grover found the mysterious golden Idol of Boreas. Legend says the Idol of Boreas was made from the dust of golden sunsets, blown across the mountains by the north winds. Possessing the Idol of Boreas filled the griffons' hearts with pride. It's said that that one great treasure is responsible for turning Griffonstone into the most majestic kingdom of all the land."
The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,And why do you care so much about griffons anyway?
The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"It was actually Gilda's visit that made me curious. So I picked up ""Bygone Griffons of Greatness"", and I've been hooked ever since! And now... [sigh] Now you two get to see Griffonstone with your very own eyes."
The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,Huh? Just me and Rainbow Dash?
The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,"Hey, you can totally take my place if you want. [yawn] I still have half a nap to finish."
The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"Why don't you just come with us? I mean, you are the Princess of Friendship."
The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"No, no, if the map wanted me to go to the coolest kingdom in all of Equestria and tour the palace and see the actual idol that unites an entire species, which would be super amazing, I'm sure it would've said so. You two can handle whatever the issue is just fine. I'll stay here and do important princessy things. I guess."
The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"Well then, come on, Dashie! We're going to Griffonstone!"
The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,[sigh] Fine...
The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"Whatcha reading, Rainbow?"
The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,[sighs] Twilight literally wrote a book on what we need to do in Griffonstone.
The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,You mean like a guide on how to figure out what problem we're supposed to fix?
The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,"And then some. It's like Twilight herself in book form. [imitating Twilight] ""Always carry plenty of bits. The griffons are sure to help you as long as you share the wealth."""
The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"[swallows] Uh, can I borrow some bits?"
The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"[voiceover] Upon arriving in Griffon Gorge, be sure to pause and cast your eyes northerly, up the Hyperborean Mountains, taking in the breathtaking beauty of Griffonstone. Once in Griffonstone proper, go immediately to the palace and introduce yourself to the king. ""Bygone Griffons of Greatness"" was written a long time ago, and it ends with the coronation of the fourteenth king of the griffons, King Guto. I have no idea who's in charge now. Tell the king you've been sent by the Princess of Friendship, and you're there to help with some sort of problem. If for some reason the king can't help, I'd try the Griffonstone library next. It's a little known secret that if you befriend a librarian, you can usually find out anything. Plus, as a bonus, there's a statue of King Grover outside! [giggles] Photo op! And don't forget to sample some famous griffon scones. They're supposed to be the best."
The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"Aw, Twilight should've come along! Then she could see first-hoof that Griffonstone is..."
The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,...a total dump!
The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,Ugh. Maybe the map should've called Rarity instead of us.
The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"Excuse me, sir? This is Griffonstone, right?"
The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"Well, that wasn't very nice."
The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,See? These griffons are exactly like I'd thought they'd be.
The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,Maybe we should just find the palace so we can ask the king what's going on.
The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone,Amy Keating Rogers,gilda,"We don't have a king, losers."
The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,"Hello, Gilda."
The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone,Amy Keating Rogers,gilda,Dash.
The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,Pinkie!
The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,What are you doing here?
The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone,Amy Keating Rogers,gilda,"Uh, I'm a griffon? What's your excuse, dweebs?"
The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,Hey! These 'dweebs' are here to help Griffonstone!
The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone,Amy Keating Rogers,gilda,Help it what?
The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"Well... we're not really sure! But it involves a map and our cutie marks and a problem, and<U+0097>"
The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone,Amy Keating Rogers,gilda,Bored now!
The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"Well if you don't have a king, could you at least tell us where the Idol of Boreas is?"
The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone,Amy Keating Rogers,gilda,Ha-ha! Don't tell me you really believe in that thing.
The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone,Amy Keating Rogers,gilda,"Oh, great. Now you got Grampa Gruff started!"
The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,[tearing up] That was the saddest story ever!
The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,No wonder Twilight's book ended with the coronation of King Guto. Who would want to record a history that sad?
The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone,Amy Keating Rogers,gilda,It's not sad! Do we look sad to you?
The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,"Pinkie, I think I know why the map sent us here. We need to find the Idol of Boreas and bring glory and pride back to Griffonstone!"
The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone,Amy Keating Rogers,gilda,"Ha-ha. Here we go <U+0096> typical pony hero complex. None of us care about that dumb old idol. Don't you get it? We don't care about anything, and that's the way we like it!"
The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,I think Rainbow Dash is right! The map sent us here to fix some sort of problem!
The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone,Amy Keating Rogers,gilda,The only problem Griffonstone has is you!
The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,"Well, I don't care what she says. We're gonna find that treasure, make Griffonstone cool again, and get back to Ponyville! Come on!"
The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"Wait, Rainbow Dash. What about Twilight's advice?"
The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,"What, taking a bunch of pictures?"
The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,She mentioned finding answers at the library.
The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,"Knock yourself out. But when you get bored with Twilight's tour book, I'll be at the Abysmal Abyss finding the Idol of Boreas."
The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,I'm here to find your missing idol and save Griffonstone!
The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,"Uh, I'll need some rope, a grappling hook, and a guide to take me down to the Abysmal Abyss."
The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"Hey, Gilda! Word on the street is that Griffonstone has an amazing library chock-full of answers!"
The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone,Amy Keating Rogers,gilda,Word on what street?
The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"Okay, maybe not this street, but on other streets, your library is the talk of the town."
The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone,Amy Keating Rogers,gilda,"The library's right there, so why don't you go inside and leave me alone?!"
The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"[gasps] Maybe it's good that Twilight didn't come... [to statue] It's sad what happened to your town, King, but Rainbow Dash can't be right. This can't all be because of a missing hunk of gold. [as King Grover] You are right, Pinkie! And you've got amazing hair! [normal] Aw, King Grover, you old charmer!"
The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,[gasps] I know what Griffonstone needs!
The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone,Amy Keating Rogers,gilda,Fewer ponies?
The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone,Amy Keating Rogers,gilda,Can't sing here!
The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,But how do you break into uplifting musical numbers with no singing?
The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone,Amy Keating Rogers,gilda,"Yeah, that's Griffonstone's biggest problem <U+0096> lack of uplifting musical numbers."
The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"Well if I can't sing, how about a party? If there's one thing these griffons need, it's a good cheer! Where's your party store?"
The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"No party store? Uh, how about cake? Nothing cheers folks up like cake! Where's a bakery?"
The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone,Amy Keating Rogers,gilda,Ugh.
The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"No singing, no party store, no bakery?! What is this place?!"
The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone,Amy Keating Rogers,gilda,You're welcome to leave [suddenly yelling] at any time!
The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"Well, that just takes the cake. Wait, no! It can't take the cake 'cause there is no cake! Or muffins! Or griffon scones!"
The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone,Amy Keating Rogers,gilda,"Oh, we got griffon scones. That's my specialty."
The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone,Amy Keating Rogers,gilda,Bits first!
The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone,Amy Keating Rogers,gilda,Well?
The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone,Amy Keating Rogers,gilda,"What, you like it? That's my Grampa Gruff's secret recipe."
The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,[with mouth full] Ow! I think I broke a tooth!
The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone,Amy Keating Rogers,gilda,"Well, whatever. No refunds. I don't even care anyway. I just want to sell enough of these so that I can leave this lousy town."
The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,[spits] I can help you with that!
The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,"Uh, you think you could tighten the strap on my helmet?"
The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,"[sighs] Never mind, I got it. So how deep is this abyss?"
The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,Don't you griffons ever talk about anything but bits?
The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,No wonder Gilda's such a delight.
The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"[chewing] Grampa Gruff's recipe is good, but it's missing one important ingredient."
The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone,Amy Keating Rogers,gilda,"Don't tell me. ""Friendship""?"
The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"Uh, no. Baking powder. Lucky for you, I never leave home without it! Now just pop those in the oven, and you'll have griffon scones worth their weight in gold!"
The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone,Amy Keating Rogers,gilda,Greta!
The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"Aha! I saw that, Gilda! You may act like a gruff, grumbling griffon, but inside you're gracious and great!"
The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone,Amy Keating Rogers,gilda,What are you talking about?
The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,You just helped your friend up when she got knocked down.
The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone,Amy Keating Rogers,gilda,"What, her? Greta's just some griffon I know. We don't have friends here! [sighs] I did have a friend once, but you saw how that turned out."
The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"[poink!] [slide whistle noise] Oh, my gosh, I gotta go find Rainbow Dash!"
The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone,Amy Keating Rogers,gilda,See ya.
The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,"[shouting] You sure we can't just fly down? Whoa! Never mind, totally got my answer there."
The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,Just gotta find that golden idol and get out of this place.
The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,[screaming] Whoooa!
The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,"Ow, ooh! My hoof! Help! Throw me another rope!"
The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,[in distance] There you are! Forget about finding the idol! I figured out how to solve Griffonstone's real problem <U+0096> scones!
The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,"Pinkie Pie, you get back here!"
The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,[in distance] Yeah?
The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,[in distance] Can you throw down a rope or something?
The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,[in distance] Lemme look!
The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,One rope coming up!
The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,We need help. Don't go anywhere!
The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,[sighs] Where does she think I'm gonna go?
The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,[panicked noises] I hope I don't go anywhere!
The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"Rainbow Dash is stuck on a ledge in the Abysmal Abyss, and I need your help to save her!"
The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone,Amy Keating Rogers,gilda,Not my problem.
The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,Of course it's your problem! She's your friend!
The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone,Amy Keating Rogers,gilda,Used to be.
The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,Can't you remember when she was?
The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone,Amy Keating Rogers,gilda,Yeah. Of course.
The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone,Amy Keating Rogers,young rainbow dash,"Maybe she just doesn't want to make you look bad! Hey there, I'm Rainbow Dash! And you are...?"
The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone,Amy Keating Rogers,young rainbow dash,"You sure about that? Stick with me, Gilda, and those guys won't give you any more guff. Whoa! You're awesome!"
The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone,Amy Keating Rogers,young rainbow dash,"Well, Gilda, let's show these guys how it's done!"
The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone,Amy Keating Rogers,young rainbow dash,"Skybound soars and daring dives,"
The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone,Amy Keating Rogers,gilda,Fine. I'll help her. But that doesn't make me her friend.
The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,Duly noted. [to the audience] Except it does!
The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone,Amy Keating Rogers,gilda,"Hang on, loser! I'm coming!"
The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,"What took you so long, doofus?!"
The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,Rainbow Dash! I'm coming for you!
The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,Gotcha!
The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,I'm slipping!
The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,The idol!
The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone,Amy Keating Rogers,gilda,You're more important to me than some dumb chunk of gold.
The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"Hugging later, climbing now!"
The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone,Amy Keating Rogers,gilda,I'm really sorry about how I treated you two.
The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,"Thanks, Gilda."
The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,Apology accepted.
The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,And I'm just sorry we didn't get your idol back. Now we'll never be able to solve Griffonstone's problem.
The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,That's what I was trying to tell you! The map didn't send us here to find the lost Idol of Boreas. It sent us here to replace it with something better!
The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone,Amy Keating Rogers,gilda,Nothing's better than gold to a griffon.
The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"That's because you don't have friendship! If you can learn to care about each other again, Griffonstone could be a mightier kingdom than it ever was before! And you don't need some golden idol to do that. You just need each other."
The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,"Whoa, Pinkie. That was... really sappy."
The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"Eh, what can I say? That's how I roll. Go on, Gilda! Go make a friend!"
The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,"I don't know, Pinkie. You really think these griffons are up for this? We aren't exactly in Ponyville, you know."
The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone,Amy Keating Rogers,gilda,"Okay, so she was really weirded out until I gave her the scone. Then she tried it and said it tasted good! That's the first nice thing anygriffon's ever said to me!"
The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,"Whoa, Pinkie. I guess that really was the problem we needed to solve."
The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,"Well, we'd better be heading home."
The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone,Amy Keating Rogers,gilda,What? Y-Y-You want me to spread friendship here by myself?! How am I supposed to do that?! I haven't even made one single friend yet!
The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,"No, you haven't. You've made two."
The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,[tearing up] Hugging! Hugging now!
The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone,Amy Keating Rogers,gilda,"But you'll come back and visit, right?"
The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,Just try and stop us!
The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"[to statue] See ya later, you old charmer."
The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,"Uh, Pinkie? Who are you talking to?"
The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"Nopony! Come on, let's go home and see how Gummy did with Granny Pie's marjolaine recipe!"
Slice of Life,M. A. Larson,cranky doodle donkey,"I'll never understand the ponies in this town! Everywhere I went, they were all gussied up and lookin' at me funny! Kept asking if I was ""nervous""!"
Slice of Life,M. A. Larson,matilda,Did they forget the wedding is tomorrow?
Slice of Life,M. A. Larson,cranky doodle donkey,"Oh, maybe they're just as excited for us to be married as I am."
Slice of Life,M. A. Larson,matilda,"Well, they're going to feel awfully silly when they realize they've got the wrong date. [gasps] The invitations are wrong! This says the wedding is today!"
Slice of Life,M. A. Larson,cranky doodle donkey,But I got such a good deal on them...
Slice of Life,M. A. Larson,matilda,Everypony in town got these! The princesses have even RSVP'd!
Slice of Life,M. A. Larson,cranky doodle donkey,I told you we should have eloped!
Slice of Life,M. A. Larson,matilda,"Oh, dear. The caterer, the flowers, the musicians! We've got to move it all to today!"
Slice of Life,M. A. Larson,cranky doodle donkey,What?!
Slice of Life,M. A. Larson,matilda,Where's my wedding planner?!
Slice of Life,M. A. Larson,derpy,Muffin?
Slice of Life,M. A. Larson,derpy,"I really messed up on those invitations! I feel just awful, Doc!"
Slice of Life,M. A. Larson,derpy,"I told Cranky I could get 'em printed for cheap, but that meant hiring somepony with no experience using a printing press."
Slice of Life,M. A. Larson,derpy,"Oh, I wish there was a way I could go back in time and fix all this."
Slice of Life,M. A. Larson,derpy,Like these? They're pretty.
Slice of Life,M. A. Larson,derpy,How did you learn to make all this stuff anyway?
Slice of Life,M. A. Larson,derpy,Yeah. Oh! Because I accidentally sent out invitations for Cranky and Matilda's wedding with today's date instead of tomorrow's!
Slice of Life,M. A. Larson,apple bloom,"The way they're huddled up like that, I'd say it's either a friendship problem or a monster attack."
Slice of Life,M. A. Larson,sweetie belle,"Maybe it's just a friendship problem, and it'll all be cleared up in half an hour or so."
Slice of Life,M. A. Larson,matilda,Where's Pinkie Pie?! I need my wedding planner!
Slice of Life,M. A. Larson,matilda,"Oh, no! On my wedding day?! Somepony's gotta help me! You!"
Slice of Life,M. A. Larson,matilda,I need to move an entire wedding from tomorrow to today!
Slice of Life,M. A. Larson,matilda,So you'll do it?
Slice of Life,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,Whoa!
Slice of Life,M. A. Larson,matilda,Come on! We better get to the salon before that monster flattens it!
Slice of Life,M. A. Larson,derpy,What am I gonna do? [gasp] Matilda! I feel so bad about the invitations! Is there anything I can do<U+0097>
Slice of Life,M. A. Larson,matilda,FLOWERS!
Slice of Life,M. A. Larson,derpy,So there's no way you can do it?
Slice of Life,M. A. Larson,derpy,Okay. Thanks anyway.
Slice of Life,M. A. Larson,sweetie drops,"I have to admit, when Matilda said we needed this place ready by today, I was a little nervous."
Slice of Life,M. A. Larson,sweetie drops,"There is nothing like a best friend, is there?"
Slice of Life,M. A. Larson,sweetie drops,What was that?
Slice of Life,M. A. Larson,sweetie drops,What is it this time? A creature from the Everfree Forest?
Slice of Life,M. A. Larson,sweetie drops,Did you say bugbear? It found me!
Slice of Life,M. A. Larson,sweetie drops,"My name isn't Bon Bon. It's ""Special Agent Sweetie Drops"". I work for a super-secret anti-monster agency in Canterlot, or at least I did until the bugbear went missing from Tartarus a few years back."
Slice of Life,M. A. Larson,sweetie drops,"When it escaped, we had to shutter the whole agency. Every last shred of evidence of the organization's existence was destroyed. Celestia demanded complete deniability."
Slice of Life,M. A. Larson,sweetie drops,"It was me who captured the bugbear. I had to go deep cover here in Ponyville and assume the name Bon Bon. I never thought it'd be able to track me, but now it has."
Slice of Life,M. A. Larson,sweetie drops,"I'm sorry, Lyra! I couldn't tell you for your own protection!"
Slice of Life,M. A. Larson,sweetie drops,It was all real. You're my very best friend.
Slice of Life,M. A. Larson,sweetie drops,I've got to go find a crowd to blend into before I put you in danger! I'll see you at the wedding.
Slice of Life,M. A. Larson,cranky doodle donkey,"I need my ring today, no matter the cost! ...As long as it doesn't cost any extra."
Slice of Life,M. A. Larson,derpy,Doc! I've finally figured out how I can help! Your flameless fireworks look just like flowers! I'll use them for the wedding!
Slice of Life,M. A. Larson,matilda,"Oh, there are so many things I'm forgetting! I hope Cranky remembers to tell the musicians! Oh! Oh! I'll never get my mane done in time!"
Slice of Life,M. A. Larson,matilda,You do?
Slice of Life,M. A. Larson,matilda,You're Steven Magnet?
Slice of Life,M. A. Larson,matilda,...You're Steven Magnet.
Slice of Life,M. A. Larson,matilda,"I'm sorry, Steven. I guess I assumed you were a pony. And I had no idea you had such adventures together."
Slice of Life,M. A. Larson,matilda,Really?
Slice of Life,M. A. Larson,matilda,"He is the sweetest thing, isn't he? All the stress I've put myself through. All the stress I've put him through. The only thing that matters is that we're together. The wedding isn't the important thing <U+0096> the marriage is."
Slice of Life,M. A. Larson,princess celestia,[hushed] What do you mean you left it on the counter?!
Slice of Life,M. A. Larson,princess luna,[hushed] I thought you were bringing it!
Slice of Life,M. A. Larson,princess celestia,"[hushed] [groans] Well, this is just wonderful!"
Slice of Life,M. A. Larson,princess luna,"[hushed] I handled the gift for Cadance and Shining Armor! You were supposed to do this one, remember?"
Slice of Life,M. A. Larson,princess celestia,"[hushed] Well, we can't just come to this wedding empty-hoofed!"
Slice of Life,M. A. Larson,princess cadance,[sighs] It's alright. He always cries at weddings.
Slice of Life,M. A. Larson,princess cadance,...Usually it's not until the wedding starts.
Slice of Life,M. A. Larson,sweetie drops,"Attention, everypony! Our friends have done it! They've defeated the bugbear!"
Slice of Life,M. A. Larson,sweetie drops,[to Lyra] Hey.
Slice of Life,M. A. Larson,sweetie drops,"So, uh, you didn't happen to mention our earlier conversation about my [hushed through gritted teeth] secret identity [normal] to anypony, did you?"
Slice of Life,M. A. Larson,sweetie drops,[laughs] That's what best friends are for.
Slice of Life,M. A. Larson,princess celestia,"[hushed] Next time, you can just bring your own gift, and I'll bring mine."
Slice of Life,M. A. Larson,princess luna,[hushed] Fine.
Slice of Life,M. A. Larson,derpy,Like a million bits!
Slice of Life,M. A. Larson,cranky doodle donkey,I can't believe I lost my hair! I look ridiculous. The love of my life deserves better than this!
Slice of Life,M. A. Larson,cranky doodle donkey,"Aw, thanks, buddy."
Slice of Life,M. A. Larson,mayor mare,"Well, is everypony here?"
Slice of Life,M. A. Larson,derpy,"All set, Mayor!"
Slice of Life,M. A. Larson,mayor mare,"Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today to join these two in mare-trimony. As I look around this room, I can only imagine how uncomfortable Cranky must be."
Slice of Life,M. A. Larson,mayor mare,"But I also see so many ponies from all trots of life, brought together by love. Cranky searched all across this great land of ours to find Matilda, and no matter what obstacles kept them apart, love would finally bring them together, just as it has brought all of us together now. It's remarkable to me how a story like Cranky's search for Matilda could fill this room with such a unique collection of ponies! It makes you realize that everypony is the star of their own story. And it's not just the main characters in our stories that make life so rich! It's everypony <U+0096> those who play big parts and those who play small. If it weren't for everypony in this room and many more who couldn't be here today, Cranky and Matilda's lives wouldn't be as full and vibrant as they are."
Slice of Life,M. A. Larson,mayor mare,"And so, in front of all these loved ones... Cranky, do you take this donkey to be your lawfully wedded wife?"
Slice of Life,M. A. Larson,cranky doodle donkey,You bet I do!
Slice of Life,M. A. Larson,mayor mare,"And do you, Matilda, take this donkey to be your lawfully wedded husband?"
Slice of Life,M. A. Larson,matilda,[tearing up] I do!
Slice of Life,M. A. Larson,mayor mare,"Then I'm proud to say, I now pronounce you jack and jenny!"
Slice of Life,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"You know something, girls? We are so lucky to live in this town. I love you all!"
Slice of Life,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,Ow! That's where the bugbear bit me!
Slice of Life,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,Sorry!
Princess Spike,Neal Dusedau; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,princess luna,Welcome to the Grand Equestria Pony Summit!
Princess Spike,Neal Dusedau; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,princess celestia,"You delegates have traveled far and wide to represent your cities as we seek to celebrate and learn from all the unique places that make up our wonderful land of Equestria. At tonight's welcome reception, Princess Cadance will dedicate this beautiful friendship statue made up of gemstones from each of your home cities."
Princess Spike,Neal Dusedau; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,princess celestia,Now I'd like to turn things over to the one who organized the summit: Princess Twilight Sparkle!
Princess Spike,Neal Dusedau; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,twilight sparkle,"[tired] Thank you, everypony. With delegates from over fifty cities attending three days of conferences, receptions, and meetings, this is the largest Grand Equestria Pony Summit yet. And let me tell you, putting it all together has led to more than one sleepless night. We're so excited to have you here and to learn more about life all across this great land of ours."
Princess Spike,Neal Dusedau; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,twilight sparkle,And now my faithful assistant Spike would like to say a few words.
Princess Spike,Neal Dusedau; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,spike,"Um, hello, everypony! I'm here to help any way I can. So if there's anything I can do for any of you<U+0097>"
Princess Spike,Neal Dusedau; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,spike,[sighs] I guess everypony loves a princess. Hmph.
Princess Spike,Neal Dusedau; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,spike,Ugh!
Princess Spike,Neal Dusedau; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,princess cadance,Spike!
Princess Spike,Neal Dusedau; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,princess cadance,Spike?
Princess Spike,Neal Dusedau; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,spike,[muffled] A little help?
Princess Spike,Neal Dusedau; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,princess cadance,"Spike, we need you!"
Princess Spike,Neal Dusedau; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,spike,Of course! What can I do?
Princess Spike,Neal Dusedau; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,spike,"Whoa, what happened to you?"
Princess Spike,Neal Dusedau; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,princess cadance,She's been awake three straight days preparing for the summit. We need to make sure she gets some rest today. She'll never be able to attend the welcome reception in this condition. Can I count on you to see to it that she isn't disturbed?
Princess Spike,Neal Dusedau; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,spike,I promise! I won't let you down!
Princess Spike,Neal Dusedau; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,spike,Perfect.
Princess Spike,Neal Dusedau; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,spike,Not on my watch.
Princess Spike,Neal Dusedau; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,spike,"Uh, excuse me? Can you keep it down a little? Oh, no!"
Princess Spike,Neal Dusedau; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,spike,I'll give you birdseed! Worms! Anything! Just please stop singing before you wake the princess!
Princess Spike,Neal Dusedau; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,spike,Huh. I can't believe that worked.
Princess Spike,Neal Dusedau; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,spike,Hyah!
Princess Spike,Neal Dusedau; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,spike,"[sighs] Uh, hi fellas. Sorry to break up your game, but there's sort of an important diplomatic summit kind of thingy going on, and it involves a princess needing to sleep, and, uh... maybe you could move your game somewhere else?"
Princess Spike,Neal Dusedau; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,spike,[strained] Can't you just wait a few hours?
Princess Spike,Neal Dusedau; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,spike,Huh. Good thing I've got the princesses on my side.
Princess Spike,Neal Dusedau; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,spike,"[vibrating yelps] Aw, come on! Excuse me? [shouting] Excuse me, sir! I really need you to<U+0097> [jackhammer stops] <U+0097>stop right now! Oops."
Princess Spike,Neal Dusedau; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,spike,"Ugh, you couldn't do this yesterday?!"
Princess Spike,Neal Dusedau; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,spike,"But there is no summit without Princess Twilight, and she needs things to be kept quiet around here. So if you don't mind, I'd<U+0097>"
Princess Spike,Neal Dusedau; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,spike,"Uh, hi. Can I help you?"
Princess Spike,Neal Dusedau; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,spike,"Uh, can you talk a little quieter? And maybe come back later?"
Princess Spike,Neal Dusedau; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,spike,[sighs] Lemme see what I can do.
Princess Spike,Neal Dusedau; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,twilight sparkle,[snoring] Huh?
Princess Spike,Neal Dusedau; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,twilight sparkle,Does something need scheduling?
Princess Spike,Neal Dusedau; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,spike,"Oh, uh, yeah. Two delegates have speeches booked in the same hall. What do I do?"
Princess Spike,Neal Dusedau; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,twilight sparkle,"Okay, no problem. Just put the hay in the apple and eat the candle, hm?"
Princess Spike,Neal Dusedau; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,spike,Huh?
Princess Spike,Neal Dusedau; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,spike,"Oh, I need an answer, but Twilight can't even think straight! Oh, my gosh, what am I supposed to do?!"
Princess Spike,Neal Dusedau; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,spike,"Um, she said that... Well, she said that she... she wants you to... share it?"
Princess Spike,Neal Dusedau; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,spike,Huh? B-but<U+0097>
Princess Spike,Neal Dusedau; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,spike,"Your friend took your seat? Hah, big deal! Why don't you just<U+0097>"
Princess Spike,Neal Dusedau; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,spike,[sighs] Fine.
Princess Spike,Neal Dusedau; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,spike,Uh...
Princess Spike,Neal Dusedau; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,spike,The princess says no friendship should end over a seat. You should forgive your friend!
Princess Spike,Neal Dusedau; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,spike,I could tell these delegates anything as long as they think it came from Twilight. [beat] Alright! Who's next?
Princess Spike,Neal Dusedau; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,spike,"So, how can Princess Twilight be of service?"
Princess Spike,Neal Dusedau; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,fancy pants,"Well, as host city, the Canterlot delegation feels it's only right that we should get passes to every meeting and party, yes?"
Princess Spike,Neal Dusedau; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,spike,"Well, that doesn't seem fair<U+0097>I mean, Princess Twilight doesn't think that seems fair."
Princess Spike,Neal Dusedau; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,fancy pants,"Ehhh... yes, yes, very well. It was worth a try though, wasn't it, old chap, hm?"
Princess Spike,Neal Dusedau; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,spike,This is great! I just took care of a whole bunch of stuff that Twilight won't have to worry about when she wakes up! Wonder if anypony else needs the princess's help?
Princess Spike,Neal Dusedau; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,spike,"If I can check a few of these meetings off Twilight's schedule, then when she wakes up, she won't have to think about anything but the reception."
Princess Spike,Neal Dusedau; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,spike,"Uh, it says here you have a meeting with Princess Twilight?"
Princess Spike,Neal Dusedau; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,spike,"Okay, go ahead."
Princess Spike,Neal Dusedau; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,spike,"Well, if it helps, you can call me ""Princess Spike"". No-no-no, it's alright. The princess asked me to take care of a few things for her. That's why I came to find you."
Princess Spike,Neal Dusedau; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,spike,The princess says so!
Princess Spike,Neal Dusedau; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,spike,I'm here for your two o'clock!
Princess Spike,Neal Dusedau; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,spike,I speak for the Princess.
Princess Spike,Neal Dusedau; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,spike,"Actually, Twilight still needs her rest, and her no-noise policy is still in effect for a few more hours. Sorry."
Princess Spike,Neal Dusedau; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,princess cadance,"Hey, Spike. What's going on?"
Princess Spike,Neal Dusedau; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,spike,"Oh, you know, just settin' 'em up and knockin' 'em down!"
Princess Spike,Neal Dusedau; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,princess cadance,What do you mean?
Princess Spike,Neal Dusedau; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,spike,"Not only have I kept things quiet so Twilight could sleep, I also took care of all her afternoon meetings so she won't have to worry about them when she wakes up."
Princess Spike,Neal Dusedau; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,princess cadance,Are you sure she'd want you doing that? There are so many things to keep track of at this summit.
Princess Spike,Neal Dusedau; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,spike,"Nah, don't worry. I got it covered. I know Twilight so well, it's easy to make decisions like her!"
Princess Spike,Neal Dusedau; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,princess cadance,"Oh, okay. Well, thank you for keeping Twilight's stress level down. As long as that's the real reason you're doing it."
Princess Spike,Neal Dusedau; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,spike,"Well, why else would I be doing it?"
Princess Spike,Neal Dusedau; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,princess cadance,You're not enjoying speaking for Twilight a little bit?
Princess Spike,Neal Dusedau; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,spike,[sighs] [vibrating] By order of the princess.
Princess Spike,Neal Dusedau; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,spike,[through gritted teeth] By order of the princess...!
Princess Spike,Neal Dusedau; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,princess cadance,"It sure is, but it's also hard work, isn't it?"
Princess Spike,Neal Dusedau; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,spike,"Eh, it's not so bad."
Princess Spike,Neal Dusedau; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,princess cadance,"Spike, I'm concerned you might be abusing your relationship with Twilight."
Princess Spike,Neal Dusedau; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,spike,"What are you talking about? I'm a great princess<U+0097>I mean, Twilight's a great princess! And I've been working hard to help her! When two delegates had a falling out, I'm the one who fixed their friendship! I listened to that pony drone on about gems for forty-five minutes so Twilight wouldn't have to! I moved a polo match away from the tower so she could sleep! And I didn't even eat that delicious looking statue! I'm a decision-making master!"
Princess Spike,Neal Dusedau; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,spike,[sighs] Okay. So maybe I did get a little carried away making decisions. But it's not like anything bad happened.
Princess Spike,Neal Dusedau; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,spike,This is unexpected!
Princess Spike,Neal Dusedau; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,princess cadance,I'll go shut off the main! You get rid of the water!
Princess Spike,Neal Dusedau; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,spike,"Oh, bless me..."
Princess Spike,Neal Dusedau; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,fancy pants,"Oh, my! What is the meaning of this?!"
Princess Spike,Neal Dusedau; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,spike,"Well, uh, you see, there was this polo game, and<U+0097>"
Princess Spike,Neal Dusedau; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,fancy pants,How could you let a water main burst on Canterlot's most important day?!
Princess Spike,Neal Dusedau; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,fancy pants,"Well, what about these trees?! I ordered them trimmed to avoid just such a situation!"
Princess Spike,Neal Dusedau; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,fancy pants,Why would the princess make such horrible decisions?! This all could have been prevented!
Princess Spike,Neal Dusedau; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,spike,"Please, everypony, listen! I'm so sorry all this happened!"
Princess Spike,Neal Dusedau; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,fancy pants,What are you apologizing for? These were Princess Twilight's awful decisions!
Princess Spike,Neal Dusedau; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,fancy pants,"I'll not let Princess Twilight give Canterlot a bad name in the eyes of Equestria! Come on, everypony! Let's go give her a piece of our minds!"
Princess Spike,Neal Dusedau; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,spike,Please! You've got it all wrong!
Princess Spike,Neal Dusedau; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,spike,"[panting] Wait! I mean, [hushed] wait!"
Princess Spike,Neal Dusedau; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,fancy pants,What is it now?! There's an angry mob here that demands satisfaction!
Princess Spike,Neal Dusedau; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,spike,"It's just that, uh, we don't want to wake the princess, do we?"
Princess Spike,Neal Dusedau; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,fancy pants,"[muffled] Princess, we must speak at once!"
Princess Spike,Neal Dusedau; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,spike,She is SLEEPING!
Princess Spike,Neal Dusedau; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,twilight sparkle,"[yawns] I'm glad you're here, Spike. We've got a lot to do! Do you know if the water main was fixed?"
Princess Spike,Neal Dusedau; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,spike,"Uh, you seem well-rested."
Princess Spike,Neal Dusedau; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,twilight sparkle,I haven't slept like that since I was a filly!
Princess Spike,Neal Dusedau; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,spike,"You haven't? Well, at least I got one thing right. And it was the one thing Cadance asked of me. Maybe I did do a good job today!"
Princess Spike,Neal Dusedau; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,twilight sparkle,"Fancy Pants, what's wrong?"
Princess Spike,Neal Dusedau; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,fancy pants,"Don't play games with me, Princess! You know why I'm here!"
Princess Spike,Neal Dusedau; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,twilight sparkle,Is this about the special privileges you wanted? Because this seems a little extreme!
Princess Spike,Neal Dusedau; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,fancy pants,The special privileges?! The last thing on my mind is special privileges!
Princess Spike,Neal Dusedau; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,twilight sparkle,"What's going on, Spike?"
Princess Spike,Neal Dusedau; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,spike,"Um... you needed to sleep. And Princess Cadance told me you weren't to be disturbed. And there was this bird, and, well... long story short, I made a few decisions on your behalf."
Princess Spike,Neal Dusedau; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,twilight sparkle,A few decisions?!
Princess Spike,Neal Dusedau; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,spike,"Well, maybe more than a few, but I had good intentions! Honest! Until I... didn't anymore. I'm sorry, Twilight. I guess I got a little carried away. It-it just felt so good to have ponies caring about my opinions on such important matters. I guess I was just enjoying feeling like a princess."
Princess Spike,Neal Dusedau; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,twilight sparkle,"Well, Spike, one of the most important things a princess can do is realize when she's made a mistake and fix it."
Princess Spike,Neal Dusedau; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,spike,How do I do that?
Princess Spike,Neal Dusedau; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,princess cadance,You could start with them.
Princess Spike,Neal Dusedau; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,spike,"[sighs] Uh, hi there, everypony. So I guess I owe you all a pretty big apology. It's funny. Here we are at a summit that brings together ponies from all across Equestria, and all I could think about was myself. You all came here to celebrate the things that make each of our cities so unique and special. But instead of getting into the spirit of things like all of you, I used my friend's position to make myself feel good."
Princess Spike,Neal Dusedau; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,fancy pants,"The Canterlot ruby goes here, old sport."
Princess Spike,Neal Dusedau; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,spike,Does this mean you forgive me?
Princess Spike,Neal Dusedau; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,fancy pants,Quite. Just like how all our cities make up the beautiful land of Equestria!
Princess Spike,Neal Dusedau; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,princess cadance,"I hereby dedicate the Citizens of Equestria statue to everypony who plays their part, no matter how big or how small!"
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,twilight sparkle,You look nervous. There's no reason to be nervous. Nothing to worry about. Everything's gonna be fine!
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,pinkie pie,"Twilight, tell those butterflies in your tummy to beat it! Making new friends is always fun."
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,twilight sparkle,Ohhhh...
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,fluttershy,They're probably just as nervous as you are.
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,applejack,You've been plannin' this shindig for weeks. You know everything about these fellers. It's gonna be dandy.
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,twilight sparkle,"[inhales] [exhales] You're right. Remember, Equestria and Yakyakistan haven't opened their borders for hundreds of moons. In fact, Yakyakistan is so far north of the Crystal Mountains, nopony's even been there! Imagine the look on Princess Celestia's face when she finds out we made friends with a yak prince! [nervous laugh] I'm calm! I'm calm..."
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,prince rutherford,"Ponies! Greetings, ponies!"
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,twilight sparkle,"Prince Rutherford, your Majesty. On behalf of all of us, I welcome you to Equestria."
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,prince rutherford,Me honored. Yaks hope for great friendship between ponies and yaks. [echoing] Friends for a thousand moons!
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,twilight sparkle,You must be hungry after a long journey.
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,twilight sparkle,We've prepared a banquet of traditional yak foods.
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,prince rutherford,"If things not perfect, yaks get mad. Yaks always get mad when things not perfect!"
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,prince rutherford,[sniffs] [chewing] [spits] This no taste like yak food! Fake pony food make yaks mad!
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,pinkie pie,Is it okay to be nervous now?
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,applejack,"Them yaks sure have a funny way of sayin' ""howdy."""
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,rarity,"They're different, that's all. Very... different."
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,rainbow dash,"I think they broke my record for most stuff broken in under a minute. I mean, they even broke the trophy."
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,twilight sparkle,"All we have to do is show them how great it can be to have friends before Princess Celestia arrives for the friendship party tonight. Now, who read the seven-volume cross-indexed history of Yakyakistan I recommended?"
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,rainbow dash,Um... I-I had a thing...
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,applejack,"Pretty sure that's what fur's always for, Pinkie Pie."
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,pinkie pie,I know! Yaks are so cool!
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,twilight sparkle,"Pinkie Pie, can you show them around town? I know you have to plan the friendship party too, but it would really help make them feel welcome."
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,pinkie pie,Don't worry. They'll be in good hooves with me.
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,twilight sparkle,"Remember, we want to make sure Equestria feels like home. That means doing everything we can to make this place feel like Yakyakistan."
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,pinkie pie,No problem!
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,twilight sparkle,Good. Let's get out there and make some new friends!
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,applejack,"We know y'all are noble warriors who avoid the so-called finer things, so me and my family would be honored if you rested here in the barn during your visit."
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,pinkie pie,Applejack and I made hay beds like you're used to back in Yakyakistan.
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,prince rutherford,Hmm... This perfect.
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,pinkie pie,"You can snooze here all afternoon, 'cause you're gonna need a lot of energy for my party tonight!"
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,applejack,[sighs] That wasn't so hard.
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,prince rutherford,Wait! This not yak hay!
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,pinkie pie,"Well, we didn't have actual hay from Yakyakistan, but we tried our best to make it just like yours."
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,prince rutherford,Not perfect! Yaks destroy!
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,applejack,"Pinkie Pie, what do we do?!"
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,pinkie pie,"And now, for your entertainment pleasure... Presenting animals, Yakyakistan style!"
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,prince rutherford,Animals cute.
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,fluttershy,Oh. Thank goodness.
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,prince rutherford,Wait. These antlers lie! These not Yakyakistani animals! Yaks smash!
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,pinkie pie,"Okay, well... There's still other things we can do. I think."
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,rarity,"Yes! These are some of my favorite materials. Very rare, imported from the Crystal Empire to match your northern sensibilities. I hope you'll find them<U+0097>"
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,rarity,...delicious.
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,prince rutherford,This no taste like yak fabric! Yaks destroy!
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,pinkie pie,Everything's gonna be fine. You'll just... make it up to them. Somehow.
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,pinkie pie,"Listen up! Tell your faces to hold onto their frowns, 'cause they're about to get turned upside-down!"
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,prince rutherford,"Hold your frown, face!"
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,pinkie pie,"Hit it, Rainbow Dash!"
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,pinkie pie,"Just like Yakyakistan snow, right? Because snow is snow, no matter where it comes from."
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,prince rutherford,[slurp] This not yak snow!
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,pinkie pie,Seriously?! ...Seriously?
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,applejack,Y'know... it's goin' okay.
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,rarity,"Satisfactory, I'd say."
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,rainbow dash,It could be better.
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,fluttershy,[whispering] It's not very good.
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,pinkie pie,It's a disaster!
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,twilight sparkle,"Pinkie Pie, tonight's Yakyakistan theme party is more important than ever! You'll make them forget all about this afternoon, right? Because if it's not perfect, they're gonna smash everything! And I'm not sure how much more smashing this visit can take!"
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,pinkie pie,I definitely will! I think. Maybe...?
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,applejack,You're the best gosh-darn party planner in Equestria.
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,rainbow dash,You'll show 'em a good time!
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,fluttershy,You can do it!
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,rarity,"We have absolute confidence in your abilities, Pinkie Pie."
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,pinkie pie,It's going to be my most happy-tacular party ever! I hope!
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,rainbow dash,Why are your eyes darting around like that?
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,twilight sparkle,"Pinkie Pie, I don't know what we'd do without you<U+0097>"
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,pinkie pie,Me either! Gotta go!
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,pinkie pie,"[hyperventilating] Gummy, what am I gonna do? I had all this amazing stuff planned for the party, but they're gonna hate it! There's no way to make Equestria feel like Yakyakistan. They're just too sensitive! Even Fluttershy made them mad! Fluttershy! Oh... I need a new idea, and I need it now. How am I supposed to make this party feel like Yakyakistan without actually going there and bringing something back?!"
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,twilight sparkle,And this is Sugarcube Corner. They're working hard to make your traditional Yakyakistan cake.
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,prince rutherford,Vanilla extract balance very tricky.
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,twilight sparkle,"Do you mind, um, waiting here for one moment?"
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,twilight sparkle,"How's tonight's party coming? I'm doing what I can, but it's really up to you at this point! ...Pinkie? Where are you?!"
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,twilight sparkle,[teeth chattering] Did you find her?
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,fluttershy,"Angel and I searched the forest, but..."
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,rainbow dash,Aerial recon turned up nothing either.
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,applejack,"I searched the farm inside and out. No Pinkie Pie. But I did find a set of Granny Smith's dentures under the house, so... not a complete loss."
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,rarity,She's simply vanished!
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,twilight sparkle,But the party! It's all we have left! What are we gonna do?!
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,twilight sparkle,"[reading] ""Don't worry. I'll be back in time for the party. Love, Pinkie Pie."" If Pinkie Pie says she'll be back in time for the party, she'll be back. We have to trust her. Right? [nervous laugh] No reason to freak out!"
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,fluttershy,"Don't worry, Twilight."
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,applejack,"When it comes to parties, I think she knows what she's doin'."
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,twilight sparkle,[inhales] [exhales] You're right. Let's just focus on keeping the yaks happy 'til she's back.
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,rainbow dash,Piece o' cake.
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,twilight sparkle,The cake!
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,mrs. cake,"Mrs. One bite, and you'll be transported right back to Yakyakistan. [nervous laugh] I hope."
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,prince rutherford,[chewing] Hmm... Ponies too heavy on vanilla extract!
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,twilight sparkle,We've never needed a party so badly.
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,pinkie pie,"And so my quest begins. I know what you're thinking. ""Why go to Yakyakistan alone, Pinkie Pie?"" Because I'm the party planner. This burden falls on my rump and my rump alone. If I want a great party, I gotta climb the mountains north of the Crystal Empire, find Yakyakistan, and come back with something authentic! Know what I mean?"
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,pinkie pie,Did we go the wrong way? Where's all the snow? Please tell me this is magical sand-colored snow. [spits] Nope. Sand. Definitely sand.
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,pinkie pie,"Curse you, sheep! Thanks for you help, conductor."
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,pinkie pie,Cherry Jubilee!
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,pinkie pie,How are you? You look amazing! I need help.
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,pinkie pie,Have you heard of Yakyakistan? Do you have any idea how I can get there?
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,pinkie pie,Counting cherries? How many?
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,pinkie pie,Whoa!
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,pinkie pie,"And so my quest resumes. As I stare across the endless desert, I tell myself I will soon triumphantly enter the homeland of our noble guests and return with a prize to make the best party they've ever seen. Know what I mean?"
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,pinkie pie,Cherry? Ravine. Ravine!
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,pinkie pie,Wake up! Wake up! [grunting] Stooooop!
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,pinkie pie,That's what I said.
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,prince rutherford,Music beautiful. Much soul.
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,twilight sparkle,Phew!
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,spike,"[sighs] When Twilight told me to stall<U+0097> I-I mean, entertain you, I thought there's no way I could<U+0097>"
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,twilight sparkle,Spike!
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,prince rutherford,We demand party! Party now or yaks no friends!
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,twilight sparkle,No! Just a little longer!
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,prince rutherford,"No more longer! We leave now! Yak go to train, return with more yaks! We declare war!"
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,twilight sparkle,No Pinkie Pie? What's this?!
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,applejack,Heh-heh. We panicked and tried to plan our own party.
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,rainbow dash,It's sort of panic-themed.
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,twilight sparkle,The yaks are going home! This is awful! I wanted to surprise Princess Celestia. Now the only surprise is that I may have just started a war.
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,pinkie pie,"There we were, face-to-face with Falling Pony Ravine. Down, down, down! And then, suddenly... Pow! We were rescued mid-air by the Wonderbolts! And then they gave me a ride to Manehattan, I joined a traveling band, we played some shows here and there, got popular, almost made it big until creative differences tore us apart. And that's when I knew I had to get back on with my journey to the Crystal Empire, the gateway to Yakyakistan! And so here I am. It was a major adventure that took most of the afternoon. Know what I mean?"
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,princess cadance,This is it. The northern boundary of the Crystal Empire. Beyond lies Yakyakistan. Nopony who's attempted this climb has ever returned. Are you sure you have to do this?
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,pinkie pie,I do.
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,princess cadance,"Good luck, Pinkie Pie."
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,twilight sparkle,How could she be so late to the party? This isn't like her.
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,fluttershy,I'm sure she's trying her best.
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,rainbow dash,Pinkie Pie's tougher than she looks.
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,pinkie pie,"Hi! My name is Pinkie Pie! I'm looking for Yakyakistan. You know, faraway land, lots of yaks? Maybe you've heard of it?"
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,pinkie pie,Whoa-ho-ho! Slow down! I can't understand a word you're saying<U+0097>
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,pinkie pie,[yelps] There it is! Yakyakistan!
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,twilight sparkle,Ugh. Is everypony alright?
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,fluttershy,I can't tell if my eyes are open or closed.
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,rainbow dash,I think I can see a little bit.
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,rainbow dash,Gah! Nope.
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,applejack,Look at these! Pinkie Pie's made files for everypony in town!
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,fluttershy,With exactly what kind of parties we like.
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,rainbow dash,Pinkie Pie has a secret party-planning cave?! How cool is this?!
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,fluttershy,"[reading] ""Twilight Sparkle likes vanilla ice cream, red balloons, dancing..."""
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,twilight sparkle,That's right!
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,fluttershy,"""But she's afraid of quesadillas."""
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,twilight sparkle,"No, I'm not! They're just so... [shudders] cheesy."
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,pinkie pie,"[fading in] ...oooooooo! No! I'm all the way back where I started! Gummy, I was this close to helping Twilight befriend the yaks. Now I've just let everypony down."
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,pinkie pie,Hmm?
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,applejack,Looky here. It's notes for the party she wants to throw for her folks' fiftieth anniversary. But they ain't nearly that old! Huh. She's already plannin' their one-hundredth too. And their five-hundredth?
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,twilight sparkle,I had no idea she worked so hard on her parties.
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,rainbow dash,"She may be more organized than you, Twilight."
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,twilight sparkle,Let's not get carried away.
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,rarity,I just wish Pinkie Pie were here so we could tell her how much we all appreciate her hard work.
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,pinkie pie,[tearing up] Thank you! Thank you! I love you too! All of you!
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,twilight sparkle,You're back!
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,pinkie pie,"I tried to go to Yakyakistan so I could bring something back for my party. But at the last second, I made a mistake. [sighs] I worked harder on this party than any party ever. But I'm still just a big failure."
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,twilight sparkle,"Pinkie Pie, you're not a failure."
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,fluttershy,What matters is how hard you tried.
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,rainbow dash,Who else would've gone all across Equestria to plan one party?
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,pinkie pie,You know... the trip was really hard. But everypony I met along the way was so helpful. I just wish the yaks could see how friendly and wonderful and great Equestria really is! [gasps] I just got the best party idea ever!
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,twilight sparkle,It's too late. The yaks left on the last train.
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,pinkie pie,"Um, no, they didn't. [squeals] Trust me! There are a whole lot of sheep out there!"
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,fluttershy,"So, um, do we walk back up the slide or... or what?"
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,pinkie pie,"I never thought I'd say this, but... thank you, sheep! And now, if it's okay with you, it's party time!"
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,twilight sparkle,"Wow, Pinkie. This came together quick, even for you."
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,pinkie pie,"What can I say? I'm good at what I do. Prince Rutherford, every time we tried to make something in Equestria feel like Yakyakistan, we couldn't get it right. When I got back from my adventure, I realized something. We shouldn't try to make Equestria feel like your home. We should try to make you feel at home in Equestria. And that means showing you why we love it here, so you'll love it too."
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,prince rutherford,Pink pony work hard to make yaks feel at home. Now yaks happy. No declare war.
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,prince rutherford,Ponies and yaks... friends?
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,pinkie pie,For a thousand moons?
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,prince rutherford,For a thousand moons!
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,princess celestia,"I am very impressed, princess."
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,twilight sparkle,Heh. Just doing my best to spread friendship.
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,princess celestia,And you did a wonderful job of it. You and your friends.
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,prince rutherford,"Pink pony, you understand yaks now."
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,pinkie pie,"Aww, come here, you!"
Party Pooped,Nick Confalone; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,pinkie pie,"[strained] Wow! Too strong! Okay, okay, okay!"
Amending Fences,M. A. Larson,spike,[sighs] You know the worst thing about you being the Princess of Friendship? The dishes.
Amending Fences,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Thanks for taking care of that, Spike. After three events in one week, I really needed to relax with a good book."
Amending Fences,M. A. Larson,spike,"It's kinda funny, isn't it? All these ponies comin' to you for advice about friendship?"
Amending Fences,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,What's funny about that?
Amending Fences,M. A. Larson,spike,"You know, 'cause you used to be famous for being such a bad friend."
Amending Fences,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,What are you talking about? I had good friends in Canterlot.
Amending Fences,M. A. Larson,spike,"Come on, Twilight. Look at the wall. D'ya see any photos from before we moved to Ponyville? And look at you now <U+0096> the Princess of Friendship."
Amending Fences,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,[gasps] This is a disaster! All my old friends! I can't remember any of their names right now! But do you really think that they think I'm a bad friend?!
Amending Fences,M. A. Larson,spike,"Well, I only meant that you've come so far. You're a great friend now and<U+0097>"
Amending Fences,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Oh, I feel terrible! I've gotta make it up to them! Pack a bag, Spike! We're going to Canterlot! And make a list of my friends' names."
Amending Fences,M. A. Larson,spike,Aw. Me and my big mouth.
Amending Fences,M. A. Larson,spike,"Come on, Twilight. You're getting worked up about nothin'."
Amending Fences,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,The only logical place to start is at the beginning.
Amending Fences,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,Oh. It's exactly how we left it! [blows] Look! It's Predictions and Prophecies! And it's still open to the Elements of Harmony!
Amending Fences,M. A. Larson,spike,"And here's that present I was gonna give Moon Dancer! Huh. Guess she won't be needing that. Hey, look! The rest of it's still here!"
Amending Fences,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,How could I have let this happen?
Amending Fences,M. A. Larson,spike,"Come on, Twilight. Princess Celestia gave you an assignment. Nopony could blame you for that."
Amending Fences,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,But look at the way I left this place. It's a total mess! Just like how I left my friendships.
Amending Fences,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,I've gotta make it up toooo... uh...
Amending Fences,M. A. Larson,spike,"Oh! Uh, Minuette, Twinkleshine, Lemon Hearts, Lyra Heartstrings, and Moon Dancer."
Amending Fences,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,Yeah. Them.
Amending Fences,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,Spike! Come on! We've got work to do!
Amending Fences,M. A. Larson,spike,[groans] Have you been awake all night?
Amending Fences,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"I did a little research, and I think I know where we can find Minuette! That is one of my friends, right?"
Amending Fences,M. A. Larson,spike,"Uh, it's not too late to forget I opened my big mouth."
Amending Fences,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"No, Spike, I'm glad you opened your big mouth. These ponies have probably been suffering ever since I left. Wondering why their supposed friend would treat them so badly!"
Amending Fences,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,Minuette?
Amending Fences,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,Of course! My old friends!
Amending Fences,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,This is perfect! I can apologize to all three of them at once!
Amending Fences,M. A. Larson,spike,Let's hope they're not as traumatized as Minuette.
Amending Fences,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,You did?
Amending Fences,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,Oh.
Amending Fences,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Well, uh, you see... [sighs] I came to apologize."
Amending Fences,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Before I left Canterlot, I didn't really appreciate my friends. And that's because I didn't know how important friendship was. But I've learned so much since I moved to Ponyville. I learned what it means to be a good friend and that I certainly wasn't one to the three of you. So for all the pain I caused you, I am truly sorry."
Amending Fences,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,[gasps] It's our old science lab! I have so many great memories of this place!
Amending Fences,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,Whatever happened to Moon Dancer?
Amending Fences,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Yeah, you know, our other friend."
Amending Fences,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,Moon Dancer?
Amending Fences,M. A. Larson,moon dancer,What do you want? I'm trying to study.
Amending Fences,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,It's us! Your old friends!
Amending Fences,M. A. Larson,moon dancer,Ugh!
Amending Fences,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,Exactly how I used to be.
Amending Fences,M. A. Larson,spike,"[sighs] Come on, Twilight! We've been watching her for three days! Library, house, library, house. That's it!"
Amending Fences,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,Nopony looks at her or says hello or even gives her a smile. It's like she doesn't even exist. Was she always like this?
Amending Fences,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Oh, sorry, girls... I've got a lot of studying to catch up on."
Amending Fences,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,I had no idea that party was so important to her. I've gotta find a way to make it up to her!
Amending Fences,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"[gasps] [feigned surprise] Oh, my gosh! Moon Dancer?! Is that<U+0097>"
Amending Fences,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Moon Dancer, can I talk to you for a min<U+0097>"
Amending Fences,M. A. Larson,moon dancer,Shh! What is this?
Amending Fences,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Eh, a bubble of silence. I haven't seen you in a while and I thought it might be nice to catch up."
Amending Fences,M. A. Larson,moon dancer,For what purpose?
Amending Fences,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"You know, 'cause we're friends."
Amending Fences,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,I'm really sorry to bother you. I was just hoping we would go outside and talk for a bit.
Amending Fences,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,[whispering] I'm sorry I skipped your party.
Amending Fences,M. A. Larson,moon dancer,[growls] [whispering] Why won't you leave me alone? I'm trying to study! You've got the wrong pony! I don't have parties!
Amending Fences,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,[whispering] You did once. And I was so caught up in my own studying that I didn't take your feelings into account.
Amending Fences,M. A. Larson,moon dancer,"[whispering] Look, Twilight Twinkle<U+0097>"
Amending Fences,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,[whispering] Sparkle.
Amending Fences,M. A. Larson,moon dancer,"[whispering] Whatever! I just need to be alone so I can study without some crazy pony trying to make friends, all right?!"
Amending Fences,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,[whispering] Fine!
Amending Fences,M. A. Larson,moon dancer,[whispering] Wait. How did you get into my book like that?
Amending Fences,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"I've been studying a new studying technique. I can only do it for a few minutes, but you'd be amazed how much you can pick up when you're actually in a book!"
Amending Fences,M. A. Larson,moon dancer,It's one of Hayscartes' methods.
Amending Fences,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,You know Hayscartes?
Amending Fences,M. A. Larson,moon dancer,Of course! He's a genius!
Amending Fences,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"I have a copy of his Treatise on Ponies, you know."
Amending Fences,M. A. Larson,moon dancer,What is this place?
Amending Fences,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"This is where I used to live. You mean, I never had you over?"
Amending Fences,M. A. Larson,moon dancer,"Wow! A first edition of Principles of Magic! Hey, didn't I give this to you?"
Amending Fences,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,Maybe?
Amending Fences,M. A. Larson,moon dancer,"I did! Look, I even wrote something! ""To my friend, Twilight Sparkle. Thanks for introducing me to the classics."" I can see by the fact that you left it here that it meant a lot to you."
Amending Fences,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Look, I didn't bring you over here for even more poignant reminders of what a bad friend I was. I brought you here to give you this. You can come here whenever you want and study to your heart's content."
Amending Fences,M. A. Larson,moon dancer,Really?
Amending Fences,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"But first, you've gotta do something for me."
Amending Fences,M. A. Larson,moon dancer,What?
Amending Fences,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,Have dinner with our old friends tonight.
Amending Fences,M. A. Larson,moon dancer,I can't. I'm reorganizing my biology scrolls.
Amending Fences,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"I've been spending a lot of time with Minuette, Twinkleshine, and Lemon Hearts since I've been back. They really miss you."
Amending Fences,M. A. Larson,moon dancer,Look! I already told you! The last thing I need is a bunch of ridiculous friend-making keeping me from studying!
Amending Fences,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Moon Dancer, wait! A wise pony once taught me that there's more to life than dusty old books!"
Amending Fences,M. A. Larson,moon dancer,"I tried friendship and it's just not for me. Now, if you'll excuse me..."
Amending Fences,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,What if I taught you Hayscartes' method?
Amending Fences,M. A. Larson,moon dancer,"Science, magic, history, economics, pottery. Things like that."
Amending Fences,M. A. Larson,moon dancer,No.
Amending Fences,M. A. Larson,moon dancer,Can I go now?
Amending Fences,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Moon Dancer, please."
Amending Fences,M. A. Larson,moon dancer,Slumber 101? I've read that.
Amending Fences,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Oh! [chuckles] Really? Well, uh, did you know Lemon Hearts here works at the Canterlot palace?"
Amending Fences,M. A. Larson,moon dancer,Ugh!
Amending Fences,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,Moon Dancer! [teleportation zap] You've gotta give friendship a chance!
Amending Fences,M. A. Larson,moon dancer,Dah! I gave friendship a chance a long time ago! It didn't work out then <U+0096> it isn't gonna work out now!
Amending Fences,M. A. Larson,spike,"Twilight, are you all right?"
Amending Fences,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"No. No, I'm not."
Amending Fences,M. A. Larson,spike,W-Where are you goin'?
Amending Fences,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"I don't know, Spike. I really messed this one up. That party was everything to her. I can only imagine what it must've felt like when I didn't show up."
Amending Fences,M. A. Larson,moon dancer,Thank you so much for coming!
Amending Fences,M. A. Larson,moon dancer,Is Twilight coming?
Amending Fences,M. A. Larson,moon dancer,Oh. Okay.
Amending Fences,M. A. Larson,moon dancer,Sure...
Amending Fences,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,If there was only a way to undo the damage... I know what I need to do. And I know just who can help me.
Amending Fences,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,Wheeeeeeeee!
Amending Fences,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,[laughing] Whoooooaaa!
Amending Fences,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,"That was awesome! We gotta go flying more often, Twilight!"
Amending Fences,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"I did head home. But not to throw in the towel. I went to get my secret weapon. Minuette, meet<U+0097>"
Amending Fences,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,"Hi, Minuette! Twilight, you didn't say Minuette would be here!"
Amending Fences,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,You two know each other?
Amending Fences,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,"Oh, sure! She was one of Cadance's bridesmaids! We hang out all the time when she's in Ponyville! Didn't you know that? Ha! And you call yourself the Princess of Friendship! Twilight briefed me on the way here. We'll need fifteen bags of confetti and as many hooves as we can get."
Amending Fences,M. A. Larson,spike,And what are we gonna do?
Amending Fences,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,Just come with me.
Amending Fences,M. A. Larson,moon dancer,Ooh! A Brief History of the Wagon Harness! Huh? The Life and Times of Morari the Maneless?
Amending Fences,M. A. Larson,moon dancer,What is this?
Amending Fences,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,It's a party. For you.
Amending Fences,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,Surprise!
Amending Fences,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,Come on in!
Amending Fences,M. A. Larson,moon dancer,Thanks but no thanks. I don't do parties.
Amending Fences,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"I know. And I think it's my fault. Back when we were in school together, you invited me to a party. I was so focused on my studies that I didn't show up."
Amending Fences,M. A. Larson,moon dancer,Big deal!
Amending Fences,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"It was a big deal. And now that I realize how important friendship is, I'd like to make up for my mistake with a new party. A party in honor of my friend Moon Dancer! Please, you've got to let me make this up to you."
Amending Fences,M. A. Larson,moon dancer,"And you think this is gonna do it, huh?"
Amending Fences,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Uh, yes?"
Amending Fences,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"You're right. This party can't make up for the way I hurt you. But please, don't let my mistake be the reason you can't be friends with anypony else."
Amending Fences,M. A. Larson,moon dancer,"[sobs, sniffles] What? That's the librarian! The bookseller! My sister!"
Amending Fences,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"I'm sorry, Moon Dancer. I've faced magical creatures, the end of Equestria, all sorts of things. But seeing how my actions affected you, that was one of the worst feelings I've ever had."
Amending Fences,M. A. Larson,moon dancer,"[sobs] Thank you, Twilight. I never realized how much I needed to hear that. Now come on, everypony! Let's party! Right?"
Amending Fences,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,Right!
Amending Fences,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"I think it's time for us to go, Moon Dancer."
Amending Fences,M. A. Larson,moon dancer,Thank you for helping me make some new friends. Even if they are my old friends.
Amending Fences,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,Oh. We'll come back and visit soon.
Amending Fences,M. A. Larson,moon dancer,That would be great! You've still gotta teach me that Hayscartes technique!
Amending Fences,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,Deal.
Amending Fences,M. A. Larson,spike,"Um, Moon Dancer? It got kinda banged up, but here's a little something I wanted to give you back at your first party."
Do Princesses Dream of Magic Sheep?,Scott Sonneborn; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,twilight sparkle,Princess Luna's turning into Nightmare Moon again!
Do Princesses Dream of Magic Sheep?,Scott Sonneborn; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,rainbow dash,"Yeah? Well, we've got the cure for that!"
Do Princesses Dream of Magic Sheep?,Scott Sonneborn; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,princess luna,[gasps] What? My dream ended... happily? That. Cannot. Happen!
Do Princesses Dream of Magic Sheep?,Scott Sonneborn; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,pinkie pie,"Ooh, this is amazing!"
Do Princesses Dream of Magic Sheep?,Scott Sonneborn; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,rainbow dash,"[yawns] [tired throughout] Yeah, Rarity. Thanks for setting all this up."
Do Princesses Dream of Magic Sheep?,Scott Sonneborn; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,fluttershy,[tired throughout] A grooming day for our pets really was a great idea.
Do Princesses Dream of Magic Sheep?,Scott Sonneborn; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,rarity,"[tired throughout] Oh, my! Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't get my normal beauty sleep last night..."
Do Princesses Dream of Magic Sheep?,Scott Sonneborn; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,twilight sparkle,[tired throughout] You know... [yawns] I didn't sleep well either.
Do Princesses Dream of Magic Sheep?,Scott Sonneborn; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,applejack,[tired throughout] Mm-hmm.
Do Princesses Dream of Magic Sheep?,Scott Sonneborn; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,rainbow dash,Uh-huh.
Do Princesses Dream of Magic Sheep?,Scott Sonneborn; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,pinkie pie,I'm totally beat too!
Do Princesses Dream of Magic Sheep?,Scott Sonneborn; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,applejack,"All right, Winona. Time for your brushin'."
Do Princesses Dream of Magic Sheep?,Scott Sonneborn; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,applejack,Oops. I guess I'm too plumb tuckered out to do this right.
Do Princesses Dream of Magic Sheep?,Scott Sonneborn; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,fluttershy,[yawns] I even went to bed early last night... but then I had a really scary nightmare.
Do Princesses Dream of Magic Sheep?,Scott Sonneborn; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,rainbow dash,"Uh, only, you know, I didn't think mine was that scary!"
Do Princesses Dream of Magic Sheep?,Scott Sonneborn; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,twilight sparkle,"Well, mine sure was. There was this blue smoke monster and... what?"
Do Princesses Dream of Magic Sheep?,Scott Sonneborn; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,fluttershy,I dreamt about a blue smoke thingy too!
Do Princesses Dream of Magic Sheep?,Scott Sonneborn; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,rainbow dash,So what? Probably just a coincidence.
Do Princesses Dream of Magic Sheep?,Scott Sonneborn; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,twilight sparkle,That's an awfully big coincidence.
Do Princesses Dream of Magic Sheep?,Scott Sonneborn; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,spike,Huh. I wonder why I didn't have that nightmare. I slept great!
Do Princesses Dream of Magic Sheep?,Scott Sonneborn; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,rarity,"So then, what could've given us all the same nightmare?"
Do Princesses Dream of Magic Sheep?,Scott Sonneborn; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,twilight sparkle,"I don't know, but I do know who might. Spike, could you send a scroll to Princess Luna?"
Do Princesses Dream of Magic Sheep?,Scott Sonneborn; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,spike,Sure! All set!
Do Princesses Dream of Magic Sheep?,Scott Sonneborn; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,twilight sparkle,"Dear Princess Luna, last night my friends and I all dreamt of a creature made of blue smoke. I'm sure you're very busy, but [yawns] when you have the chance, please let me know if you have any idea what it could mean. Yours, [yawns] Princess Twilight Sparkle. You can leave out the yawns."
Do Princesses Dream of Magic Sheep?,Scott Sonneborn; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,princess luna,Which of you saw the creature of blue smoke in your nightmare?!
Do Princesses Dream of Magic Sheep?,Scott Sonneborn; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,fluttershy,Wow. That was fast.
Do Princesses Dream of Magic Sheep?,Scott Sonneborn; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,twilight sparkle,We all did.
Do Princesses Dream of Magic Sheep?,Scott Sonneborn; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,spike,Not me!
Do Princesses Dream of Magic Sheep?,Scott Sonneborn; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,twilight sparkle,So you've encountered the smoke monster too?
Do Princesses Dream of Magic Sheep?,Scott Sonneborn; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,princess luna,The Tantabus is a creature of my nightmares. It escaped from my slumbers yesterday.
Do Princesses Dream of Magic Sheep?,Scott Sonneborn; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,fluttershy,But how did it get into ours?
Do Princesses Dream of Magic Sheep?,Scott Sonneborn; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,princess luna,The Tantabus is like a parasite. My dreams must no longer be enough for it. Now it seeks others to infect and corrupt. It must have learned of you six from seeing you in my dream.
Do Princesses Dream of Magic Sheep?,Scott Sonneborn; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,rainbow dash,"Uh, so Smokey gave us bad dreams. No biggie."
Do Princesses Dream of Magic Sheep?,Scott Sonneborn; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,princess luna,"I saw that the Tantabus had grown more powerful, but I did not realize that power was enough to enable it to escape my dreams. If its power grows, it could very well find a way to escape into the real world. It could turn all of Equestria into a living nightmare!"
Do Princesses Dream of Magic Sheep?,Scott Sonneborn; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,rainbow dash,"Okay, okay, okay, I take it back! That does sound bad! Really bad!"
Do Princesses Dream of Magic Sheep?,Scott Sonneborn; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,twilight sparkle,We've prepared everything exactly as you requested.
Do Princesses Dream of Magic Sheep?,Scott Sonneborn; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,princess luna,"Good. As you six slumber here, I will pursue the creature into whichever of your dreams it infests."
Do Princesses Dream of Magic Sheep?,Scott Sonneborn; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,pinkie pie,Ooh! It'll be like a princess sleepover!
Do Princesses Dream of Magic Sheep?,Scott Sonneborn; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,twilight sparkle,"Speaking of princesses, aren't you gonna ask Celestia for her help as well?"
Do Princesses Dream of Magic Sheep?,Scott Sonneborn; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,princess luna,There is nothing my sister can do. She has no power in the realm of sleep. Only I can move from dream to dream. I am afraid nopony can help me tonight.
Do Princesses Dream of Magic Sheep?,Scott Sonneborn; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,applejack,Even us?
Do Princesses Dream of Magic Sheep?,Scott Sonneborn; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,princess luna,Especially you. You have all suffered so much because of me. You need only slumber while I hunt the Tantabus in your dreams.
Do Princesses Dream of Magic Sheep?,Scott Sonneborn; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,spike,"I know you said nopony can help, but I'm no pony! I'm gonna stay up and watch over you guys just in case!"
Do Princesses Dream of Magic Sheep?,Scott Sonneborn; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,twilight sparkle,"Aw, thank you, Spike!"
Do Princesses Dream of Magic Sheep?,Scott Sonneborn; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,applejack,[yawns] One good thing about not sleepin' well last night <U+0096> shouldn't be too hard to fall asleep now.
Do Princesses Dream of Magic Sheep?,Scott Sonneborn; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,rarity,"Oh, my! [gasps] This is simply divine! How avant garde!"
Do Princesses Dream of Magic Sheep?,Scott Sonneborn; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,princess luna,It is here!
Do Princesses Dream of Magic Sheep?,Scott Sonneborn; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,rarity,[gasps] It was such a pretty little chiffon...! What kind of monster would do this?!
Do Princesses Dream of Magic Sheep?,Scott Sonneborn; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,princess luna,The Tantabus.
Do Princesses Dream of Magic Sheep?,Scott Sonneborn; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,rarity,Then let's stop it!
Do Princesses Dream of Magic Sheep?,Scott Sonneborn; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,princess luna,"No, please! I don't want you to suffer anymore because of me. I will catch it."
Do Princesses Dream of Magic Sheep?,Scott Sonneborn; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,princess luna,"It has jumped into another dream! I am sorry, but if I am to stop it, I must follow it where you cannot."
Do Princesses Dream of Magic Sheep?,Scott Sonneborn; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,rarity,Go! I should be able to handle things here. [gulps] I hope...!
Do Princesses Dream of Magic Sheep?,Scott Sonneborn; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,pinkie pie,"La-la-la-la-la! Whee! Whee, ha-ha!"
Do Princesses Dream of Magic Sheep?,Scott Sonneborn; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,pinkie pie,La-la-la-la-la!
Do Princesses Dream of Magic Sheep?,Scott Sonneborn; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,princess luna,I followed the Tantabus here. Now I need only find<U+0097>
Do Princesses Dream of Magic Sheep?,Scott Sonneborn; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,pinkie pie,"Sorry, can't help it! An idea pops into my head, it<U+0097> [gasps] Ooh, cake!"
Do Princesses Dream of Magic Sheep?,Scott Sonneborn; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,pinkie pie,"Ew, cake!"
Do Princesses Dream of Magic Sheep?,Scott Sonneborn; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,princess luna,[inhales] [grunts] No!
Do Princesses Dream of Magic Sheep?,Scott Sonneborn; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,pinkie pie,Sorry!
Do Princesses Dream of Magic Sheep?,Scott Sonneborn; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,pinkie pie,Who wants ice cream?!
Do Princesses Dream of Magic Sheep?,Scott Sonneborn; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,fluttershy,"Mmm, it's so nice to be the pet for once."
Do Princesses Dream of Magic Sheep?,Scott Sonneborn; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,fluttershy,"N-n-n-n-nice... giant... evil Angel...! [screams] Phew! Oh, thank you, princess!"
Do Princesses Dream of Magic Sheep?,Scott Sonneborn; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,applejack,[sighs] Now this is what I call an incredible dream.
Do Princesses Dream of Magic Sheep?,Scott Sonneborn; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,princess luna,I can see the Tantabus has already turned your slumbers into a nightmare!
Do Princesses Dream of Magic Sheep?,Scott Sonneborn; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,rainbow dash,What are you talking about? This is my favorite dream!
Do Princesses Dream of Magic Sheep?,Scott Sonneborn; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,rainbow dash,Hyah!
Do Princesses Dream of Magic Sheep?,Scott Sonneborn; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,twilight sparkle,Luna!
Do Princesses Dream of Magic Sheep?,Scott Sonneborn; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,spike,What happened? Are you guys okay?
Do Princesses Dream of Magic Sheep?,Scott Sonneborn; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,fluttershy,That... that was terrible! I-I never want to have that nightmare again!
Do Princesses Dream of Magic Sheep?,Scott Sonneborn; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,rainbow dash,[shivers] Me either!
Do Princesses Dream of Magic Sheep?,Scott Sonneborn; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,spike,"But Luna caught it, didn't she?"
Do Princesses Dream of Magic Sheep?,Scott Sonneborn; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,princess luna,"I am so sorry, my friends. I failed. It will be back to infect your dreams the next time you sleep."
Do Princesses Dream of Magic Sheep?,Scott Sonneborn; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,fluttershy,"Oh, no!"
Do Princesses Dream of Magic Sheep?,Scott Sonneborn; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,applejack,Yeah. I reckon I could live without seeing that thing ever again.
Do Princesses Dream of Magic Sheep?,Scott Sonneborn; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,princess luna,"But you will. Again and again, every night, until it grows powerful enough to infect the waking world! After what I did as Nightmare Moon, the fact that I am once again responsible for harming others is more than I can bear."
Do Princesses Dream of Magic Sheep?,Scott Sonneborn; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,pinkie pie,It'll be okay! Everypony makes mistakes!
Do Princesses Dream of Magic Sheep?,Scott Sonneborn; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,princess luna,"As long as none of you dreamt about another pony, the Tantabus remains confined to your dreams. I still have a chance to catch it before it's too late."
Do Princesses Dream of Magic Sheep?,Scott Sonneborn; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,pinkie pie,"Phew, that's good to hear! Although after you left, I did happen to dream that I was eating a giant ice-cream cone with all of Ponyville while taking a test we hadn't studied for. See, what'd I tell ya? Everypony makes mistakes!"
Do Princesses Dream of Magic Sheep?,Scott Sonneborn; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,twilight sparkle,But that means the Tantabus could be turning every dream in Ponyville into a nightmare!
Do Princesses Dream of Magic Sheep?,Scott Sonneborn; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,princess luna,It is far worse than that. Infecting all those dreams gives it more and more power. Soon it will be able to escape into the real world and infect Equestria with its nightmare plague!
Do Princesses Dream of Magic Sheep?,Scott Sonneborn; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,rarity,Then you must let us help you stop it before that happens!
Do Princesses Dream of Magic Sheep?,Scott Sonneborn; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,fluttershy,But how? The Tantabus was able to escape Luna when it only had six dreams it could get to!
Do Princesses Dream of Magic Sheep?,Scott Sonneborn; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,princess luna,"It is true. With so many dreams to hide in, I do not know how I can catch it."
Do Princesses Dream of Magic Sheep?,Scott Sonneborn; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,twilight sparkle,Hmm... What if everypony in Ponyville were having one dream?
Do Princesses Dream of Magic Sheep?,Scott Sonneborn; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,princess luna,"I... can create shared dreams, yes, but for so many ponies at once? I have never done anything like that. The amount of power it would take..."
Do Princesses Dream of Magic Sheep?,Scott Sonneborn; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,fluttershy,"Well, it is worth a try, isn't it?"
Do Princesses Dream of Magic Sheep?,Scott Sonneborn; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,princess luna,"Of course. I will do anything to end this, including accept your help. I cannot allow the Tantabus to escape into the real world. All of you must now go back to sleep and hope that I can create such a dream."
Do Princesses Dream of Magic Sheep?,Scott Sonneborn; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,twilight sparkle,[gasps] Princess Luna did it!
Do Princesses Dream of Magic Sheep?,Scott Sonneborn; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,applejack,"[shivers] Big Mac! Boy, I'm glad to see somethin' familiar!"
Do Princesses Dream of Magic Sheep?,Scott Sonneborn; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,big mcintosh,Eeyup.
Do Princesses Dream of Magic Sheep?,Scott Sonneborn; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,princess luna,Ponies!
Do Princesses Dream of Magic Sheep?,Scott Sonneborn; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,princess luna,"There is no time for bowing, my friends! There is something coming, something terrible! No, it is already here!"
Do Princesses Dream of Magic Sheep?,Scott Sonneborn; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,princess luna,I am so sorry! I brought this upon you! But I will end it now!
Do Princesses Dream of Magic Sheep?,Scott Sonneborn; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,twilight sparkle,"Princess, what's wrong?"
Do Princesses Dream of Magic Sheep?,Scott Sonneborn; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,princess luna,[grunts] It... is taking all my strength just to hold this massive dream together! You will have to stop it! I truly wish I did not have to ask this of you!
Do Princesses Dream of Magic Sheep?,Scott Sonneborn; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,twilight sparkle,Then you're in luck.
Do Princesses Dream of Magic Sheep?,Scott Sonneborn; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,rainbow dash,Yeah! We're already on it!
Do Princesses Dream of Magic Sheep?,Scott Sonneborn; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,filthy rich,[yelping] Please! I'll pay you anything!
Do Princesses Dream of Magic Sheep?,Scott Sonneborn; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,rainbow dash,I got you!
Do Princesses Dream of Magic Sheep?,Scott Sonneborn; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,applejack,"Oh, no!"
Do Princesses Dream of Magic Sheep?,Scott Sonneborn; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,applejack,"Big Mac! You can do anythin' in a dream, remember?"
Do Princesses Dream of Magic Sheep?,Scott Sonneborn; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,rainbow dash,"Come on! If that Tantabus thing turns any more of this dream against us, we'll be too busy saving ponies to catch it! And it'll grow powerful enough to escape into the real world!"
Do Princesses Dream of Magic Sheep?,Scott Sonneborn; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,applejack,How are we even gonna know when it's able to escape?
Do Princesses Dream of Magic Sheep?,Scott Sonneborn; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,rainbow dash,"Oh, I think we'll know."
Do Princesses Dream of Magic Sheep?,Scott Sonneborn; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,princess luna,"[straining] Hurry, my friends!"
Do Princesses Dream of Magic Sheep?,Scott Sonneborn; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,rainbow dash,What the?!
Do Princesses Dream of Magic Sheep?,Scott Sonneborn; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,fluttershy,"Please, we need your help too!"
Do Princesses Dream of Magic Sheep?,Scott Sonneborn; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,twilight sparkle,Fluttershy's right! We've all got to work together to stop it from escaping!
Do Princesses Dream of Magic Sheep?,Scott Sonneborn; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,mr. cake,Mr. But how can we help? Nopony in Ponyville has your magic or your speed!
Do Princesses Dream of Magic Sheep?,Scott Sonneborn; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,rainbow dash,That's true... in Ponyville!
Do Princesses Dream of Magic Sheep?,Scott Sonneborn; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,applejack,But this here isn't Ponyville! It's a dream!
Do Princesses Dream of Magic Sheep?,Scott Sonneborn; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,big mcintosh,Eeyup!
Do Princesses Dream of Magic Sheep?,Scott Sonneborn; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,twilight sparkle,"And not just any! This is your dream! Anything you can do in your dreams, you can do now!"
Do Princesses Dream of Magic Sheep?,Scott Sonneborn; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,spike,"[clicks fingers] Well, if you're gonna dream, might as well dream big, right? Hi-yah!"
Do Princesses Dream of Magic Sheep?,Scott Sonneborn; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,derpy,Whoo!
Do Princesses Dream of Magic Sheep?,Scott Sonneborn; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,rainbow dash,It's working!
Do Princesses Dream of Magic Sheep?,Scott Sonneborn; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,twilight sparkle,But it's not enough!
Do Princesses Dream of Magic Sheep?,Scott Sonneborn; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,pinkie pie,"Then do more! This is a dream, remember?"
Do Princesses Dream of Magic Sheep?,Scott Sonneborn; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,princess luna,[straining] I cannot hold this dream together much longer! Equestria will fall because of me!
Do Princesses Dream of Magic Sheep?,Scott Sonneborn; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,spike,"Am I crazy, or did it just get even bigger after Luna said that?"
Do Princesses Dream of Magic Sheep?,Scott Sonneborn; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,twilight sparkle,"I think it's feeding off your guilt, Princess Luna!"
Do Princesses Dream of Magic Sheep?,Scott Sonneborn; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,princess luna,"If that is so, then perhaps that is how it grew strong enough to escape in the first place!"
Do Princesses Dream of Magic Sheep?,Scott Sonneborn; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,applejack,Say what now?!
Do Princesses Dream of Magic Sheep?,Scott Sonneborn; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,princess luna,I created the Tantabus to give myself the same nightmare every night... [pants] ...to punish myself for the evil I caused as Nightmare Moon!
Do Princesses Dream of Magic Sheep?,Scott Sonneborn; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,fluttershy,But why would you do that?!
Do Princesses Dream of Magic Sheep?,Scott Sonneborn; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,princess luna,"To make sure I never forgave myself for how much Equestria suffered because of me! But it seems I have not learned my lesson, for now I have only made you suffer more!"
Do Princesses Dream of Magic Sheep?,Scott Sonneborn; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,twilight sparkle,But that means you might just be the key to stopping all this!
Do Princesses Dream of Magic Sheep?,Scott Sonneborn; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,rainbow dash,"Yeah! If it gets strong because you feel bad about what you did as Nightmare Moon, then you just gotta stop feeling bad for what you did!"
Do Princesses Dream of Magic Sheep?,Scott Sonneborn; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,princess luna,How can I forgive myself? I am no better now than I was then. My creation is about to turn the world into a living nightmare!
Do Princesses Dream of Magic Sheep?,Scott Sonneborn; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,twilight sparkle,"But look at what you're doing! Nightmare Moon would've wanted the Tantabus to turn Equestria into a nightmare! You're doing everything you can to stop it! Don't you see? That proves you're not the same pony you were then! Everypony who knows you knows that Nightmare Moon is in the past! We all trust you, Luna! Do you trust us enough to believe we're right?"
Do Princesses Dream of Magic Sheep?,Scott Sonneborn; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,princess luna,...I do!
Do Princesses Dream of Magic Sheep?,Scott Sonneborn; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,princess luna,Thank you. Thank you all.
Do Princesses Dream of Magic Sheep?,Scott Sonneborn; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,twilight sparkle,[gasps] Luna did it!
Do Princesses Dream of Magic Sheep?,Scott Sonneborn; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,applejack,She sure did! Only... I'm not exactly sure what she did.
Do Princesses Dream of Magic Sheep?,Scott Sonneborn; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,twilight sparkle,"Luna created the Tantabus to punish herself! The worse she felt, the more power it had! But once she finally forgave herself for what Nightmare Moon did..."
Do Princesses Dream of Magic Sheep?,Scott Sonneborn; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,spike,Poof!
Do Princesses Dream of Magic Sheep?,Scott Sonneborn; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,fluttershy,Shh!
Do Princesses Dream of Magic Sheep?,Scott Sonneborn; story by Jayson Thiessen & Jim Miller,spike,Huh. Wonder what she's dreaming about now.
Canterlot Boutique,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,[gasps] Was that the Pony Post?!
Canterlot Boutique,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,"Oh, it's just you, Opal."
Canterlot Boutique,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,Ohhh... Every other day he's here like clockwork! Not today! What could possibly be holding him up?!
Canterlot Boutique,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,[muffled] Strawberry cinnamon cilantro salutations!
Canterlot Boutique,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,What?
Canterlot Boutique,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"What indeed. I bet you're wondering what warrants such a welcome! Well, that welcome is warranted by a pony that whisked up a warm batch of strawberry cinnamon cilantro cupcakes!"
Canterlot Boutique,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,[chomp] That strangely sickening flavor combination sounds just as bad as it tastes. [gulps] Ugh. So I came here to offer you some!
Canterlot Boutique,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,"After that visually descriptive and disturbing endorsement, I'll pass."
Canterlot Boutique,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"Oh, I almost forgot! I have this letter for you, Rarity! The post pony was going to deliver it, but after a strawberry cinnamon cilantro cupcake, he was feeling kinda queasy. And since I was heading over anyway, I figured I could do it for him! Here you go!"
Canterlot Boutique,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,[with mouth full] What's it say?
Canterlot Boutique,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,I got it!
Canterlot Boutique,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,Woo-hoo! Got what?
Canterlot Boutique,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,"Oh, I have been holding out for the perfect location, and it finally became available! So now I can fulfill my dream of opening a boutique in Canterlot!"
Canterlot Boutique,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,Rarity's such a savvy businesspony. I'm so impressed she used the huge bonus she earned making the costumes for Sapphire Shores' Equestria-wide tour to open this second boutique!
Canterlot Boutique,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,I take it from your reaction that you like the boutique?
Canterlot Boutique,Amy Keating Rogers,fluttershy,It's lovely.
Canterlot Boutique,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"Gosh, Rarity. I know hard work when I see it, and it looks like you worked your hooves to the nub!"
Canterlot Boutique,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,I don't know. Those hooves don't look nubby. They look scrubbied and buffied and pedied!
Canterlot Boutique,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,"Well, despite my 'nubby scrubby buffy pony pedi, I actually have been working very hard! However, I never could have gotten the boutique ready for the grand opening without the help of my new manager Sassy Saddles!"
Canterlot Boutique,Amy Keating Rogers,sassy saddles,"Bust my buttons, Rarity! The ponies from Ponyville!"
Canterlot Boutique,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,"I knew I needed a manager for Canterlot Carousel, so when Sassy showed me her resum<e9> and I saw that she worked in all of the finest boutiques in Canterlot, I hired her right on the spot!"
Canterlot Boutique,Amy Keating Rogers,sassy saddles,"I then laid out this plan, or ""pattern"" as we say in the fashion biz, for Canterlot Carousel so that Rarity's boutique will be a guaranteed success and those doors will never, ever, ever close!"
Canterlot Boutique,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"Wow, Sassy. Your attention to detail is truly impressive."
Canterlot Boutique,Amy Keating Rogers,sassy saddles,I've already put a pin in the first piece of the pattern <U+0096> Beautify the Boutique! But next was the very crucial pattern piece <U+0096> Marketing to the Mares! Turns out that everypony here loves royalty!
Canterlot Boutique,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,So I created a collection that beautifully revolves around the royal element of Canterlot!
Canterlot Boutique,Amy Keating Rogers,sassy saddles,And it just so happens there's a hot new princess in Equestria!
Canterlot Boutique,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,"[to Twilight] In every poll Sassy Saddles took, you were the most popular princess! Coincidentally, one of my gowns is inspired by the window in Canterlot Castle commemorating your coronation!"
Canterlot Boutique,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,"While I've always prided myself on paying attention to detail, I've taken my latest collection to a whole new level with ""Rarity's Rules of TLC""!"
Canterlot Boutique,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"Judging by this baby, TLC stands for Tasty Liquorice Candy!"
Canterlot Boutique,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,"TLC stands for 'Time, Love, and Couture'. And while I do agree that this dress has potential, I've not had enough time to give it enough love to become couture."
Canterlot Boutique,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,But the rest of the gowns in tonight's line have met Rarity's Rules and are ready to be presented!
Canterlot Boutique,Amy Keating Rogers,sassy saddles,My marketing research also confirmed that customers that viewed somepony famous wearing a gown wish to own that gown for themselves. I call this piece of the pattern Celebrity Status!
Canterlot Boutique,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,"So, Twilight, we were wondering if perhaps you might possibly wear this tonight?"
Canterlot Boutique,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"If being a princess and wearing that dress can help your boutique in any way, then I say stick a pin in it. It's done."
Canterlot Boutique,Amy Keating Rogers,sassy saddles,"Alright, everypony! Let's set the stage!"
Canterlot Boutique,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,"Ever since I was a little filly, all I've ever wanted was to own a boutique here in Canterlot. Somepony pinch me! I'm about to open the doors to that very boutique!"
Canterlot Boutique,Amy Keating Rogers,sassy saddles,Welcome to the grand opening of Canterlot Carousel!
Canterlot Boutique,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"That Sassy totally stepped on your hooves, Rarity."
Canterlot Boutique,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"Oh, no! Did she mess up that nice pony pedi?! [sighs] Okay. Phew!"
Canterlot Boutique,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,"Oh, I don't think she meant to."
Canterlot Boutique,Amy Keating Rogers,sassy saddles,"Rarity, are you ready to reveal the collection?"
Canterlot Boutique,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,[under her breath] Is she sure she doesn't wanna do it herself?
Canterlot Boutique,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,[snorts] [under her breath] Yeah.
Canterlot Boutique,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,"Yes, I am. Fluttershy, could you help Twilight get ready?"
Canterlot Boutique,Amy Keating Rogers,fluttershy,"Oh, certainly."
Canterlot Boutique,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,"Fillies and gentlecolts! I am designer and couturier Rarity, I'd like to welcome you <U+0096> again [laughs nervously] <U+0096> to the grand opening of Canterlot Carousel, and I'm thrilled that you are here to see my newest collection inspired by this regal city!"
Canterlot Boutique,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,Fashion Plate of Cosmare magazine! I'm so honored that Cosmare was able to do a piece on the grand opening of my boutique!
Canterlot Boutique,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,"Oh, uh, it's called ""Rarity's Royal Regalia""."
Canterlot Boutique,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,"My favorite part of being a designer is finding my inspiration, and that really wasn't difficult when it came to Canterlot. Everywhere I looked, the royal city just spoke to me! I call it ""In-spire-ation""."
Canterlot Boutique,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,"I spent hours by the lily pond on the castle grounds, which inspired this gown <U+0096> ""Water Filly""!"
Canterlot Boutique,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,"Watching Celestia raise the sun each morning literally lit up my day... [beat] This is ""Tripping the Light""."
Canterlot Boutique,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,"[giggles] And of course, Luna raising the moon guided me to sleep. I call this ""Over the Moon""!"
Canterlot Boutique,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,"And for our finale, I have something very special. I was inspired by the stained glass window created in honor of Princess Twilight... I call this ""The Reign in Stain""!"
Canterlot Boutique,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,Yes!
Canterlot Boutique,Amy Keating Rogers,sassy saddles,"Oh, well, I think ""The Reign in Stain"" is too difficult to explain! [short laugh] Especially for the signature piece of a collection?"
Canterlot Boutique,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,But I rather like the<U+0097>
Canterlot Boutique,Amy Keating Rogers,sassy saddles,"Fillies and gentlecolts, I, Sassy Saddles, am pleased to introduce the grand finale of the grand opening of Rarity's Royal Regalia <U+0096> the ""Princess Dress""!"
Canterlot Boutique,Amy Keating Rogers,sassy saddles,"Everypony, please follow me and you can all place your orders for the Princess Dress!"
Canterlot Boutique,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,Yeah! Rarity's Royal Regalia is amazing! And everypony seemed to love the Princess Dress!
Canterlot Boutique,Amy Keating Rogers,sassy saddles,You bet your saddle they did. Rarity now has one hundred orders for her signature gown!
Canterlot Boutique,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,[stammers] One hundred orders?! All at one time?!
Canterlot Boutique,Amy Keating Rogers,sassy saddles,"According to my pattern, the next piece is The Success of the Signature Dress, so I do not see the problem!"
Canterlot Boutique,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,Uh...
Canterlot Boutique,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,Cupcake?
Canterlot Boutique,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,"[clears throat] First of all, Sassy Saddles, I would have appreciated getting to name the final gown from my collection myself."
Canterlot Boutique,Amy Keating Rogers,sassy saddles,"[short laugh] My research shows that your ""Reign in Stain"" name was a play on words that was both very confusing and quite unappealing."
Canterlot Boutique,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,"[disgruntled laugh] While I see your point, we should have discussed it prior to the grand opening, Sassy."
Canterlot Boutique,Amy Keating Rogers,sassy saddles,"My only goal is for Canterlot Carousel to succeed. That's why I changed the name, and that is why I took all those orders for the Princess Dress."
Canterlot Boutique,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,"[stammering] But... But receiving orders for one hundred dresses in one day, [stammering] it's just too much too soon!"
Canterlot Boutique,Amy Keating Rogers,sassy saddles,Are you actually saying we should... cancel these orders?!
Canterlot Boutique,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,"Wha... But... [stammering] Uh, n-no, Sassy. Promises were made, and I shall sew my very best to provide each and every pony a Princess Dress full of TLC."
Canterlot Boutique,Amy Keating Rogers,sassy saddles,"Oh, thank you, Rarity, thank you!"
Canterlot Boutique,Amy Keating Rogers,sassy saddles,"Oh, satin and silk, Rarity, are you sure you don't want your friends to help you make the dresses?"
Canterlot Boutique,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,"No, Sassy. These orders are my responsibility. All I have to do is stick to my plan so I can deliver each and every Princess Dress in keeping with my Rules of Rarity!"
Canterlot Boutique,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,"The rules of Rarity, guaranteed quality This I can assure For each and every dress I vow to give finesse With time, love, and couture"
Canterlot Boutique,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,Is that the customer who ordered this Princess Dress?
Canterlot Boutique,Amy Keating Rogers,sassy saddles,I'll take care of her. You keep working.
Canterlot Boutique,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,"Uh, actually, I'd love to see her reaction to this particular dress."
Canterlot Boutique,Amy Keating Rogers,sassy saddles,"Paisley and poplin, Rarity, look at all the orders you still have to finish, and you want to take a break? Now?"
Canterlot Boutique,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,"Well, it's just I made some really lovely changes to this dress<U+0097>"
Canterlot Boutique,Amy Keating Rogers,sassy saddles,You did what?! But every Princess Dress is supposed to be exactly the same!
Canterlot Boutique,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,"Yes yes I know, but these gems just spoke to me, and<U+0097>"
Canterlot Boutique,Amy Keating Rogers,sassy saddles,Fine. Go see her reaction.
Canterlot Boutique,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,"Hello, and welcome to Canterlot Carousel! I am so pleased to present to you your<U+0097>"
Canterlot Boutique,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,"Well as an artiste, I did take the liberty to change a few minor details."
Canterlot Boutique,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,"I, eheh, I saw these gems glistening in the light, and they just spoke to me. Aren't they lovely? And so unique!"
Canterlot Boutique,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,"Uh, no. No, they're not."
Canterlot Boutique,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,"Yes... Y-Yes, of course."
Canterlot Boutique,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,"The rules of Rarity Once stood for something But now it feels just like some factory Now every dress I make With every flaw and mistake Oh, how it makes my heart My heart just break"
Canterlot Boutique,Amy Keating Rogers,sassy saddles,"Raving rick-rack, Rarity! You made two hundred Princess Dresses!"
Canterlot Boutique,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,[deadpan] Yes. Isn't it spectacular?
Canterlot Boutique,Amy Keating Rogers,sassy saddles,And I have a special surprise for you! The latest issue of Cosmare magazine just hit the stands!
Canterlot Boutique,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,"[reading] ""Canterlot's newest rising star""?"
Canterlot Boutique,Amy Keating Rogers,sassy saddles,"And in the hour since the magazine's come out, we've gotten another hundred new orders for the Princess Dress!"
Canterlot Boutique,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,[weakly] One... hundred more... Princess Dresses?! I'm the Cosmare cover pony... I have the most successful shop in Canterlot... I've gotten everything I ever wanted... but I'm miserable!
Canterlot Boutique,Amy Keating Rogers,sassy saddles,"[short laugh] How could you possibly be miserable? My pattern is perfect! Cosmare Cover Pony <U+0096> done! You have your signature gown, the Princess Dress of Success!"
Canterlot Boutique,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,I don't want to make another hundred Princess Dresses!
Canterlot Boutique,Amy Keating Rogers,sassy saddles,I have a piece for that! Assemble the Assembly Line! You'll never have to sew again!
Canterlot Boutique,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,What?! No!
Canterlot Boutique,Amy Keating Rogers,sassy saddles,Yes! Then the Canterlot Carousel never closes! And Sassy Saddles' boutique succeeds!
Canterlot Boutique,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,"Stop! This is not your boutique! And if this is what success in Canterlot looks like, I want no part of it! Now, make up flyers for a going-out-of-business sale! I'm closing Canterlot Carousel!"
Canterlot Boutique,Amy Keating Rogers,sassy saddles,"What?! No! Oh, you can't, Rarity! I-I've worked too hard to make this a success! I can't be a part of another failed boutique!"
Canterlot Boutique,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,"[to a dress] Oh, don't you look lovely? Nice to see you out here again. [to herself, hushed] Seems Sassy Saddles isn't rushing to open the door this time. Hm."
Canterlot Boutique,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,Welcome to the going-out-of-business sale of Canterlot Carousel.
Canterlot Boutique,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,"Oh, no, I'm sorry, the Princess Dress has been discontinued. But there are plenty of other lovely dresses on sale today."
Canterlot Boutique,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,Certainly. The dressing area is right back there.
Canterlot Boutique,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,And I'm sure you'll feel even brighter once you try it on!
Canterlot Boutique,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,"Oh, yes, I do. It's-It's right here."
Canterlot Boutique,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,"Hmmm. Perhaps you'd be even more taken with this one. It was inspired by the fountain in the Canterlot Castle garden. I call it the ""Fountain of Truth""!"
Canterlot Boutique,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,"Oh! Well, then I'll finish it, and the gown shall be yours! [to herself] How can I have forgotten? This is what I've been dreaming about!"
Canterlot Boutique,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,"My favorite moment's when a pony sees it That special gown that she just adores That pony's now in style My hard work's all worthwhile Oh, yes, it makes my heart My heart just soar!"
Canterlot Boutique,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,"Attention, everypony! Canterlot Carousel will not be closing!"
Canterlot Boutique,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,"[giggles] Yes, yes, of course."
Canterlot Boutique,Amy Keating Rogers,sassy saddles,"Oh, Rarity, I'm so sorry. I focused on that one dress, and the rest of Rarity's Royal Regalia paid the price."
Canterlot Boutique,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,"Well, so did the Princess Dress. The more I sold, the more each dress lost its time, love, and couture, becoming terrible, lackluster, and common."
Canterlot Boutique,Amy Keating Rogers,sassy saddles,I think I finally understand the Rules of Rarity... and will apply them at my next job.
Canterlot Boutique,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,I beg your pardon? The Rules of Rarity are only to be applied at Canterlot Carousel! Which is why you must continue to manage the boutique while I'm in Ponyville.
Canterlot Boutique,Amy Keating Rogers,sassy saddles,Ponyville?
Canterlot Boutique,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,"Well, yes, I'll come to Canterlot with new designs and to see the customers of course, but Ponyville was always going to be my home base."
Canterlot Boutique,Amy Keating Rogers,sassy saddles,"[gasps] Bobbins and bodkins, Rarity! Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you! And I promise to run everything following your rules."
Canterlot Boutique,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,I would expect nothing less.

Rarity Investigates!,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, M. A. Larson, Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco",rarity,"Oh, I modeled them after the adventures of Shadow Spade. Her stories are always full of mystery and suspense and, best of all... fabulous costumes!"

Rarity Investigates!,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, M. A. Larson, Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco",rainbow dash,"Well, kind of exciting. Technically, I'm not flying. I'm just the lucky Reserve who was called in to be the backup flyer in case a Wonderbolt can't perform."
Rarity Investigates!,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, M. A. Larson, Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco",rarity,"Oh, don't be so modest. Out of all the Reserves, you were the one chosen."

And I do get to stay in the castle, hang out with the Wonderbolts, and eat awesome food at the dinner tonight. Speaking of the dinner, you're still coming, right?"

Rarity Investigates!,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, M. A. Larson, Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco",rarity,"Of course you don't. Your job is so difficult. Honestly, I don't know how you keep all of those orders straight."
Rarity Investigates!,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, M. A. Larson, Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco",rarity,"Oh, y<U+0097>oh yes, and I very much appreciate it. But if there was any way you could squeeze in one more little delivery, I would be eternally grateful."
Rarity Investigates!,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, M. A. Larson, Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco",sassy saddles,"Rarity, you could sweet-talk a filly out of candy!"
Rarity Investigates!,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, M. A. Larson, Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco",rarity,"Oh, [chuckles], it was nothing. Nopony minds a compliment.

Rarity Investigates!,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, M. A. Larson, Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco",rarity,"[narrating] The waters were getting choppy. Rainbow Dash's tactics were, well, horrid. It was time for another approach. [normally] Perhaps I should take it from here! You castle guards have such a difficult job. I'm guessing that at times it can be rather... boring."
Rarity Investigates!,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, M. A. Larson, Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco",rarity,"And of course being a castle guard can be thankless work. I'm not saying you did, but if you took a break, you more than deserved it."

Rarity Investigates!,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, M. A. Larson, Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco",rarity,I have found the culprit!
Rarity Investigates!,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, M. A. Larson, Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco",rarity,Somepony sent Spitfire away and framed Rainbow Dash for it. And that pony was none other than... Wind Rider!
Rarity Investigates!,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, M. A. Larson, Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco",rainbow dash,"Rarity, I can't believe you would accuse Wind Rider of framing me! He's a living legend, for pony's sake!"
Rarity Investigates!,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, M. A. Larson, Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco",rarity,All the evidence points to him!
Rarity Investigates!,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, M. A. Larson, Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco",rainbow dash,"Peh! What evidence could you possibly have? All you did was ask about cake, admire d<e9>cor, and change outfits a gazillion times!"
Rarity Investigates!,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, M. A. Larson, Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco",rarity,"Let me explain. I never believed you would send Spitfire away. When we found the rainbow hairs in Spitfire's room, I could tell they didn't fall out. They... were cut! Nopony loses hair in a chunk. And look at the ends. It's a straight line! They were clearly cut with shears, which means somepony planted it! Then when we were examining Spitfire's room, I smelled something on the envelope. Juniper Phoenix, Wind Rider's cologne of choice! Then, in the castle hallway, I noticed some of the damask curtains fell out of their velvet rope-holder, indicating that somepony had been hiding behind them! Perhaps after they dropped off the fake letter?"
Rarity Investigates!,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, M. A. Larson, Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco",rarity,"Precisely why I questioned the castle guards! They were at their post at the entrance to the hallway all night, except for a small window of time when somepony brought them cake. A cake that was ordered by a girl pony with a raspy voice! Whoever ordered the cake got a chocolate stain on her ivory scarf, and I couldn't help but notice that Wind Rider's scarf is tied in a tight Windsor knot instead of its usual loose slipknot! And why is that? Is it to hide the chocolate stain?!"
Rarity Investigates!,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, M. A. Larson, Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco",rarity,Just admit it <U+0096> you're as guilty of framing Rainbow Dash as you are of ruining that ivory scarf!
Rarity Investigates!,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, M. A. Larson, Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco",rainbow dash,"But why, Wind Rider?! Was it because I took the last broccoli at the dinner and you really, really wanted it?"
Rarity Investigates!,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, M. A. Larson, Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco",rarity,"No. It was because he was afraid that you would break his long-distance Wonderbolt record! I heard him when Spitfire said you were close to breaking his record. He said, and I quote, 'Heh-heh'. That's the polite but disingenuous laugh you make when you want to seem happy but really you're not."
Rarity Investigates!,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, M. A. Larson, Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco",rainbow dash,Really? That is so not cool. And I thought you were the coolest Wonderbolt ever. Until now.
Rarity Investigates!,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, M. A. Larson, Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco",rainbow dash,That's not what being a Wonderbolt is all about.
Rarity Investigates!,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, M. A. Larson, Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco",soarin,"She's right! Wonderbolts look out for each other! Which reminds me, where is Spitfire?"
Rarity Investigates!,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, M. A. Larson, Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco",rainbow dash,No wonder she's been gone so long. Ice irises are almost impossible to find in spring!

Rarity Investigates!,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, M. A. Larson, Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco",rarity,"Well, I didn't want to get your hopes up until I was sure, and I couldn't be sure until I saw that chocolate stain."

Made in Manehattan,Noelle Benvenuti,spike,"Uh, Twilight?"
Made in Manehattan,Noelle Benvenuti,applejack,Where do you think<U+0097>
Made in Manehattan,Noelle Benvenuti,rarity,"[excited squeals] Manehattan! We've been called to Manehattan! Oh, I've simply been dying to go back for a visit! And now I return... with a purpose!"
Made in Manehattan,Noelle Benvenuti,twilight sparkle,Hmmm. It looks like you've been summoned to this particular neighborhood here.
Made in Manehattan,Noelle Benvenuti,applejack,"Seems a hair odd, though, don't it? Map callin' me to a big city like Manehattan?"
Made in Manehattan,Noelle Benvenuti,twilight sparkle,"You may be more of a country pony at heart, Applejack, but the map picked you two because you're the best ponies to tackle this particular mission."
Made in Manehattan,Noelle Benvenuti,applejack,But how will we even know what our mission's supposed to be? That neighborhood probably has twice as many ponies as all of Ponyville.
Made in Manehattan,Noelle Benvenuti,rarity,"Pff. Kch. Ts! More like three times! Why, it's not only home to the Haypacking District <U+0096> it's also home to the Fashion District! [to Twilight] Hmm. Shame you weren't called as well, though, darling. You did end up quite a fan of the hustle and bustle of Manehattan on our last visit."
Made in Manehattan,Noelle Benvenuti,twilight sparkle,"It's such an exciting city, and there's still so much I'd like to do there. So many museums and historical landmarks to visit. Not to mention all the libraries! But this is your mission. Heh-heh. Don't worry about me. I've got plenty of... books... to keep me... busy."
Made in Manehattan,Noelle Benvenuti,rarity,[gasps] I just remembered something! The Sisterhooves Social!
Made in Manehattan,Noelle Benvenuti,applejack,We'll have to miss it. No tellin' how long we'll be in Manehattan. I sure hope Apple Bloom and Sweetie Belle aren't too upset.
Made in Manehattan,Noelle Benvenuti,rarity,"Oh, Manehattan, what you do to me!"
Made in Manehattan,Noelle Benvenuti,rarity,"Darling, are you all right?"
Made in Manehattan,Noelle Benvenuti,applejack,"Ponies move so fast here. Not at all like back home. [to herself] Eyes peeled, ears open. Eyes peeled, ears open."
Made in Manehattan,Noelle Benvenuti,rarity,"Remember, Applejack, you're in the big city now. No moseying. You've gotta walk with speed and confidence!"
Made in Manehattan,Noelle Benvenuti,rarity,Yoo-hoo!
Made in Manehattan,Noelle Benvenuti,applejack,Sorry 'bout that.
Made in Manehattan,Noelle Benvenuti,applejack,Sorry.

Made in Manehattan,Noelle Benvenuti,rarity,[gasps] There!
Made in Manehattan,Noelle Benvenuti,rarity,No! No.
Made in Manehattan,Noelle Benvenuti,rarity,"That hat clashes with your mane, not to mention it's far too large and will undoubtedly obstruct your vision. Oh, dear, none of these will do. Oh, Applejack! What good timing!"
Made in Manehattan,Noelle Benvenuti,rarity,[humming] Here. This will do splendidly.
Made in Manehattan,Noelle Benvenuti,rarity,"Oh, no-no, please, please, keep it. I can always make another."
Made in Manehattan,Noelle Benvenuti,rarity,[to Applejack] And you thought we wouldn't discover our purpose here! Pff. Kch. Ts!
Made in Manehattan,Noelle Benvenuti,applejack,"Yeah, I'm pretty sure that wasn't it."
Made in Manehattan,Noelle Benvenuti,rarity,What? We just saved that poor pony from committing a terrible crime of fashion.
Made in Manehattan,Noelle Benvenuti,rarity,"Well, she could've been meeting a friend who would've laughed at her new hat, and then their friendship could've been ruined forever! And... mmm... it's possible."
Made in Manehattan,Noelle Benvenuti,applejack,Did your cutie mark glow signifyin' a job well done?
Made in Manehattan,Noelle Benvenuti,rarity,"Ye<U+0097> No. I suppose it didn't. Still, a disaster was averted!"
Made in Manehattan,Noelle Benvenuti,rarity,"Oh, my! Oh, I-I-I-I-I'm s-so sorry. I never meant to<U+0097>"
Made in Manehattan,Noelle Benvenuti,rarity,"Uh, please accept my sincerest apologies for the misunderstanding, and might I add, what a lovely establishment you have here! [nervous laugh] [clears throat] You're right, Applejack. [sighs] The search continues."
Made in Manehattan,Noelle Benvenuti,applejack,"Uh, 'scuse me, I was just wonderin'... Uh, friendship problem, anypony? See, we've been sent here to... A-A map summoned us and, uh... If you could just take a moment to..."
Made in Manehattan,Noelle Benvenuti,rarity,Friendship advice! Anypony looking for friendship advice! Good grief. This isn't working.
Made in Manehattan,Noelle Benvenuti,applejack,"[sighs] I'm not sure what we're supposed to do. To be honest, I'm still not even sure what the map called me here for."
Made in Manehattan,Noelle Benvenuti,rarity,"Oh, try not to worry, Applejack. The map picked us for a reason. Although how we're supposed to uncover that reason, I haven't a clue.

The contact on the flyer is Coco Pommel!"
Made in Manehattan,Noelle Benvenuti,applejack,"Oh, right! She's the one you got a job makin' costumes for that designer friend o' yours."
Made in Manehattan,Noelle Benvenuti,rarity,"Don't you see?! This must be why the map called us here! Oh, and you were so worried!"
Made in Manehattan,Noelle Benvenuti,applejack,"Well, I suppose it's at least worth lookin' into... that is, if we can ever get off this street corner."
Made in Manehattan,Noelle Benvenuti,applejack,Y'all do look like you're enjoyin' each others' company. Kinda reminds me of Ponyville.
Made in Manehattan,Noelle Benvenuti,rarity,"It sounds lovely, darling."
Made in Manehattan,Noelle Benvenuti,applejack,What happened?
Made in Manehattan,Noelle Benvenuti,applejack,Nopony else stepped up to take over for Charity?
Made in Manehattan,Noelle Benvenuti,rarity,"Say no more! You finish up your work, and by this time tomorrow, you'll be up to your mane in ponies who want to lend a hoof. Applejack and I will make sure of it!"
Made in Manehattan,Noelle Benvenuti,applejack,You bet your boots we will!
Made in Manehattan,Noelle Benvenuti,applejack,It's just an expression.
Made in Manehattan,Noelle Benvenuti,rarity,"So you see, the Method Mares are only available on this one day, and we need all the help we can get with preparation."
Made in Manehattan,Noelle Benvenuti,rarity,[clearing throat] Well? What do you think?
Made in Manehattan,Noelle Benvenuti,applejack,So you'll help us?
Made in Manehattan,Noelle Benvenuti,rarity,"Oh, not at all, darling. It's quite lovely."
Made in Manehattan,Noelle Benvenuti,applejack,I think she was talkin' about the Midsummer Theater Revival.
Made in Manehattan,Noelle Benvenuti,rarity,"Well, I could help you with the costumes."
Made in Manehattan,Noelle Benvenuti,applejack,"Well I know a thing or two about buildin' and fixin' things. It's kinda, well, my thing. Could be the reason the map called me here!"
Made in Manehattan,Noelle Benvenuti,rarity,"You see, dear? We went out looking for volunteers when all the help you need is right here."
Made in Manehattan,Noelle Benvenuti,applejack,Uh-huh.
Made in Manehattan,Noelle Benvenuti,rarity,The map wouldn't have chosen just Applejack and me if it was more than we could handle. Everything is going to be just fine!
Made in Manehattan,Noelle Benvenuti,rarity,Perhaps I spoke too soon...
Made in Manehattan,Noelle Benvenuti,applejack,"I know it looks bad, but I'm movin' as fast as I can."
Made in Manehattan,Noelle Benvenuti,rarity,"Don't worry, we've still got plenty of time. Everything's going to be<U+0097>"
Made in Manehattan,Noelle Benvenuti,applejack,"No, wait! I haven't gotten a chance to<U+0097>"
Made in Manehattan,Noelle Benvenuti,applejack,...reinforce the stage yet.
Made in Manehattan,Noelle Benvenuti,rarity,"[hushed] I don't understand. The map summoned us here to solve a friendship problem. We've clearly found it, but why did it send the two of us? Why not Twilight? I'm sure she could have used her magic to transform this park in an instant!"
Made in Manehattan,Noelle Benvenuti,applejack,"I've been thinkin' the same thing. I mean, I can at least see why you're here <U+0096> Coco's your friend, and you have an eye for costumes and all <U+0096> but me? I was never gonna be able to finish a project this big."
Made in Manehattan,Noelle Benvenuti,rarity,"[dramatically] We'll return to Ponyville as failures! Why must this be, Applejack? Why? Why?! Wh<U+0097>"
Made in Manehattan,Noelle Benvenuti,applejack,Now hold on there. I'm not suggestin' we pack up and go home.
Made in Manehattan,Noelle Benvenuti,rarity,[muffled] Then what are you suggesting<U+0097> [ptoo] Then what are you suggesting?
Made in Manehattan,Noelle Benvenuti,applejack,"I'm suggestin' we stop worryin' about what we can't do and start doing what we can. I think I've got a plan. It won't be anythin' big or fancy, but it'll be somethin'. And somethin's gotta be better than nothin', right?"
Made in Manehattan,Noelle Benvenuti,applejack,That's the spirit! Sorta...
Made in Manehattan,Noelle Benvenuti,applejack,"Alright, y'all, it's ready!"
Made in Manehattan,Noelle Benvenuti,rarity,"Oh, darling, please, it was just a few costumes."
Made in Manehattan,Noelle Benvenuti,applejack,"Aw, shucks, I just happen to be good with a hammer is all. To be honest, we had much bigger plans to start. When those fell through, we decided to simplify. This here was the result."
Made in Manehattan,Noelle Benvenuti,rarity,"Oh, don't be so modest. Coco and I were lost."
Made in Manehattan,Noelle Benvenuti,applejack,"Oh, yeah?"
Made in Manehattan,Noelle Benvenuti,applejack,"Not sure if you noticed, but the park is far from bein' fixed up. I imagine if you look around, you'll find there's lots of little ways for you to get involved in changin' this place for the better."
Made in Manehattan,Noelle Benvenuti,applejack,Yee-hoo!
Made in Manehattan,Noelle Benvenuti,applejack,We did it!
Made in Manehattan,Noelle Benvenuti,rarity,[gasps] I understand now! It all makes perfect sense!
Made in Manehattan,Noelle Benvenuti,applejack,Huh?
Made in Manehattan,Noelle Benvenuti,rarity,I know why the map called you here.
Made in Manehattan,Noelle Benvenuti,applejack,You do?
Made in Manehattan,Noelle Benvenuti,rarity,"If Twilight had used her magic to fix the park, it wouldn't have fixed the real problem, which is that these Manehattan ponies didn't think they had time to do something for their community! But by building that stage and making sure the play went on, you showed them that just by doing something small, you can make a big difference!"
Made in Manehattan,Noelle Benvenuti,applejack,"Well, I'll be!"
Made in Manehattan,Noelle Benvenuti,rarity,Seems you have more in common with the Manehattan ponies than you thought!
Made in Manehattan,Noelle Benvenuti,applejack,"Heh-heh. But all the same, I'd sure like to head back to Ponyville on the next train. I want to check in with Apple Bloom and find out how the Sisterhooves Social turned out."
Made in Manehattan,Noelle Benvenuti,rarity,"Oh, absolutely, my dear. Just as soon as I stop that pony in the shop over there from purchasing that dreadfully hideous scarf! Stop! You're making a terrible mistake!"
Brotherhooves Social,Dave Polsky,granny smith,"Oh, snickerdoodle! Where is the darned thing? [groans] I wish for once I'd remembered to label these boxes! Uh, Big Mac, be a dear and help me move those... Uh, maybe it's in that one on the bottom."
Brotherhooves Social,Dave Polsky,granny smith,"Oh, dagnabbit, it's not in there either!"
Brotherhooves Social,Dave Polsky,apple bloom,[muffled laughing] [normal] You can't catch me!
Brotherhooves Social,Dave Polsky,applejack,[laughing] Woo-hoo!
Brotherhooves Social,Dave Polsky,apple bloom,Hey!
Brotherhooves Social,Dave Polsky,applejack,[more laughing] You trickster!
Brotherhooves Social,Dave Polsky,granny smith,"Sisterhooves Social is right around the corner.

If you would just help me<U+0097> [straining] pull... this... box, then maybe I can... Uh, Big Mac?"
Brotherhooves Social,Dave Polsky,granny smith,[straining] Found her!
Brotherhooves Social,Dave Polsky,apple bloom,We're gonna win every competition at the Sisterhooves Social! Those other fillies aren't gonna know what hit 'em!
Brotherhooves Social,Dave Polsky,applejack,"Oh. Hey there, Big Mac! Did you want somethin'?"
Brotherhooves Social,Dave Polsky,big mcintosh,Eeyup.
Brotherhooves Social,Dave Polsky,apple bloom,"Hold that thought. Applejack, you are the most awesome sister ever!"
Brotherhooves Social,Dave Polsky,applejack,"Aw, gee-whiz. [laughs]. Well I think it's sweet that you hold that opinion, but<U+0097>"
Brotherhooves Social,Dave Polsky,apple bloom,"It's not opinion! It's objective fact! You saved Equestria like a gazillion times, you're smart, funny, strong... Why you're the best sister of all time! Probably the best Apple of all time! Right, Big Mac?"
Brotherhooves Social,Dave Polsky,big mcintosh,Eeyup.
Brotherhooves Social,Dave Polsky,apple bloom,"And with you by my side, I am guaranteed to taste sweet, sweet Sisterhooves Social victory! Go, Apples, go, go, go, Apples go!"
Brotherhooves Social,Dave Polsky,applejack,"Uh, Apple Bloom? I think Big Mac's got somethin' he wants to show you."
Brotherhooves Social,Dave Polsky,apple bloom,"Oh, hey. Is that the toy we used to play with when I was little?"
Brotherhooves Social,Dave Polsky,big mcintosh,Eeyup!
Brotherhooves Social,Dave Polsky,apple bloom,"Neat. [to Applejack] Alright then! Let's get back to practicin'! One more run-through of our jugglin' routine, make sure our harmonies are tight in our song, and see if we can't beat our best pie-eatin' time!"
Brotherhooves Social,Dave Polsky,applejack,"Hold on, sugarcube. I need a minute to talk with Big Mac."
Brotherhooves Social,Dave Polsky,apple bloom,Mind if I go ahead and start eatin' this pie?!
Brotherhooves Social,Dave Polsky,applejack,"Hey, Big Mac, you all right?"
Brotherhooves Social,Dave Polsky,big mcintosh,[sighs] Yup.
Brotherhooves Social,Dave Polsky,applejack,You sure? You seemed a little down back there.
Brotherhooves Social,Dave Polsky,big mcintosh,[scoffs] Nope.
Brotherhooves Social,Dave Polsky,applejack,"Come on, you can tell me. You feelin' a little left out? Apple Bloom and I have been spendin' a lot of time together gettin' ready for the Social."
Brotherhooves Social,Dave Polsky,applejack,[gasps] What in the...?
Brotherhooves Social,Dave Polsky,apple bloom,"Your cutie mark! You're being summoned, Applejack! This is so cool!"
Brotherhooves Social,Dave Polsky,big mcintosh,[sighs] Eeyup.
Brotherhooves Social,Dave Polsky,applejack,Now calm down. Let me just go over to Twilight's castle and see what's what! Maybe it's just a false alarm.
Brotherhooves Social,Dave Polsky,apple bloom,But you said it was a false alarm!
Brotherhooves Social,Dave Polsky,applejack,"I said maybe it's a false alarm. Well, it's not. Rarity and I have to go to Manehattan."
Brotherhooves Social,Dave Polsky,apple bloom,Can't you just tell that map it'll have to wait a couple days?
Brotherhooves Social,Dave Polsky,applejack,"No can do, sugarcube. When duty calls, I gotta answer right away. What kind of an example would I be settin' for my little sister if I didn't?"
Brotherhooves Social,Dave Polsky,apple bloom,This can't be happening! Your extreme awesomeness is backfiring on me!
Brotherhooves Social,Dave Polsky,applejack,"[sighs] I'm sorry, Apple Bloom. [to Big Mac] Try and cheer her up, won't you?"
Brotherhooves Social,Dave Polsky,big mcintosh,Eeyup.
Brotherhooves Social,Dave Polsky,granny smith,"Breakfast, come and get it!"
Brotherhooves Social,Dave Polsky,granny smith,"Oh, it's no use, Big Mac. If I know my Apple Bloom, she won't come out of a funk this funky 'til her big sister gets back."
Brotherhooves Social,Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,"Hey, Apple Bloom, the Social's gonna start in a few hours. Thought you might want to go with us."
Brotherhooves Social,Dave Polsky,scootaloo,"Since Rarity and Applejack are out of town, you and Sweetie Belle can cheer on me and Rainbow Dash instead!"
Brotherhooves Social,Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,Pretty great they're letting you participate even though you're not technically sisters.
Brotherhooves Social,Dave Polsky,granny smith,"Well, the Social's always had a pretty loose definition of what consti-ma-tutes a sister. As long as you share a bond that represents the spirit of the Social, you're in!"
Brotherhooves Social,Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,So what do you say?
Brotherhooves Social,Dave Polsky,scootaloo,You coming?
Brotherhooves Social,Dave Polsky,apple bloom,Why not...? Got nothin' better to do... Lemme wash up and I'll meet you in a little bit.
Brotherhooves Social,Dave Polsky,granny smith,"[sighs] Such a shame we don't live closer to all your second cousins. You could maybe do the Social with one of them instead. What is it, Big Mac? Y'all got an idea?"
Brotherhooves Social,Dave Polsky,big mcintosh,Eeyup!
Brotherhooves Social,Dave Polsky,apple bloom,What? What is it?!
Brotherhooves Social,Dave Polsky,scootaloo,Today is our big day!
Brotherhooves Social,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,We have so got this. I'm gonna go sign us in.
Brotherhooves Social,Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,I guess I'm just a little jealous you two get to compete and I don't. But at least I get to be here and cheer you on! I thought Apple Bloom was gonna be here too.
Brotherhooves Social,Dave Polsky,scootaloo,"Guess she changed her mind. Hey, there you are! You ready to cheer on me and Rainbow Dash to victory?"
Brotherhooves Social,Dave Polsky,apple bloom,"Uh, not exactly. Seems I'm gonna get to participate after all."
Brotherhooves Social,Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,[gasps] Applejack is back from Manehattan already? That must mean Rarity is back too!
Brotherhooves Social,Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,Your cousin who what now?
Brotherhooves Social,Dave Polsky,big mcintosh,"Oh, my! I'm so delighted to meet your little friends, Apple Bloom. Would these be your dear and beloved Cutie Mark Crusaders?"
Brotherhooves Social,Dave Polsky,apple bloom,"[sighs] Sweetie Belle and Scootaloo, cousin Orchard Blossom."
Brotherhooves Social,Dave Polsky,big mcintosh,It is my extra-ordinary pleasure to make your acquaintance.
Brotherhooves Social,Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,[deadpan] That's Big Mac in a dress.
Brotherhooves Social,Dave Polsky,big mcintosh,"Big Mac? Why, as charmed as I am that you find me in the slightest resemblance to such a-a-a fine and noble product of the Apple clan. I am astonished in equal measure. However, I shall take this startling observation under advisement given that it's from such an astute and perceptive filly as yourself, Sweetie Belle."
Brotherhooves Social,Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,"That's awful nice of you to say, cousin Orchard Blossom! I've been told before I'm pretty observant."
Brotherhooves Social,Dave Polsky,big mcintosh,I haven't the slightest doubt.
Brotherhooves Social,Dave Polsky,big mcintosh,"Pardon me. My dearest cousin Applejack is regrettably unable to be here as planned, so I, her cousin Orchard Blossom, will accompany Apple Bloom in her stead. I trust that's acceptable to all concerned?"
Brotherhooves Social,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,"Cousin Orchard Blossom, huh? I know Applejack has a lot of relatives, but I feel like she would've mentioned you."
Brotherhooves Social,Dave Polsky,big mcintosh,"Why, you must be Rainbow Dash. You're Scootaloo's... say... how are y'all related again?"
Brotherhooves Social,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,Hm. Why don't I just let you finish signing in? [hushed] But don't think me and Scootaloo are gonna take it easy on you just 'cause you're a stallion!
Brotherhooves Social,Dave Polsky,big mcintosh,"[laughs] Now, where were we?"
Brotherhooves Social,Dave Polsky,big mcintosh,"[tuts] You mean 'powder your muzzle', don't you, dear? Such a more, uh, feminine-like reference to nature's call, don't you agree?"
Brotherhooves Social,Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,Have they called your brother's bluff yet?
Brotherhooves Social,Dave Polsky,apple bloom,"No, but they're about to! I can't bear to watch!"
Brotherhooves Social,Dave Polsky,big mcintosh,"Yoo-hoo! Apple Bloom! They've approved us as a pair! [giggles] Hurry along now, precious!"
Brotherhooves Social,Dave Polsky,apple bloom,I can't believe they bought it!
Brotherhooves Social,Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,"It's sweet he wants to help you out like this. Weird, but sweet."
Brotherhooves Social,Dave Polsky,big mcintosh,"Here we are! This one, please."
Brotherhooves Social,Dave Polsky,apple bloom,[hushed] You sure you know all the words? 'Cause it took Applejack a pretty long time to get it down.
Brotherhooves Social,Dave Polsky,big mcintosh,[hushed] Did it now?
Brotherhooves Social,Dave Polsky,apple bloom,Sisterhood
Brotherhooves Social,Dave Polsky,big mcintosh,Sisterhood
Brotherhooves Social,Dave Polsky,apple bloom,Is a special kind of friend Sisterhood
Brotherhooves Social,Dave Polsky,big mcintosh,Sisterhood
Brotherhooves Social,Dave Polsky,apple bloom,Is a bond that never ends
Brotherhooves Social,Dave Polsky,big mcintosh,Sisterhood
Brotherhooves Social,Dave Polsky,apple bloom,Sisterhood
Brotherhooves Social,Dave Polsky,big mcintosh,Sisterhood
Brotherhooves Social,Dave Polsky,apple bloom,Sisterhood
Brotherhooves Social,Dave Polsky,big mcintosh,Sisterhood
Brotherhooves Social,Dave Polsky,apple bloom,Sisterhood
Brotherhooves Social,Dave Polsky,big mcintosh,[deep bass] Sisterhood!
Brotherhooves Social,Dave Polsky,apple bloom,[joining in] ...ood
Brotherhooves Social,Dave Polsky,big mcintosh,"Just a frog in my throat, dear. Probably just need to get a sip of water. If you'll excuse us, we've another event in which to participate. Oh, my, that certainly didn't go as I had planned. But don't you worry. We'll get you a blue ribbon yet, Apple Bloom."
Brotherhooves Social,Dave Polsky,apple bloom,You sure about that?
Brotherhooves Social,Dave Polsky,big mcintosh,As sure as my name is cousin Orchard Blossom.
Brotherhooves Social,Dave Polsky,apple bloom,[to herself] But that isn't your name!
Brotherhooves Social,Dave Polsky,big mcintosh,Whee!
Brotherhooves Social,Dave Polsky,apple bloom,Whoaaa!
Brotherhooves Social,Dave Polsky,apple bloom,[spits] Yay.
Brotherhooves Social,Dave Polsky,big mcintosh,"Oh, I don't know why I didn't choose to wear something more casual. Why, I knew that juggling routine like the back of my hoof! But never you mind. There is still the race to be run!"
Brotherhooves Social,Dave Polsky,apple bloom,"I really appreciate all the effort, Big Ma<U+0097> cousin Orchard Blossom, but maybe we just skip the whole obstacle course thing and call it a day."
Brotherhooves Social,Dave Polsky,big mcintosh,"Why, Apple Bloom! I wouldn't hear of it! Your cousin Orchard Blossom may be many things, but she is not a quitter."
Brotherhooves Social,Dave Polsky,apple bloom,"I'm sure she's not, but it's like Applejack said! There'll be more Sisterhooves Socials down the line, and I'm sure she'll help me get a blue ribbon next time around."
Brotherhooves Social,Dave Polsky,big mcintosh,"B-But you wanted to win it this Sisterhooves Social! And no matter what, I am gonna get you that win! Why, I simply have to."
Brotherhooves Social,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,"Alright, Scootaloo, remember the parts where teamwork really comes into play!"
Brotherhooves Social,Dave Polsky,scootaloo,How could I forget? We've been training all week!
Brotherhooves Social,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,"Okay, hot stuff! What's our move on the grape squish?"
Brotherhooves Social,Dave Polsky,scootaloo,The alley-oop.
Brotherhooves Social,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,Apple toss?
Brotherhooves Social,Dave Polsky,scootaloo,Flip-flop.
Brotherhooves Social,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,Egg carrying?
Brotherhooves Social,Dave Polsky,scootaloo,Flutter-bomb.
Brotherhooves Social,Dave Polsky,big mcintosh,"Oh, dear."
Brotherhooves Social,Dave Polsky,granny smith,[through megaphone] Competi-sis-tors! Take your positions!
Brotherhooves Social,Dave Polsky,granny smith,"[through megaphone] And a-ready, and a-set, go!"
Brotherhooves Social,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,"Nice jump, Scoot!"
Brotherhooves Social,Dave Polsky,apple bloom,Woo-hoo!
Brotherhooves Social,Dave Polsky,apple bloom,Yikes! You almost squished me!
Brotherhooves Social,Dave Polsky,big mcintosh,"Pick up those hooves, Apple Bloom! Why, you're barely movin' at a mosey!"
Brotherhooves Social,Dave Polsky,big mcintosh,"Come on, junebug, it's... like you've never carried an egg before!"
Brotherhooves Social,Dave Polsky,apple bloom,Argh! I'm goin' as fast as I can!
Brotherhooves Social,Dave Polsky,big mcintosh,Woo-hoo!
Brotherhooves Social,Dave Polsky,big mcintosh,"[coughs] I mean, [clears throat] victory is ours, sweet Apple Bloom!"
Brotherhooves Social,Dave Polsky,big mcintosh,Uh-oh.
Brotherhooves Social,Dave Polsky,apple bloom,I should've known you'd eventually get busted for bein' a stallion!
Brotherhooves Social,Dave Polsky,rainbow dash,"Hah! Looks like we win, squirt!"
Brotherhooves Social,Dave Polsky,scootaloo,Woo-hoo! Yeah!
Brotherhooves Social,Dave Polsky,apple bloom,I told you I should've just waited until the next Social to win with Applejack.
Brotherhooves Social,Dave Polsky,apple bloom,"You know I'm... not mad, right?"
Brotherhooves Social,Dave Polsky,big mcintosh,Eeyup.
Brotherhooves Social,Dave Polsky,apple bloom,I mean... let's face it <U+0096> you dressin' up as my cousin Orchard Blossom was a pretty crazy idea in the first place.
Brotherhooves Social,Dave Polsky,big mcintosh,Eeyup.
Brotherhooves Social,Dave Polsky,apple bloom,And it's not like you got me disqualified from the Social forever or anythin'. I can participate next time with Applejack. Everything's fine.
Brotherhooves Social,Dave Polsky,big mcintosh,Eeyup.
Brotherhooves Social,Dave Polsky,apple bloom,"I just don't understand why you went so crazy there at the end of the race. I mean, I know you like to win an' all, but... you wanna tell me what's goin' on?"
Brotherhooves Social,Dave Polsky,big mcintosh,Nope.
Brotherhooves Social,Dave Polsky,apple bloom,"Alright. Well, it's getting late. You comin'?"
Brotherhooves Social,Dave Polsky,big mcintosh,Nope.
Brotherhooves Social,Dave Polsky,apple bloom,"Okay. See you later, I guess..."
Brotherhooves Social,Dave Polsky,big mcintosh,Apple Bloom?
Brotherhooves Social,Dave Polsky,apple bloom,Yeah?
Brotherhooves Social,Dave Polsky,big mcintosh,"When you were little, you used to look up to me, thought I was the best thing since zap apple jam. Things are different now. Applejack's the hero of the Apple family, always rushin' off to save Equestria. And I'm just here on the farm, doin' chores, helpin' out the way I can, nothin' special, nobody's hero. I guess I just thought... oh, never mind. Here I am about to start blabberin' on about my feelin's. You don't wanna hear all this."
Brotherhooves Social,Dave Polsky,apple bloom,"Yes, I do!"
Brotherhooves Social,Dave Polsky,big mcintosh,"I guess I just thought if I could... fill in for Applejack at the Social and get you a blue ribbon, well, I could be somepony you looked up to again. Be your hero again. Even if it was for just a day. It was foolish and I'm ashamed. Please, I just wanna be alone right now."
Brotherhooves Social,Dave Polsky,apple bloom,"Yeah, well, too bad, you big goof! 'Cause I'm not goin' anywhere. And I know that you're always gonna be here when I need you. Heck, you'll do a whole obstacle course in high heels if you think it'll help me get somethin' I want. You're my big brother. You've always been a hero to me, Big Mac, and you always will be. I'm real sorry I haven't been lettin' you know that's how I feel. Guess both of us have been holdin' back when it comes to expressin' ourselves, huh?"
Brotherhooves Social,Dave Polsky,big mcintosh,Eeyup.
Brotherhooves Social,Dave Polsky,granny smith,Big Mac! Apple Bloom! Your sister's home! She says she's got quite a story to tell about her trip to Manehattan!
Brotherhooves Social,Dave Polsky,apple bloom,"Be there in a bit! I'm spending some quality time with my big brother! [to Big Mac] Hey, Big Mac?"
Brotherhooves Social,Dave Polsky,big mcintosh,Eeyup?
Brotherhooves Social,Dave Polsky,apple bloom,How do you think cousin Orchard Blossom would describe this sunset?
Brotherhooves Social,Dave Polsky,big mcintosh,"[chuckles] Why, dear, I do declare this is the most beautiful sunset my eyes have ever looked upon. Though sitting here on these tree roots is a trifle uncomfortable for my hindquarters."
Crusaders of the Lost Mark,Amy Keating Rogers,apple bloom,"Okay, Crusaders! Back to the business of earnin' our cutie marks! Any suggestions?"
Crusaders of the Lost Mark,Amy Keating Rogers,scootaloo,"No, we've tried everything!"
Crusaders of the Lost Mark,Amy Keating Rogers,sweetie belle,We've run out of ideas.
Crusaders of the Lost Mark,Amy Keating Rogers,apple bloom,"Are you kiddin' me, Crusaders? We can do better than that!"
Crusaders of the Lost Mark,Amy Keating Rogers,apple bloom,We've been searchin' for our cutie marks For a while now Tryin' to find out how we fit in
Crusaders of the Lost Mark,Amy Keating Rogers,cutie mark crusaders,'Cause the Cutie Mark Crusaders don't give in
Crusaders of the Lost Mark,Amy Keating Rogers,apple bloom,"Now, that's more like it!"
Crusaders of the Lost Mark,Amy Keating Rogers,pipsqueak,Cutie Mark Crusaders! Help!
Crusaders of the Lost Mark,Amy Keating Rogers,apple bloom,"What's wrong, Pipsqueak?"
Crusaders of the Lost Mark,Amy Keating Rogers,pipsqueak,"I'm running for student pony president, I was hoping you three would be my campaign managers!"
Crusaders of the Lost Mark,Amy Keating Rogers,apple bloom,"We've never tried gettin' our cutie marks in campaign managin'! What do ya say, Crusaders?"
Crusaders of the Lost Mark,Amy Keating Rogers,cutie mark crusaders,Yeah! Hoof!
Crusaders of the Lost Mark,Amy Keating Rogers,apple bloom,"[loudly] So, Pip, how would you help the school if you were elected student pony president?"
Crusaders of the Lost Mark,Amy Keating Rogers,pipsqueak,Our playground equipment took quite a beating during Twilight's battle with Tirek!
Crusaders of the Lost Mark,Amy Keating Rogers,pipsqueak,"If I'm voted in as student pony president, I'll go to the school board and right this wrong!"
Crusaders of the Lost Mark,Amy Keating Rogers,diamond tiara,"Well, I think that's a ridiculous waste of money! It's just like when Twist proposed to repair the window that Discord destroyed! She just wanted to repair it like a plain old schoolhouse window. But you all know voting for me was the best choice because I convinced the school board to give that window visual appeal!"
Crusaders of the Lost Mark,Amy Keating Rogers,apple bloom,"'Course, it doesn't hurt that her mother Spoiled Rich is president of the school board."
Crusaders of the Lost Mark,Amy Keating Rogers,silver spoon,"Exactly! Which is why when Diamond Tiara is voted student pony president, the school will be putting a statue of her in the center of our schoolyard!"
Crusaders of the Lost Mark,Amy Keating Rogers,diamond tiara,[through gritted teeth] Silver Spoon! That was my big announcement for when I won!
Crusaders of the Lost Mark,Amy Keating Rogers,silver spoon,I was only trying to help.
Crusaders of the Lost Mark,Amy Keating Rogers,diamond tiara,[through gritted teeth] I don't need that kind of help!
Crusaders of the Lost Mark,Amy Keating Rogers,apple bloom,Haven't we all had enough of Diamond Tiara?
Crusaders of the Lost Mark,Amy Keating Rogers,scootaloo,Do we really need a big statue of her?
Crusaders of the Lost Mark,Amy Keating Rogers,sweetie belle,Especially where our playground equipment should be?
Crusaders of the Lost Mark,Amy Keating Rogers,pipsqueak,A vote for Pip is a vote for the playground!
Crusaders of the Lost Mark,Amy Keating Rogers,diamond tiara,A vote for Diamond Tiara is a vote for more Diamond Tiara!
Crusaders of the Lost Mark,Amy Keating Rogers,cutie mark crusaders,It's time to make a change This is our chance Don't be afraid to do what's right He's it! Vote for Pip!
Crusaders of the Lost Mark,Amy Keating Rogers,diamond tiara,"I don't believe what I am hearing I'm the only one you should be cheering Pipsqueak? Try ""Pip's weak!"" Don't you think?"
Crusaders of the Lost Mark,Amy Keating Rogers,apple bloom,We'll let the votin' decide!
Crusaders of the Lost Mark,Amy Keating Rogers,diamond tiara,Everypony has their little secrets
Crusaders of the Lost Mark,Amy Keating Rogers,apple bloom,"Come on now, ponies! Don't listen to her!"
Crusaders of the Lost Mark,Amy Keating Rogers,cutie mark crusaders,You've gotta vote for change It's time for a new leader End all the tyranny Vote now and we can beat her
Crusaders of the Lost Mark,Amy Keating Rogers,cutie mark crusaders,Our victory is in sight
Crusaders of the Lost Mark,Amy Keating Rogers,diamond tiara,"Stop! Everypony who hasn't voted, listen up!"
Crusaders of the Lost Mark,Amy Keating Rogers,silver spoon,I've a tiny suggestion That you should be aware You could probably win this election If you show them all you real<U+0097>
Crusaders of the Lost Mark,Amy Keating Rogers,diamond tiara,I don't recall asking you to speak!
Crusaders of the Lost Mark,Amy Keating Rogers,sweetie belle,"Well, if that's how you treat your best friend, then I choose Pipsqueak!"
Crusaders of the Lost Mark,Amy Keating Rogers,cutie mark crusaders,It's time for a new leader It's time to make a change We're here to fight for what we believe
Crusaders of the Lost Mark,Amy Keating Rogers,cutie mark crusaders,It's finally time we beat her And play a better game 'Cause when we vote together There's nothing that we can't achieve
Crusaders of the Lost Mark,Amy Keating Rogers,cheerilee,The votes have been counted! The student pony president is... Pipsqueak!
Crusaders of the Lost Mark,Amy Keating Rogers,diamond tiara,Huh?!
Crusaders of the Lost Mark,Amy Keating Rogers,apple bloom,"Oh, my gosh, Crusaders! Pip won!"
Crusaders of the Lost Mark,Amy Keating Rogers,pipsqueak,"I couldn't have won without the hard work of my campaign managers, the Cutie Mark Crusaders!"
Crusaders of the Lost Mark,Amy Keating Rogers,sweetie belle,Campaign manager cutie marks!
Crusaders of the Lost Mark,Amy Keating Rogers,diamond tiara,"Guess you're not as good as you thought, blank flanks! In fact, I demand a recount!"
Crusaders of the Lost Mark,Amy Keating Rogers,cheerilee,"Trust me, Diamond Tiara. Pip won."
Crusaders of the Lost Mark,Amy Keating Rogers,diamond tiara,"I'll be the judge of that, Miss Cheerilee!"
Crusaders of the Lost Mark,Amy Keating Rogers,diamond tiara,What?! One vote! Silver Spoon! You didn't vote for me?!
Crusaders of the Lost Mark,Amy Keating Rogers,silver spoon,"No, I didn't."
Crusaders of the Lost Mark,Amy Keating Rogers,diamond tiara,But you're my best friend!
Crusaders of the Lost Mark,Amy Keating Rogers,silver spoon,"Am I? 'Cause I tried to help by mentioning your 'surprise' statue, and suddenly I wasn't even allowed to speak! You could have actually won this election if you just listened to me. You wanna know how? [whispering] Sorry. I'm not allowed to speak."
Crusaders of the Lost Mark,Amy Keating Rogers,silver spoon,[to Cutie Mark Crusaders and Pipsqueak] What? I don't have to follow her drum any more.
Crusaders of the Lost Mark,Amy Keating Rogers,apple bloom,"I know Diamond Tiara's been pretty awful, but... we should probably make sure she's okay. Just 'cause she's never cared about anypony else's feelings doesn't mean we shouldn't care about hers."
Crusaders of the Lost Mark,Amy Keating Rogers,diamond tiara,Because... I didn't win.
Crusaders of the Lost Mark,Amy Keating Rogers,diamond tiara,Sorry mother.
Crusaders of the Lost Mark,Amy Keating Rogers,fancy pants,Hm.
Crusaders of the Lost Mark,Amy Keating Rogers,diamond tiara,If I'm a diamond Then why do I feel so rough? I'm as strong as a stone Even that's not enough
Crusaders of the Lost Mark,Amy Keating Rogers,sweetie belle,Is it weird that I feel bad for her?
Crusaders of the Lost Mark,Amy Keating Rogers,scootaloo,"If it is, then... I'm weird, too."
Crusaders of the Lost Mark,Amy Keating Rogers,apple bloom,"She wants to change, but she doesn't know how."
Crusaders of the Lost Mark,Amy Keating Rogers,sweetie belle,Seems like she could use a friend or two to help her figure it out.
Crusaders of the Lost Mark,Amy Keating Rogers,apple bloom,"Hey, Diamond Tiara! Wait up!"
Crusaders of the Lost Mark,Amy Keating Rogers,diamond tiara,What do you three want? To gloat? Rub in my defeat?
Crusaders of the Lost Mark,Amy Keating Rogers,apple bloom,"Actually, we wanted to invite you to our clubhouse to hang out."
Crusaders of the Lost Mark,Amy Keating Rogers,diamond tiara,Really?
Crusaders of the Lost Mark,Amy Keating Rogers,scootaloo,"Yeah, for real!"
Crusaders of the Lost Mark,Amy Keating Rogers,diamond tiara,"Well, thanks to you all, I don't have any important class president business to attend to or anything. So I might as well."
Crusaders of the Lost Mark,Amy Keating Rogers,sweetie belle,That sounds like a yes...
Crusaders of the Lost Mark,Amy Keating Rogers,diamond tiara,"So, do you three just sit around here plotting out different ways to try and get your cutie marks?"
Crusaders of the Lost Mark,Amy Keating Rogers,apple bloom,"Actually, yeah."
Crusaders of the Lost Mark,Amy Keating Rogers,diamond tiara,You three are... really lucky.
Crusaders of the Lost Mark,Amy Keating Rogers,cutie mark crusaders,We are?!
Crusaders of the Lost Mark,Amy Keating Rogers,diamond tiara,"Yeah! You get to explore all these options, learning who you really are before you're stuck with something you don't understand."
Crusaders of the Lost Mark,Amy Keating Rogers,apple bloom,"But... you've done that, right?"
Crusaders of the Lost Mark,Amy Keating Rogers,diamond tiara,"Yeah, 'cause I have my cutie mark! And I'm not struggling at all to figure out who I'm supposed to be and what I'm supposed to be doing with this mark that's already on my flank!"
Crusaders of the Lost Mark,Amy Keating Rogers,apple bloom,Uh... are you sure about that?
Crusaders of the Lost Mark,Amy Keating Rogers,diamond tiara,[scoffs] That's a weird question.
Crusaders of the Lost Mark,Amy Keating Rogers,sweetie belle,"Not really, since we kind of overheard you yesterday."
Crusaders of the Lost Mark,Amy Keating Rogers,diamond tiara,Were you trying to get your cutie mark in spying? Is that on your little chart?
Crusaders of the Lost Mark,Amy Keating Rogers,sweetie belle,"No! We were just worried about you when you lost the election, and then you lost your friend, and then your mom yelled at you..."
Crusaders of the Lost Mark,Amy Keating Rogers,apple bloom,"We know you wanna change, and we think we can<U+0097>"
Crusaders of the Lost Mark,Amy Keating Rogers,pipsqueak,[muffled] Help!
Crusaders of the Lost Mark,Amy Keating Rogers,pipsqueak,Cutie Mark Crusaders! I was at the school board meeting and they didn't approve my request for the new playground equipment!
Crusaders of the Lost Mark,Amy Keating Rogers,sweetie belle,Why not?
Crusaders of the Lost Mark,Amy Keating Rogers,pipsqueak,"There's no money in the budget! So I checked my Peggy bank to see if I had enough bits, but my little Peggy wasn't nearly full enough!"
Crusaders of the Lost Mark,Amy Keating Rogers,sweetie belle,"Don't worry, Pip!"
Crusaders of the Lost Mark,Amy Keating Rogers,scootaloo,We'll meet you back at school.
Crusaders of the Lost Mark,Amy Keating Rogers,apple bloom,And help you find a solution!
Crusaders of the Lost Mark,Amy Keating Rogers,pipsqueak,"Thanks, Cutie Mark Crusaders!"
Crusaders of the Lost Mark,Amy Keating Rogers,diamond tiara,"Oh, I already have a solution! Our new student pony president is gonna be kicked out of office, and I'll be reinstated!"
Crusaders of the Lost Mark,Amy Keating Rogers,scootaloo,Where's she going?
Crusaders of the Lost Mark,Amy Keating Rogers,apple bloom,Where do you think?! C'mon! After her!
Crusaders of the Lost Mark,Amy Keating Rogers,sweetie belle,Wait! I'm coming too!
Crusaders of the Lost Mark,Amy Keating Rogers,diamond tiara,"Cutie Mark Crusaders, get out of my way Those ponies need to know the truth And they'll hear it from me"
Crusaders of the Lost Mark,Amy Keating Rogers,cutie mark crusaders,"Stop! Diamond Tiara, this is not the way You know you're better than this hostility"
Crusaders of the Lost Mark,Amy Keating Rogers,diamond tiara,You don't even know me at all Don't understand the meaning of my fall What my family would think if I ever Fail at anything
Crusaders of the Lost Mark,Amy Keating Rogers,cutie mark crusaders,"Stop! This is not the answer Wait! And it's plainly seen Listen! You can redeem yourself But by helping others, not by being mean"
Crusaders of the Lost Mark,Amy Keating Rogers,diamond tiara,"Everypony, I have an announcement!"
Crusaders of the Lost Mark,Amy Keating Rogers,apple bloom,Diamond Tiara! Think hard about the choice you're makin' right now!
Crusaders of the Lost Mark,Amy Keating Rogers,scootaloo,You can be a better pony!
Crusaders of the Lost Mark,Amy Keating Rogers,diamond tiara,"No, mother!"
Crusaders of the Lost Mark,Amy Keating Rogers,diamond tiara,"You've spent your life acting like a high horse and raised me to follow in your hoofprints! At first I thought this was fine, but then I finally realized I wanted something you don't have <U+0096> friends!"
Crusaders of the Lost Mark,Amy Keating Rogers,diamond tiara,"These are the Cutie Mark Crusaders, and they are my friends! You need to stop calling them such mean and hurtful names! They are working harder to get their cutie marks than anypony I've ever seen! And they will get them exactly when they discover their true talent, which I guarantee will be amazing! Now, will you please deliver this to father?"
Crusaders of the Lost Mark,Amy Keating Rogers,diamond tiara,"I have to thank you, Crusaders. Obviously I've known since I got my cutie mark that my talent is getting other ponies to do what I want. I just asked my father if he could donate the money for the new playground equipment!"
Crusaders of the Lost Mark,Amy Keating Rogers,diamond tiara,"[to Pipsqueak] I knew you were worried for a second there, weren't you? Ha! Well, I think it's all gonna work out just fine, Mister President!"
Crusaders of the Lost Mark,Amy Keating Rogers,diamond tiara,We'll build a playground For all of us to enjoy So full of games There's enough for each girl and boy
Crusaders of the Lost Mark,Amy Keating Rogers,apple bloom,"I've been thinkin', Crusaders. We spend an awful lot of time fussin' and frettin' tryin' to discover our true talent. But when we take a little time off, we end up helpin' other ponies figure out their true talent!"
Crusaders of the Lost Mark,Amy Keating Rogers,sweetie belle,"Yeah, and I think that's way more important than worrying about our cutie marks, don't you?"
Crusaders of the Lost Mark,Amy Keating Rogers,scootaloo,Absolutely! I don't care if I ever get my cutie mark as long as I get to hang out with my best friends.
Crusaders of the Lost Mark,Amy Keating Rogers,apple bloom,"So what do you say, Crusaders? Want to just focus on helpin' others find their cutie marks?"
Crusaders of the Lost Mark,Amy Keating Rogers,sweetie belle,What happened?
Crusaders of the Lost Mark,Amy Keating Rogers,apple bloom,What's goin' on?
Crusaders of the Lost Mark,Amy Keating Rogers,diamond tiara,It's your cutie marks! They're amazing!
Crusaders of the Lost Mark,Amy Keating Rogers,cutie mark crusaders,We all got the same cutie mark! Cutie Mark Crusaders forever!
Crusaders of the Lost Mark,Amy Keating Rogers,cutie mark crusaders,We were searching for our cutie marks For a while there Trying to find out how we fit in
Crusaders of the Lost Mark,Amy Keating Rogers,scootaloo,Now we know what it took all along
Crusaders of the Lost Mark,Amy Keating Rogers,sweetie belle,And our journey here is never really done
Crusaders of the Lost Mark,Amy Keating Rogers,apple bloom,For it is more than just a mark It's a place for us to start

Crusaders of the Lost Mark,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,Now go on and party with your pals.
Crusaders of the Lost Mark,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,"I'm so proud of you, little buddy You've taught me a thing or two"
Crusaders of the Lost Mark,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,You've inspired everypony around you And you've inspired me too
Crusaders of the Lost Mark,Amy Keating Rogers,apple bloom,"Well, what do you think, Crusaders? Were these cutie marks totally worth waiting for or what?"
Crusaders of the Lost Mark,Amy Keating Rogers,sweetie belle,Yeah! I can't wait to see who we're gonna help next!
Crusaders of the Lost Mark,Amy Keating Rogers,cutie mark crusaders,We started out just three Crusaders driven to see What we find in our hearts Discover our destiny
The One Where Pinkie Pie Knows,Gillian M. Berrow,pinkie pie,"Five hundred and sixty-six, five hundred and sixty-seven, five hundred and sixty-eight... Phew! Look at that, Pound Cake! I am so close to breaking my personal cupcake-icing record!"
The One Where Pinkie Pie Knows,Gillian M. Berrow,mrs. cake,Mrs. My goodness! I can't believe what I'm seeing here!
The One Where Pinkie Pie Knows,Gillian M. Berrow,pinkie pie,Pretty impressive if I do say so myself.
The One Where Pinkie Pie Knows,Gillian M. Berrow,mrs. cake,"Mrs. Pinkie, would you mind watching the counter while I pop to the supply room? We've just received a very special order, and the ingredients need to be perfect."
The One Where Pinkie Pie Knows,Gillian M. Berrow,pinkie pie,Okie-dokie-lokie.
The One Where Pinkie Pie Knows,Gillian M. Berrow,mrs. cake,"Mrs. Thanks, dear!"
The One Where Pinkie Pie Knows,Gillian M. Berrow,pinkie pie,A baby?! Shining Armor and Princess Cadance are having a baby?! [squeals] This is the best news ever! I can't wait to tell Twilight!
The One Where Pinkie Pie Knows,Gillian M. Berrow,mrs. cake,"Mrs. Oh, em, Pinkie, uh... [whispers] it's a top secret surprise."
The One Where Pinkie Pie Knows,Gillian M. Berrow,pinkie pie,A top secret surprise?! That means I have to keep the exciting news... [gulps] ...to myself!
The One Where Pinkie Pie Knows,Gillian M. Berrow,pinkie pie,"Even though I didn't technically make a Pinkie Promise to Mrs. Cake, I can't tell Twilight or anypony the big news! That would make me a... a... a big old surprise ruiner! Right, Gummy?"
The One Where Pinkie Pie Knows,Gillian M. Berrow,pinkie pie,Did you take that from Pound Cake again? Don't you know it's wrong to steal from a baby?
The One Where Pinkie Pie Knows,Gillian M. Berrow,rarity,What's all this about a baby?
The One Where Pinkie Pie Knows,Gillian M. Berrow,pinkie pie,What? Who? What? Who said something about a baby?!
The One Where Pinkie Pie Knows,Gillian M. Berrow,rarity,"You did, Ms. Pie, just now. What were you talking about?"
The One Where Pinkie Pie Knows,Gillian M. Berrow,twilight sparkle,"Great! Everypony's here. Now I don't have to wait any longer to tell you all the wonderful news! Somepony special is coming to visit Ponyville, and I need your help getting everything ready!"
The One Where Pinkie Pie Knows,Gillian M. Berrow,twilight sparkle,It's...
The One Where Pinkie Pie Knows,Gillian M. Berrow,twilight sparkle,"Yes, and they're coming<U+0097>"
The One Where Pinkie Pie Knows,Gillian M. Berrow,twilight sparkle,"Yes, on the<U+0097>"
The One Where Pinkie Pie Knows,Gillian M. Berrow,twilight sparkle,Yes.
The One Where Pinkie Pie Knows,Gillian M. Berrow,pinkie pie,Annnnnd?
The One Where Pinkie Pie Knows,Gillian M. Berrow,twilight sparkle,And that's it.
The One Where Pinkie Pie Knows,Gillian M. Berrow,pinkie pie,Oh.
The One Where Pinkie Pie Knows,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,"Uh, how did you know all that?"
The One Where Pinkie Pie Knows,Gillian M. Berrow,pinkie pie,[nervous laugh] Uh... Pinkie Sense?
The One Where Pinkie Pie Knows,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,"So, you said you needed our help with something?"
The One Where Pinkie Pie Knows,Gillian M. Berrow,twilight sparkle,Follow me.
The One Where Pinkie Pie Knows,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,Sweet posters! Is that Smash Fortune?
The One Where Pinkie Pie Knows,Gillian M. Berrow,twilight sparkle,"It sure is! When Shining Armor said he wanted to come to the castle and visit, I started collecting things he liked when he was a colt as a surprise!"
The One Where Pinkie Pie Knows,Gillian M. Berrow,twilight sparkle,I've been so excited that it's been hard to keep it to myself!
The One Where Pinkie Pie Knows,Gillian M. Berrow,pinkie pie,[slightly muffled] I have no idea what that's like!
The One Where Pinkie Pie Knows,Gillian M. Berrow,fluttershy,"Aww, look at the cute little ant farm!"
The One Where Pinkie Pie Knows,Gillian M. Berrow,spike,And check out all these old comic books!
The One Where Pinkie Pie Knows,Gillian M. Berrow,twilight sparkle,Be careful! They're mint-in-bag!
The One Where Pinkie Pie Knows,Gillian M. Berrow,pinkie pie,What's this?
The One Where Pinkie Pie Knows,Gillian M. Berrow,twilight sparkle,This is Brutus Force. Shining Armor used to carry him around like his baby!
The One Where Pinkie Pie Knows,Gillian M. Berrow,rarity,"It is a bit juvenile for castle d<e9>cor, but it is very sweet of you."
The One Where Pinkie Pie Knows,Gillian M. Berrow,fluttershy,I'm sure Shining Armor will love it.
The One Where Pinkie Pie Knows,Gillian M. Berrow,twilight sparkle,"Me, too. But there's a few more things I'd like to add before he gets here, and I could really use a hoof collecting them."
The One Where Pinkie Pie Knows,Gillian M. Berrow,applejack,"Whatever you need, sugarcube, we'll help you get it."
The One Where Pinkie Pie Knows,Gillian M. Berrow,twilight sparkle,"Thanks, everypony! I just can't wait 'til they walk in and see everything!"
The One Where Pinkie Pie Knows,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,Totally understandable. Watching somepony else be surprised with something is almost better than being the one who's getting the surprise!
The One Where Pinkie Pie Knows,Gillian M. Berrow,pinkie pie,"But... eh... what if the surprise is something so incredibly exciting that a pony can't keep it in any longer, and she has to tell the pony standing next to her what it is or she might explode?!"
The One Where Pinkie Pie Knows,Gillian M. Berrow,fluttershy,I would say... no.
The One Where Pinkie Pie Knows,Gillian M. Berrow,rarity,The pony who ruins a surprise for somepony else has to live with that guilt forever!
The One Where Pinkie Pie Knows,Gillian M. Berrow,pinkie pie,[nervous laugh] Gotta bounce!
The One Where Pinkie Pie Knows,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,"So, I know the bar is set pretty high, but does anypony else think Pinkie Pie was acting weirder than usual?"
The One Where Pinkie Pie Knows,Gillian M. Berrow,pinkie pie,"[heavy breathing] Phew, that was close! Too close. I almost spilled the beans. Beans that would be really hard to clean up! I obviously can't be around my friends right now. Or anypony for that matter! Hmmm... That's it! If Shining Armor and Cadance are coming tomorrow, then all I have to do is lock myself in my room away from everypony until they arrive! Then I won't ruin anything!"
The One Where Pinkie Pie Knows,Gillian M. Berrow,mr. cake,"Mr. Oh, good, you're back! Mrs. Cake needs my help, but these deliveries can't wait! I can't thank you enough for agreeing to be my backup delivery pony, Pinkie!"
The One Where Pinkie Pie Knows,Gillian M. Berrow,pinkie pie,I... did?
The One Where Pinkie Pie Knows,Gillian M. Berrow,mr. cake,Mr. Maybe I should hire somepony to be my backup delivery pony.
The One Where Pinkie Pie Knows,Gillian M. Berrow,pinkie pie,I'll do it!
The One Where Pinkie Pie Knows,Gillian M. Berrow,mr. cake,Mr. Really?
The One Where Pinkie Pie Knows,Gillian M. Berrow,pinkie pie,"Sure! There's no possible way that I could ever have anything that might interfere with doing that task, like a gigantic, emotionally exhausting surprise that would make it super hard to be around other ponies."
The One Where Pinkie Pie Knows,Gillian M. Berrow,mr. cake,"Mr. Great! Uh, you're sure you won't change your mind?"
The One Where Pinkie Pie Knows,Gillian M. Berrow,pinkie pie,"No way! Cross my heart and hope to fly, stick a cupcake in my eye!"
The One Where Pinkie Pie Knows,Gillian M. Berrow,pinkie pie,"Oh, yeah. I Pinkie Promised I'd do it. And I never break a Pinkie Promise! Never!"
The One Where Pinkie Pie Knows,Gillian M. Berrow,mr. cake,"Mr. Well, thanks again! You're a real cake-saver!"
The One Where Pinkie Pie Knows,Gillian M. Berrow,pinkie pie,"[deflates, sighs] Hm. Maybe it'll be a quiet day and I can just avoid everypony!"
The One Where Pinkie Pie Knows,Gillian M. Berrow,apple bloom,"Hiya, Pinkie Pie!"
The One Where Pinkie Pie Knows,Gillian M. Berrow,sweetie belle,Heard any good gossip today?
The One Where Pinkie Pie Knows,Gillian M. Berrow,scootaloo,"Yeah, we're bored. Please say you have some interesting news."
The One Where Pinkie Pie Knows,Gillian M. Berrow,pinkie pie,Nope!
The One Where Pinkie Pie Knows,Gillian M. Berrow,fluttershy,You were in such a rush earlier. Twilight wanted me to ask you if you would bring some snacks to the castle for Shining Armor and Cadance's visit.
The One Where Pinkie Pie Knows,Gillian M. Berrow,pinkie pie,Definitely! Got it! Pinkie Promise! Yeah! Heh.
The One Where Pinkie Pie Knows,Gillian M. Berrow,fluttershy,"You know, maybe some baby carrots..."
The One Where Pinkie Pie Knows,Gillian M. Berrow,pinkie pie,[nervous laugh] What did you say?!
The One Where Pinkie Pie Knows,Gillian M. Berrow,fluttershy,Baby carrots! They're Shining Armor's favorite.
The One Where Pinkie Pie Knows,Gillian M. Berrow,pinkie pie,"Mine too! Baby carrots are kinda like big carrots but smaller, kinda like how foals are tiny versions of their parents but smaller and cuter and<U+0097> Albino squirrel!"
The One Where Pinkie Pie Knows,Gillian M. Berrow,fluttershy,Where? Is it Albert?
The One Where Pinkie Pie Knows,Gillian M. Berrow,pinkie pie,It's time to kick this operation into hyper-hoof and avoid all ponies by any means necessary!
The One Where Pinkie Pie Knows,Gillian M. Berrow,pinkie pie,It didn't feel good ignoring my friends like that... Maybe I can tell just one little pony the surprise?
The One Where Pinkie Pie Knows,Gillian M. Berrow,rarity,[with reverb] The pony who ruins a surprise for somepony else has to live with that guilt forever!
The One Where Pinkie Pie Knows,Gillian M. Berrow,pinkie pie,"You're right, spooky-reflection-of-Rarity-that-I-know-is-actually-my-own-imagination. I can't tell anypony at all! [sighs] Then they would tell Twilight, and she wouldn't be surprised, and it would be all my fault."
The One Where Pinkie Pie Knows,Gillian M. Berrow,pinkie pie,"[sighs] Finally, I'm all aloney on my owney."
The One Where Pinkie Pie Knows,Gillian M. Berrow,pinkie pie,"Wow, great idea! I'm starving too! [chewing] [with mouth full] This apple is delicious! [swallows] What are you having, Gummy? Oh, no! It's the list that Twilight helped me make yesterday so I wouldn't forget all of my Pinkie Promises today! And I have three more things to do! Aw, four if you count bringing those snacks to Twilight's castle! I've been getting liberal with those Pinkie Promises lately..."
The One Where Pinkie Pie Knows,Gillian M. Berrow,sweetie belle,Ooh! I want a flamingo!
The One Where Pinkie Pie Knows,Gillian M. Berrow,apple bloom,I want a goldfish!
The One Where Pinkie Pie Knows,Gillian M. Berrow,scootaloo,Surprise me!
The One Where Pinkie Pie Knows,Gillian M. Berrow,scootaloo,Is that a... baby bottle?
The One Where Pinkie Pie Knows,Gillian M. Berrow,pinkie pie,"[screams] No! It's a... a... puppy! Ha ha, woof woof, ha ha! Eh..."

The One Where Pinkie Pie Knows,Gillian M. Berrow,mayor mare,"My, your friends weren't kidding when they said you had a great filing system, Pinkie! You are Ponyville's best kept secret!"
The One Where Pinkie Pie Knows,Gillian M. Berrow,pinkie pie,"No, I'm not!"
The One Where Pinkie Pie Knows,Gillian M. Berrow,mayor mare,"[hushed] Speaking of secrets, have you ever known somepony else's secret?"
The One Where Pinkie Pie Knows,Gillian M. Berrow,pinkie pie,Noooooo...
The One Where Pinkie Pie Knows,Gillian M. Berrow,mayor mare,[hushed] A surprise that was so big and exciting that it was all you could think about?
The One Where Pinkie Pie Knows,Gillian M. Berrow,pinkie pie,Nope!
The One Where Pinkie Pie Knows,Gillian M. Berrow,mayor mare,[strangled sigh] Me neither...

The One Where Pinkie Pie Knows,Gillian M. Berrow,twilight sparkle,"Those look yummy, Pinkie! Let me help you! But we better cover them up so they don't get spoiled."
The One Where Pinkie Pie Knows,Gillian M. Berrow,pinkie pie,Why would they get spoiled? We're all gonna eat them super soon!
The One Where Pinkie Pie Knows,Gillian M. Berrow,applejack,"Oh, didn't anypony tell you? Shining Armor and Cadance are held up. They may not arrive 'til Saturday."
The One Where Pinkie Pie Knows,Gillian M. Berrow,pinkie pie,Whaaaaaaaaaat?! [hyperventilating] You mean... [breathes] I have... [breathes] to wait... [breathes] another whole day?! I don't know if I can!
The One Where Pinkie Pie Knows,Gillian M. Berrow,twilight sparkle,"Pinkie Pie, do you have something you need to say? You seem like you've been keeping something in."
The One Where Pinkie Pie Knows,Gillian M. Berrow,fluttershy,We're here to listen.
The One Where Pinkie Pie Knows,Gillian M. Berrow,applejack,"Well, go on then, sugarcube."
The One Where Pinkie Pie Knows,Gillian M. Berrow,rarity,"We're not going to judge you, darling."
The One Where Pinkie Pie Knows,Gillian M. Berrow,spike,You'll feel so much better once you get it off your chest!

The One Where Pinkie Pie Knows,Gillian M. Berrow,princess cadance,"So did we. Turned out we weren't needed in Maretonia until next week. And the summit we were supposed to attend today had to be rescheduled, so... we got here even sooner than planned!"
The One Where Pinkie Pie Knows,Gillian M. Berrow,shining armor,Surprise!
The One Where Pinkie Pie Knows,Gillian M. Berrow,princess cadance,It's wonderful to see you all again!
The One Where Pinkie Pie Knows,Gillian M. Berrow,applejack,"Well, the pleasure's all ours, Princess."

The One Where Pinkie Pie Knows,Gillian M. Berrow,shining armor,"Oh, yeah?"
The One Where Pinkie Pie Knows,Gillian M. Berrow,shining armor,"[hushed] Lucky we came when we did, huh? I'm guessing you saw the scroll we sent to Mr. and Mrs. Cake? Hey, I'm impressed you've been able to keep our secret this long!"
The One Where Pinkie Pie Knows,Gillian M. Berrow,pinkie pie,So you're gonna tell Twilight now?!
The One Where Pinkie Pie Knows,Gillian M. Berrow,shining armor,"[hushed] You're gonna have to wait just a little bit longer. We have something special planned. It'll be worth it, I promise."
The One Where Pinkie Pie Knows,Gillian M. Berrow,pinkie pie,It'd better be.
The One Where Pinkie Pie Knows,Gillian M. Berrow,applejack,"So, do you think Shining Armor liked his surprise?"
The One Where Pinkie Pie Knows,Gillian M. Berrow,twilight sparkle,Didn't you see him? He couldn't stop raving about it!
The One Where Pinkie Pie Knows,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,Where did Shining Armor and Cadance say they'd meet us? [stomach rumbling] I'm starving!
The One Where Pinkie Pie Knows,Gillian M. Berrow,twilight sparkle,"In the town square. I wish they'd waited to walk over with us, but they said they had something to take care of first!"
The One Where Pinkie Pie Knows,Gillian M. Berrow,pinkie pie,[through gritted teeth] They're gonna have a lot more to take care of soon...
The One Where Pinkie Pie Knows,Gillian M. Berrow,twilight sparkle,What?
The One Where Pinkie Pie Knows,Gillian M. Berrow,pinkie pie,Nothiiiiiiing!
The One Where Pinkie Pie Knows,Gillian M. Berrow,twilight sparkle,That's odd. Usually they're quite punctual.
The One Where Pinkie Pie Knows,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,Ughhh! I need a hayburger in my belly right now!
The One Where Pinkie Pie Knows,Gillian M. Berrow,rarity,What does it say?
The One Where Pinkie Pie Knows,Gillian M. Berrow,twilight sparkle,"A scavenger hunt! Shining Armor used to set these up for me when I was a filly! At the end, there was always a big prize, like a new book, or several new books, or<U+0097>"

The One Where Pinkie Pie Knows,Gillian M. Berrow,pinkie pie,"Focus, everypony!"

The One Where Pinkie Pie Knows,Gillian M. Berrow,pinkie pie,"Ooh! I do, I do! Go down that hall, then you take a left, then a right, then another right, then a slight left, and it's the third door from the right!"
The One Where Pinkie Pie Knows,Gillian M. Berrow,fluttershy,"Wow, Pinkie. I never knew you knew so much about town hall."
The One Where Pinkie Pie Knows,Gillian M. Berrow,pinkie pie,There's a lot of things I know! That you don't know I know!

The One Where Pinkie Pie Knows,Gillian M. Berrow,shining armor,What's that?
The One Where Pinkie Pie Knows,Gillian M. Berrow,twilight sparkle,"Mmmm, the book prize at the end!"
The One Where Pinkie Pie Knows,Gillian M. Berrow,shining armor,"[laughs] There's still a prize, but it's a little different this time."
The One Where Pinkie Pie Knows,Gillian M. Berrow,twilight sparkle,Oh. I don't understand.
The One Where Pinkie Pie Knows,Gillian M. Berrow,princess cadance,All the places we sent you today had something in common.
The One Where Pinkie Pie Knows,Gillian M. Berrow,twilight sparkle,First we went to the schoolhouse...
The One Where Pinkie Pie Knows,Gillian M. Berrow,twilight sparkle,And then we read the Foal Free Press... After that we found Applejack's birth certificate... And then the last clue was under a crib.
The One Where Pinkie Pie Knows,Gillian M. Berrow,twilight sparkle,Hmmm... School... foal... birth certificate... and crib... [gasps] Can it be? Are you two...?!
The One Where Pinkie Pie Knows,Gillian M. Berrow,pinkie pie,"A baby, Twilight! It's a baby! Woo-hoo!"

Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,Happy Hearth's Warming Eve!

Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,twilight sparkle,We're about to hang our Hearth's Warming dolls if you wanna join us.
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,applejack,"Oh, that's mighty sweet of you, but we're just stoppin' in to wish y'all a happy Hearth's Warmin' before we go."
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,twilight sparkle,I think it's sweet that your families are spending the holiday together.
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,Picture the most fun-tacular thing you can think of. Now multiply that times infinity! Whoo! It's gonna be great!
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,applejack,That's us. See you later!
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,spike,Now can we open presents?
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,applejack,But tonight is Hearth's Warming Eve. Everypony knows you don't open presents 'til tomorrow.
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,twilight sparkle,"When Spike and I spent our first Hearth's Warming Eve together, he couldn't wait all night to open his presents! Ever since then, we've always opened them the night before!"
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,spike,It's kinda like our tradition!
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,applejack,"That's not how our family does it, and I reckon it can't be how Pinkie's does it. Is it?"
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,No sirree!
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,twilight sparkle,"To each their own, I suppose."
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,"Agh! Gotta go, bye!"
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,spike,Just what I always wanted! A book...
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,applejack,"It's so excitin'! Related or not, it's gonna be a hoot havin' our families together under one roof!"
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,Apples and Pies together again for the first time! Maybe. Unless we're related! Which maybe we're not. I think I just confused myself.
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,applejack,"Friends or family, this here's about togetherness."
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,apple bloom,"[mouth full] Have you tried the Equestria flag crepes? The blue is blueberry! And don't tell Granny I saw, but her trunk is full of presents!"
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,applejack,"Now hang on, sugarcube. You know Hearth's Warmin' isn't just about candy and presents, right?"
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,apple bloom,Uh-oh. That's your boring sisterly lecture voice.
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,applejack,"'Fraid so! [clears throat] A long time ago, the Earth ponies, Pegasus ponies, and unicorn ponies weren't friends."
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,[as unicorn pony] I don't like you! [as Pegasus pony] I don't like you either!
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,applejack,"But then, the icy chill of the Windigos almost iced up everythin'. So the ponies decided to work together, and their friendship drove them nasty critters away."
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,"[as Pegasus pony] Beat it, Windigos!"
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,applejack,"Triumphant, they raised a new flag to celebrate all three tribes, and Equestria was born."
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,applejack,"Uh, what happened to the flag?"
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,apple bloom,Is that why we celebrate with a flag raisin' tomorrow?
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,applejack,"Mm-hmm! And tonight, we'll have the traditional Hearth's Warmin' Eve dinner to remember the shared bounties of our ancestors."
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,We do that too!
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,applejack,Then we'll hang our Hearth's Warmin' dolls over the fireplace to remind us of the warmth shared on that fateful night.
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,That's what our family does too!
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,applejack,"And tomorrow, we open presents!"
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,Ah! We do that too!
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,apple bloom,Sounds like the Apples and the Pies do everything the same way!
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,applejack,"""Rooftastic""?"
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,"As in, I'm gonna stand on the roof and yell to everypony how rooftastic this is!"
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,applejack,What if our families don't like each other?
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,maud pie,"[deadpan] I'm so excited to see you, Pinkie Pie. You too, Applejack. I hope you had fun sledding yesterday."
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,applejack,How'd you know that?
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,maud pie,[deadpan] Isn't it obvious? There are specks of extrusive andesite on your hoof. It's a mountain rock.
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,granny smith,"[hushed] Oh, she's good."
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,How's school going?
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,maud pie,"[deadpan] If you thought quartz was high on the Mohs hardness scale, wait 'til I tell you about corundum."
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,I missed you so much!
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,applejack,This place looks amazin'!
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,"Come on, everypony! Meet my super-mega-fun-derful family! Everypony, meet everypony!"
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,granny smith,"Y'all gabbin' with words real funny-like. Wh-wh-what'd you say them names were? ""Iggy""? And I'm just gonna call you ""Big Mama Q""!"
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,"Aye aye, Captain Grumpy! No one's gonna mess with your precious mine!"
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,"[sighs] Everypony stay away from Holder's Boulder. There, you happy now?"
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,applejack,And you must be<U+0097>
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,"This is Marble Pie, my baby sister who's only a few minutes younger than me but she'll always be a baby to me, isn't that right? She's so excited to meet everypony! Oh, and she wishes you all a happy Hearth's Warming!"
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,applejack,"[hushed, to Apple Bloom] Guess Pinkie Pie always did the talkin' for her."
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,[whistles] Attention!
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,I'll just be a second. Everypony get settled in! There's plenty of room upstairs. And then it's time for Hearth's Warming Eve dinner!
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,applejack,"[hushed] So far, so good, cousin!"
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,Hee-hee!
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,apple bloom,"Oh, I can't wait to taste their fresh sweet rolls! They're my favorite part of Hearth's Warmin' Eve dinner."
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,granny smith,I'm more of a six-layer bean dip filly myself!
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,apple bloom,"I love that too! Oh, Applejack, do you think theirs'll be even better than ours?"
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,applejack,"Well, that's a mighty tall order, but it wouldn't surprise me in the least."
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,Are you excited for dinner time? Because guess who is! Spoiler alert <U+0096> it's me!
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,applejack,What about hot rolls and mulled cider and double-baked pot pie?
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,granny smith,"Uh, what about six-layer bean dip?"
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,maud pie,[deadpan] We have rock soup.
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,"Potato, po-tah-to. Double-baked pot pie, rock soup! Dinner is dinner. Am I right or am I right?"
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,applejack,"Yeah, um, you know what? This is what we were expectin'! Right, everypony?"
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,"[slurping, exhales] Is everything all right, Applejack?"
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,"More rock, please!"
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,"Eat up, so we can get to our Hearth's Warming dolls!"
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,applejack,Now that's somethin' I know all about!
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,Who wants a Hearth's Warming doll?
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,applejack,Are you sayin' that rock is a Hearth's Warmin' doll?
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,"Don't be silly, silly!"
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,"Our dolls are these little pieces! Isn't that right, Marble Pie?"
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,apple bloom,Our dolls are... rocks?
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,applejack,Uh... y'all don't have traditional crocheted dolls passed down in your family?
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,"Aww, you're just a frown factory because you got a weird rock. Cheer up! I'm sure you'll do great in the flag finding mission!"
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,applejack,The what findin' what now?
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,"Limestone Pie, you're the judge! Big Mac, Marble Pie, you're team one! Apple Bloom and Maud, you're team two! Ma, Pa, you're gonna be with Granny Smith. Don't think of it as team old. Think of it as team three! And I'm with Applejack of course, since we might be cousins!"
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,applejack,"So now that we're all split up, mind tellin' us what we're doin'?"
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,As everypony knows<U+0097>
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,"Sheesh. When the three tribes united to form Equestria, the first flag was sewn by Nimble Thimble. It's tradition to raise a flag on Hearth's Warming to celebrate that famous day."
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,But who gets to put the flag on Holder's Boulder?
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,applejack,You mean on the flagpole?
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,"No, silly, it goes on the highest point! And who's the lucky pony?"
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,applejack,"Traditionally, it's the youngest<U+0097>"
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,"[quickly] On your marks, get set, go!"
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,applejack,"Pinkie Pie, will you please tell us what's goin' on?"
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,I'll explain on the way!
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,applejack,I still don't understand.
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,"Earlier today, Limestone Pie hid an obsidian stone. Whoever finds it gets to raise the flag!"
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,applejack,"It's all just so... complicated, and... rock-based."
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,"Well, how else would we do it?"
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,applejack,I don't know. I sure hope everypony else is havin' a better time.
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,big mcintosh,Eeyup.
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,big mcintosh,Eeeeeeeeeyup.
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,granny smith,"So, how'd you meet this Iggy feller?"
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,granny smith,"Hoo-wee, I gots to look into this oldfangled choosin' stone thing. You reckon it knows any apple-farmin' hunks?"
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,apple bloom,What does the rock look like?
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,maud pie,[deadpan] It looks like something that formed when volcanic lava cooled quickly.
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,apple bloom,Oh.
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,maud pie,[deadpan] Have you ever wished you could turn into a rock?
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,apple bloom,I had a dream once I was an apple.
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,maud pie,[deadpan] We have a lot in common when it comes to thinking about turning into things.
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,"Found it, found it, found it!"
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,applejack,"A picture? I've been lookin' for a real stone, Pinkie Pie!"
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,"Um, that would be weird. Do you know what this means? I get to raise the flag, and now it's time to hide the presents!"
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,applejack,Y'all hide your presents?
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,"Of course! What's more fun than getting a present? Finding a present! Although, most years, nopony finds one."
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,applejack,So nopony gets presents?
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,"Eh, not usually."
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,applejack,"So lemme get all this straight. You're only allowed to eat rock soup for dinner, then the pony who finds this rock gets to raise the flag, but not really 'cause you don't got no flagpole, and to top it off, you don't even get presents?!"
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,"Well, it doesn't sound very fun when you say it that way."
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,applejack,"Well, how 'bout you picture this? Both our families, openin' presents, raisin' the flag...?"
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,Picturing it... Loving it...!
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,"Goodnight, everypony!"
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,applejack,"Goodnight, Pinkie Pie! [hushed] We've gotta do somethin', y'all! Pinkie Pie's family never had a real Hearth's Warmin'!"
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,granny smith,Is that really what she said?
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,applejack,"Well, I-I'm sure it's what she meant."
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,apple bloom,These are their traditions.
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,big mcintosh,Eeyup.
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,applejack,"[sighs] I know they have their traditions and we have ours, but I just want them to see how much better theirs could be."
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,Hearth's Warming!
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,applejack,"It's Hearth's Warmin', Apple-style! We've been doin' everythin' your way, I thought we could mix it up a bit! Marble Pie, you could raise the Equestria flag up this pole, because you're the youngest Pie! Ma and Pa Pie, we'll cook you up a meal you'll never forget! And look, we all get presents without havin' to find 'em!"
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,"...Yeah, this is gonna be great! All the stuff she's said. Right, everypony?"
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,"Well, I wanna be one big family!"
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,"I, um, well, I-I don't know! [tearing up] Don't make me choose!"
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,applejack,"I didn't mean to cause a fuss... Why don't we just open presents around the flag pole? It'll be fun, you'll see!"
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,maud pie,Excuse me. You planted your pole on a fault line.
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,applejack,"Oh, boy."
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,You didn't have to ask them to leave!
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,"This was all a misunderstanding, everypony! I know Applejack, and she'd never do anything bad to anypony!"
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,Then it's my fault too...
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,granny smith,"Prob'ly best if we head back to Sweet Apple Acres. Maybe in time we'll be friends again, but for the now it's best if we give them a little space."
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,apple bloom,I wish we didn't have to. I really like Maud. She's sweet once you get to know her. They all are. Worst Hearth's Warmin' ever.
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,granny smith,"Eh, has anypony seen Applejack?"
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,applejack,[sniffling] I really cracked the corn this time.
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,[sniffling] I really popped the pi<f1>ata this time.
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,applejack,Pinkie Pie?
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,[yelps] What are you doing here?
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,applejack,What are you doin' here?
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,applejack,"I'm too ashamed to go back up there. Your family, my family, they all must think I'm such a nincompoop."
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,"Aw, no one thinks that! Pushy, aggressive, mean... Oh, I'm not helping. Sorry."
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,applejack,I'm sorry I forced my traditions over yours. I don't want you to have to choose between the family you were born into and the friends who love you like one. I really hoped we could be one big happy family. I guess not.
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,Don't say that!
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,applejack,"I wish I could stay, but I have a train to catch."
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,[crying] H-Ha... Happy Hearth's Warming.
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,applejack,[tearing up] You too.
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,granny smith,"You want to know why Holder's Boulder's so danged important? [exhales] Well, now their great-great-great-great-great-great-grandfather Holder Cobblestone <U+0096> he found that boulder in a dragon's nest, older than time itself! He built the family farm around it, even though it was just an ordinary rock. It always brought them good luck."
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,applejack,"Aw, crickets! That is important! I got so caught up in the things they were doin', I never asked why they did 'em!"
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,applejack,"[reading] To Applejack, from Pinkie Pie. Cousins forever."
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,apple bloom,You just found your first Pie Hearth's Warmin' present ever!
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,applejack,[laughing] Only Pinkie Pie could hide a present on a movin' train. ...What a great tradition. [beat] Stop the train!
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,"[straining] Come on... you... boulder, come on... agh!"
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,maud pie,[deadpan] I'm pushing as hard as I can too.
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,applejack,Need a little help?
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,[gasps] Apples!
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,applejack,"I wasn't tryin' to take your traditions away, I was tryin' to share ours. I was so focused on us bein' one big happy family, I thought we needed the same traditions right away. What I should've done was learn about yours and teach you about ours. And over time, we'd make new traditions together. I'm sorry, y'all."
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,I think we've just invented our first combined tradition! Pushing Holder's Boulder out of the quarry! [squeals] I can't wait for Applejack to knock it over next Hearth's Warming!
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,"Marble Pie, you want to wish Big Mac a happy Hearth's Warming, don't you! And you too, right, Big Mac?"
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,big mcintosh,[short giggle] Eeyup.
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,granny smith,"Eh, lemme see here, uh... 'If thou ask-eth me, uh, thou two art, eh, okay-eth in my book'."
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,Happy Hearth's Warming!
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,applejack,"Happy Hearth's Warmin', Pinkie Pie."
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,apple bloom,"Attention, everypony! Maud wants to sing some Hearth's Warmin' carols that she wrote!"
Hearthbreakers,Nick Confalone,maud pie,"[deadpan] The first one is about rocks. They're all about rocks. [reading, deadpan] Hearth's Warming is great. Like calcium silicate. What a wonderful day. As good as mica or clay."
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,fluttershy,"Fuzzy Legs, do you think you could secure those windows?"
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,fluttershy,And you'll alert me if anything scary comes close to the cottage?
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,fluttershy,"Oh, who am I kidding? When something scary comes close to the cottage! Please tell me my hiding place is ready."
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,fluttershy,"Oh, look, you've filled it with everything I need to survive this awful night. Thank you. Thank you all! Now I don't have to step a hoof outside until this whole thing is over."
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,fluttershy,"Oh, no! You don't have any carrots? Do we have any other fresh veggies you may enjoy?"
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,fluttershy,Or maybe some hay? But that means I'll need to go out... on Nightmare Night!
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,granny smith,"Fluttershy? What're you doin' out and about? It's Nightmare Night, remember?"
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,fluttershy,"How could I forget? Oh, I don't suppose I could borrow a few pieces of hay from you? I forgot to stock up on food for Angel, and you do seem to have quite a lot."
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,granny smith,We need it for the Apple Family Haunted Maze. [spooky voice] The scariest maze that there ever was. Who knows what lurks inside?
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,fluttershy,"Oh, I'm sure I don't."
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,granny smith,Is that a mummified pony that just leaped out at ya?
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,fluttershy,I don't know. Is it?
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,granny smith,And what's that crunchin' sound beneath yer hooves? Maybe it's the bones of ponies that didn't make it out alive!
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,fluttershy,B-B-B-B-Bones?!
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,granny smith,And are those peeled grapes or a thousand slimy eyeballs starin' at ya from beyond the grave?
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,fluttershy,Please tell me they're grapes!
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,granny smith,Huh. I wonder what got stuck in her craw.
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,spike,"You think it's scary now, just wait until it's done."
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,fluttershy,That's okay. I'll take your word for it.
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,spike,"[grunts] Hey, wait a minute! It's Nightmare Night and you're here and not holed up in your cottage! Does this mean what I think it means?"
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,fluttershy,That I foolishly forgot to stock up on food for Angel and had to go out to get him something but got spooked in town so I came here hoping Twilight had some lettuce I could give him?
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,spike,Oh. I thought maybe you decided to come out with us tonight.
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,fluttershy,"Goodness, no! I couldn't be out tonight. I just couldn't."
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,spike,"Technically speaking, you already are out right now."
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,fluttershy,Oh. I guess that is true.
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,spike,So what if you stayed out a little longer with your friends? I know they'd be super excited.
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,fluttershy,You think so?
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,spike,"You would make them so happy if you joined in. They wouldn't believe their eyes! Come on, Fluttershy, what do you say?"
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,pinkie pie,"And then it got very, very quiet and suddenly they realized the balloons had never been inflated!"
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,rarity,Did I ever tell you about the night that the mannequin came to life and haunted all the costumes?
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,rainbow dash,What happened?
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,rarity,"I just told you, darling. A mannequin came to life and haunted all the costumes."
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,fluttershy,"Hi, everypony."
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,twilight sparkle,"Fluttershy, what are you doing here? Is everything okay?"
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,fluttershy,"Everything is fine. In fact, it's more than fine. I've decided to join you in your Nightmare Night festivities."
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,rainbow dash,[scoffs] Seriously? You? Out? Tonight?
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,fluttershy,"Every Nightmare Night, I shut myself in my cottage and refuse to come out until morning. But it's just like when I was afraid to sing in front of anypony. If I hadn't given it a try, I never would've found out how much I enjoy it."
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,applejack,And we'd have missed out on how great you sound.
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,rarity,"Fluttershy with us on Nightmare Night? Why, that's positively the most wonderful news I've heard in ages!"
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,pinkie pie,You can get dressed up in a costume with us and play Nightmare Night games with us and eat candy apples with us!
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,applejack,Don't forget the best part. Goin' through my family's corn maze!
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,fluttershy,"Oh, right. The maze."
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,applejack,"Uh, only if you're up for it."
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,fluttershy,"Oh, I am! I am ready to take on Nightmare Night!"
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,rarity,"Mummy? No. Headless pony? No. Vampire fruit bat? Ugh, definitely no. You see, Fluttershy, the beauty of Nightmare Night is that you don't have to dress up as something scary."
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,rarity,Ooh! Yes. This one will look gorgeous on you. Period costumes are all the rage this year. What? No good?
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,fluttershy,"What if we encounter something terrifying and need to get away quickly? All those layers could slow me down, or worse, make me trip!"
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,rarity,Oh. I never... considered that. Never fear!
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,rarity,"[hums] Ooh, now this is a real stunner! I call it ""Masquerade""! Just a simple black dress underneath but with this ornately decorated mask!"
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,fluttershy,A mask?
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,rarity,No?
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,fluttershy,They can just be so difficult to see out of.
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,rarity,"Yes, but this one has eyeholes."
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,fluttershy,W-What about being able to see what's to the left or right of me?
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,rarity,"I suppose your vision would be somewhat obscured. It's your first Nightmare Night out and about, and we do want you to be comfortable."
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,fluttershy,What if I just wear the dress?
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,rarity,"Oh, sure, dear. That's... fine. [to herself] It's so plain, it's frightening. [out loud] Oh, my! Look at all of you! My costumes fit you to a T!"
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,applejack,"Hoo-wee, we're gonna have the best time!"
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,rainbow dash,"Hey, Fluttershy, where's your costume?"
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,fluttershy,I'm wearing it.
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,pinkie pie,[gasps] I get it! You're a robber escaping into the night! You're a ninja escaping into the night! You're black licorice escaping into the night!
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,fluttershy,Close. I'm going to a masquerade ball. Without the mask.
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,twilight sparkle,"Oh, that's great! Isn't it great?"
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,rainbow dash,"Oh, yeah."
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,pinkie pie,So creative.
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,applejack,Great costume.
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,pinkie pie,I figured I'd save the really scary games for next year when Fluttershy's more used to it.
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,pinkie pie,Okay... go!
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,rainbow dash,"[grunting] Good luck beating that, Fluttershy!"
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,fluttershy,"Well, um, it's just that if I'm blindfolded and somepony were to leap out in front of me, I'd never have the chance to defend myself."
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,rarity,"That's fine, darling. You don't have to do anything you don't want to."
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,twilight sparkle,We're just glad you're here.
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,pinkie pie,We don't have to finish that game. I have another one I know you'll love! Bobbing for apples!
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,twilight sparkle,"Fluttershy, what's wrong?"
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,fluttershy,"It's just that, um... What happens if, when my head is deep down in the water, some kind of scary monster appears? How would I even hear to know I was under attack?"
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,pinkie pie,Time for candy!
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,fluttershy,It is?
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,pinkie pie,"I made candy bags. Each bag has been made with each of you in mind, complete with each of your favorite candies!"
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,rainbow dash,Ha! Awesome!
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,pinkie pie,Here. Take it. Take it! What are you waiting for?
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,fluttershy,"Well, it's just... What if when I'm eating one of these chewy taffies, my mouth becomes glued shut and I can't scream for help?"
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,fluttershy,"Oh, goodness. We've only just started to celebrate Nightmare Night together, and I'm already taking all the fun out of it, aren't I?"
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,pinkie pie,You're not taking out all of the fun.
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,rainbow dash,"Just, like, ninety per<U+0097>"
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,rainbow dash,...Some of it.
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,fluttershy,I really wanna do this. But there's just so many things that terrify me about tonight. I couldn't possibly predict what might upset me.
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,twilight sparkle,Unless... you were the one doing the scaring!
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,rainbow dash,Her scaring us? [laughing] Oh. You're being serious.
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,twilight sparkle,"The thing you hate is being scared, but if you're the one doing the scaring, then..."
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,fluttershy,Then I can help you all have fun and I can still be a part of Nightmare Night!
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,twilight sparkle,So you like that idea?
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,fluttershy,"I think I do! And I don't want to get ahead of myself, but I think I have the perfect idea for how I'm gonna do it!"
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,pinkie pie,"Really? Oh, this is so exciting!"
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,fluttershy,"[spooky voice] Meet me at my cottage in an hour. [normal voice] Oh, I'm excited to see everypony soon!"
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,fluttershy,[spooky voice] Welcome to Fluttershy's tea party!
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,rainbow dash,"Did she just say ""tea party""?"
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,twilight sparkle,It sounds like it's a scary tea party?
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,fluttershy,"[spooky voice] Have a seat. Don't be scared of what awaits you. Go on. Pass the sugar. Oh, no! There is none! You're a terrible host! Rarity, put your coat on!"
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,rarity,Why would I do that?
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,fluttershy,"[spooky voice] You need to cover up because no one has complimented your dressssssss! Pinkie Pie, look to your left and ask your best friend to pass the cucumber sandwiches!"
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,pinkie pie,Huh? I can't. There's nopony there.
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,fluttershy,[spooky voice] That's right. Because she didn't care to show uuuuuup.
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,pinkie pie,What?
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,fluttershy,"[spooky voice] A friend who didn't come through. That must scare you to the coooore. Quick, everypony, look behind you!"
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,rainbow dash,"Uh, what are those?"
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,fluttershy,"[spooky voice] They're unplanned guests. Your woooorst nightmare. You don't have enough food for them! Oh, no! There's a tiny kitten that needs a home! But you are over-scheduled right now. You don't have time to help! I said, ""You don't have time to help!"" This should appear to scare you! [normal voice] Why don't you look terrified? You showed up to a party and everypony was extremely disappointed in you. Can you imagine anything more upsetting?"
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,rarity,"It was a really good try, darling, but the scares at Nightmare Night are of an entirely different nature."
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,twilight sparkle,"It was really creative, though. I never would have thought of... all this."
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,fluttershy,"Oh, I'm just not cut out for this. Just go on without me."
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,rarity,"Oh, no. We couldn't possibly."
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,fluttershy,You have to. This is the night you look forward to all year.
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,pinkie pie,We could... stay here?
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,fluttershy,It's okay. I really want you all to have fun. This is how I spend every Nightmare Night. Please go. I'll be fine.
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,pinkie pie,"Eh, it's funny. I actually thought she had an idea for something really scary for a second there."
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,applejack,She definitely tried her hardest.
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,fluttershy,I did try my hardest.
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,fluttershy,Or... maybe not. I suppose I could have gone with something a bit scarier. You're right! I've been taking baby steps! I think it's time for grown up ones! I don't suppose you have any ideas how I could do that?
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,applejack,"Everypony's linin' up for the corn maze, y'all! Let's go!"
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,spike,"Oh, yeah! I can't believe we're finally doin' this!"
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,rainbow dash,It's a good thing Fluttershy isn't here because she would never be able to handle this!
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,big mcintosh,Boooo... Eeyup.
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,rarity,What. Is. That. Sound?
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,pinkie pie,It looks like... bones!
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,rainbow dash,Looks like a bunch of dried sticks painted white to me.
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,applejack,"Hey, try to keep up the illusion, would ya?"
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,pinkie pie,Whoo!
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,applejack,Agh! What was that?
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,spike,Don't you know?
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,applejack,"Uh, o-of course I do. It was, uh..."
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,rarity,[grunts] Fluttershy had a point with the layers on the dress.
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,rarity,What is this? Is it a tunnel? Where does it lead?!
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,twilight sparkle,Which way are we supposed to go now?!
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,applejack,"Uh, I don't know! I don't know what's goin' on!"
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,rainbow dash,[grunts] What do you mean? Didn't you help plan this?
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,spike,"Applejack, didn't you know about any of this?!"
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,applejack,"Alright, I got to admit I didn't know about any of this, but maybe they're just tryin' to make it interestin' for me, too! I'm sure Granny Smith or Big Mac is behind this."
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,big mcintosh,Eeyup.
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,applejack,[teeth chatter] That's what we were supposed to do! I don't know why we're down here! This is really scarin' me now!
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,pinkie pie,How did that get down here?!
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,rainbow dash,RUUUUUUUUUN!
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,pinkie pie,I can't see!
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,rainbow dash,I can barely move!
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,rainbow dash,It's like glue!
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,fluttershy,"Oh, my! I'm so, so sorry. Can you ever forgive me?"
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,applejack,Fluttershy?
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,rainbow dash,It was you the whole time?!
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,twilight sparkle,I can't believe it!
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,rarity,That... was...
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,rainbow dash,It was way more terrifying than the most terrifying thing I could have thought of!
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,applejack,You out-nightmared the scariest part of the corn maze!
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,twilight sparkle,How did you do all this?!
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,fluttershy,"After you left, I realized that I wasn't ready to give up on Nightmare Night. So I asked Granny Smith if I could try to make the maze even scarier for my friends."
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,rainbow dash,You came up with all of this?
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,fluttershy,"I had some help. Angel was the scary figure that kept scurrying after you in the maze. Fuzzy Legs made the sticky wall that made it difficult for you to see and move. And, of course, Harry was the especially scary monster."
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,twilight sparkle,Wow! That was inspired!
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,pinkie pie,You have to do this every year!
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,applejack,Uh-huh!
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,rarity,Absolutely!
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,twilight sparkle,Every year!
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,rainbow dash,Yeah!
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,fluttershy,We could celebrate Nightmare Night together every year. But the truth is I really don't want to.
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,pinkie pie,You don't?!
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,rarity,But you've done it. You found a way that we can all have a fabulous time together.
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,fluttershy,"Yes, but I've also realized something. You all may love Nightmare Night and I may be good at being a part of it, but it's no fun for me to see my friends feel like they're in danger, even if I know they're not. I really don't like it. It's just not my cup of tea."
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,pinkie pie,Spoooooooooky tea?
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,fluttershy,"No. Just regular tea. We do lots of fun things together, but I'm afraid this just isn't gonna be one of them. Actually, I'm not afraid. I'm perfectly fine with it."
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,twilight sparkle,"Then we are, too."
Scare Master,Natasha Levinger,fluttershy,[sighs] I don't know why I doubted myself for a second. Now this is what I call a perfect Nightmare Night.
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,spike,[sighs] Didn't we just shelve all the books in the library a few months ago?
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,twilight sparkle,"Yes, but that was because we needed to! This is just because I want to! I call it my ""book-sort-cation""! Three uninterrupted days of reorganizing books. Can you think of anything more relaxing?"
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,spike,"Well, claw massages, back rubs, bubble baths... You weren't really looking for an answer, were you?"
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,twilight sparkle,I've even devised a better system for organizing them. It decreases the amount of time it takes to find a book you're looking for by nearly three quarters of a second!
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,spike,[flatly] Whoa. That much?
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,twilight sparkle,"Look at them all. Why, there must be at least twenty thousand books to organize!"
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,twilight sparkle,Best long weekend ever! I'm sure we can make some time for a claw massage and a back rub too.
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,spike,Yes! Best long weekend ever!
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,spike,Whoa! That strange yellow orb in the sky! What is that?
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,twilight sparkle,"Alright, alright, so it's been a little while since we've seen the sun."
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,spike,A little while? We've been in that library for three straight days!
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,twilight sparkle,"Yes, but they were three very productive days! Even if you did take that two-hour claw massage break."
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,spike,"Hey, you promise a claw massage, I'm getting a claw massage."
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,twilight sparkle,It's not like we missed anything.
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,twilight sparkle,"Hi, Rainbow Dash. Good to see you, Discord."
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,spike,Did you rehearse before you found us?
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,twilight sparkle,"Come on, Rainbow Dash. What's going on here?"
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,rainbow dash,[laughing] Sorry. Me and Discord are just messin' around. Like we do.
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,twilight sparkle,Since when?
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,rainbow dash,[laughing] Sneaky snake!
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,discord,[laughing] Just snaking around!
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,twilight sparkle,It is?
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,rainbow dash,Kind of an inside joke from this weekend. You wouldn't really get it unless you were there.
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,twilight sparkle,Oh. Okay.
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,rainbow dash,"Cool. Well, uh, catch you later, Twilight!"
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,discord,"[laughing] Catch you later, Twilight."
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,twilight sparkle,"That was strange, right? Since when have Rainbow Dash and Discord had inside jokes?"
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,spike,"Since sometime in the last three days, I guess."
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,twilight sparkle,Hey! Nopony made you join me on my book-sort-cation.
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,spike,"I'm jokin', I'm jokin'!"
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,twilight sparkle,Rarity?
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,rarity,[gasps] Twilight! You've returned from your book sorting sabbatical! All that organizing has done wonders for your complexion!
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,twilight sparkle,Thanks! It was very relaxing. And we were able to clear a shelf for those old-fashioned books you wanted to donate.
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,rarity,"Oh, pfft, they're not old, darling. They're vintage, and they're over there! I've even included my favorites by former Canterlot designer to the stars Rococo Froufrou!"
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,spike,"Oh, I love her!"
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,rarity,Him.
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,spike,[laughs nervously] Both.
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,discord,Twilight! This makes twice I'm seeing you in one day! Aren't I lucky?
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,twilight sparkle,Weren't you just with<U+0097>
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,fluttershy,"Hi, Twilight! Hi, Spike! How was your book-sort-cation?"
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,twilight sparkle,It was good!
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,fluttershy,[giggles] Orange you glad you did it?
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,fluttershy,"Oh, please. You'll make me blush."
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,discord,You do seem to be turning a shade of... [gasps] orange!
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,rarity,"Oh, sorry, darling. You see, we were at Sweet Apple Acres and, uh, ooh, how to explain..."
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,discord,"Well, let me try and paint her a picture, dearest."
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,spike,"[to himself] ""Dearest""?"
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,discord,"[imitating Bob Ross] You see, we were all at Sweet Apple Acres, and I ended up turning the trees into the most<U+0097> [normal] Oh, who am I kidding? I simply can't do it justice. You really had to be there."
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,fluttershy,"We would've invited you to come along too, but we didn't want to interrupt your organizing. We know how important it is to you."
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,twilight sparkle,"I appreciate that... Speaking of books, I should get these on the shelves."
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,twilight sparkle,"Hmm. Rainbow Dash bonding with Discord, Rarity finding something he did genuinely funny... Must've been some weekend."
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,spike,Somepony sorry she missed it?
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,twilight sparkle,Of course not.
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,twilight sparkle,What's got you two in hysterics?
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,discord,"[gulps] Oh, we were just reminiscing about the best weekend ever!"
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,twilight sparkle,"[hushed] He's everywhere today, isn't he?"
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,discord,"Oh, now where was I? Ah, yes, we had just finished our soup, and then Applejack said, [imitating Applejack] ""Peanut butter hoof? Yuck, not even with jelly!"""
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,twilight sparkle,"Eh, I don't get it."
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,pinkie pie,[laughing] It was hilarious! I wish we'd taken a picture for you!
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,discord,"Oh, well, this should do!"
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,twilight sparkle,I guess that's funny?
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,pinkie pie,[within laughter] Sticky situation!
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,applejack,"Aw, shucks, Twilight. We haven't even asked how your weekend went."
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,twilight sparkle,It was fine!
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,twilight sparkle,I am not glum. I'm glad! I'm glad you all had such a good time together. Having inside jokes can really create a lasting bond between friends.
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,discord,I'm just sorry that all this bonding happened while you were holed up in your castle.
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,applejack,"Heh. Oh, don't you worry about Twilight. Bet you were in hog heaven organizin' all them books. Again."
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,twilight sparkle,I'm sure I had just as much fun as the rest of you.
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,twilight sparkle,I can't believe I missed out on all that bonding!
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,spike,[gulps] I knew it! You are jealous!
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,twilight sparkle,"Spike, I'm the Princess of Friendship. I don't get jealous. I'm sorry I missed out because sharing that experience would've helped me with my Princess of Friendship duties!"
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,spike,[chewing] [mouth full] Come again?
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,twilight sparkle,"If our friends could enjoy three full days with Discord that much, it must have something to do with the specific things they did together! If we could find out what those things were, it could be a real breakthrough in the science of friendship!"
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,spike,Hm. I guess so.
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,twilight sparkle,I know so! You thought our book-sort-cation was fun? This is gonna be even better!
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,twilight sparkle,Thank you for coming. I wouldn't have asked you here if it wasn't important.
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,pinkie pie,I love important!
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,twilight sparkle,I want to know how these funny moments you shared came to pass. I can use this data to help advance friendships all over Equestria.
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,applejack,"Well, I like the sound of that!"
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,twilight sparkle,Perfect. Let's start with the snake.
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,rainbow dash,I don't know if I can get it out! It's too funny!
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,discord,"Oh, but we must! It's for the greater good! It started when we were helping Granny Smith with her garden..."
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,applejack,"Uh, I reckon you mean my sister Apple Bloom."
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,discord,Eh... All you Apples look the same. And then Rainbow Dash saw a snake!
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,fluttershy,I think it was a garden hose.
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,rainbow dash,It was a hose snake. Super deadly.
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,applejack,"I recall it bein' a large stick that looked like a hose that, in turn, did in fact resemble a snake."
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,pinkie pie,"Point is, we galloped away."
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,rainbow dash,And it chased after us!
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,twilight sparkle,The hose? A snake? A stick?
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,rainbow dash,A snake!
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,fluttershy,A hose!
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,applejack,A stick!
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,discord,We literally trotted for our lives. Isn't that hilarious?
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,fluttershy,I guess you had to be there.
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,twilight sparkle,I do need to be there.
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,rarity,"But you weren't! And it's already happened! Ooh, are you suggesting..."
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,pinkie pie,Time travel?!
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,twilight sparkle,Absolutely not! Time travel is not something to be messed with. We simply need to recreate everything that led to these jokes.
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,discord,"Oh, what a brilliant idea! Shall we begin with the lunch date that kicked off the glorious weekend you missed out on?"
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,twilight sparkle,Are you sure it was this table?
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,rainbow dash,"Uh, does it really matter?"
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,twilight sparkle,"When it comes to science, everything matters. One change to the equation could ruin the experiment."
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,discord,Ohhhhhh... it was this table here.
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,twilight sparkle,"Alright, so you sat down at the table, and then what happened?"
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,rarity,"Oh, well, first I expressed my displeasure with the design of the menu. It<U+0097>"
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,discord,"I'm sorry to interrupt, but I just noticed something."
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,twilight sparkle,Yes?
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,discord,The tablecloth. It isn't the same color as the one the restaurant used on the day in question.
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,twilight sparkle,...Really?
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,rarity,He's right! The tablecloth was red! I remember because it clashed with the font on the menus.
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,applejack,"I don't suppose that means we're gonna need to get a new tablecloth, does it?"
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,discord,"Oh, most definitely."
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,fluttershy,Ooh.
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,pinkie pie,Wowee!
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,discord,One change to the equation could ruin the experiment. Twilight said so herself. Anything stand out as being different? Anything at all?
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,fluttershy,"Um, I've noticed a couple of things."
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,pinkie pie,Me too!
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,discord,Excellent!
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,discord,"A little to the left! No, my left! A little bit more... Oh, no, no, no, no, no, a little more right!"
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,pinkie pie,The cloud over our table looked like an ice cream sundae!
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,pinkie pie,Perfect!
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,discord,"No-no-no-no-no, this is barely room temperature! Gar<e7>on! Gar<e7>on, over here!"
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,discord,No? Nothing?
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,twilight sparkle,Are you sure there's not something you've missed? Some other detail about your lunch together that you're forgetting?
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,discord,"Well, I don't know about the rest of you, but I feel we've been pretty exhaustive in our attempts to recreate every single detail of our previous encounter."
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,rainbow dash,"Yeah, Twilight. If you don't get it by now, I don't think you're ever gonna get it."
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,twilight sparkle,But it is really important that I figure this out. It's for the good of all Equestria!
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,discord,"Well, perhaps we should have another look at the data we've collected. [gasps] Of course! There is one last variable that we haven't accounted for."
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,twilight sparkle,What?
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,discord,You!
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,twilight sparkle,Me?
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,discord,"You weren't there observing us. No matter how hard we try, we can't possibly recreate our weekend of fun exactly as it happened because you'll always be watching, and you weren't there."
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,pinkie pie,He makes a good point.
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,discord,It has only served to prove that moments of levity and bonding between friends simply cannot be recreated so that others might share in the experience.
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,pinkie pie,He makes another good point!
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,rarity,"Oh, don't worry, darling. I'm sure there'll be plenty of other chances for you to share in the kind of [starts giggling] frivolity we had with Discord while you were away."
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,fluttershy,[laughing] Absolutely.
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,twilight sparkle,"I'm not buying it. Not for a second. There is definitely something else going on here, Spike!"
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,spike,"[gulps] Or maybe there isn't, and you should just drop this whole thing and admit that you're a little jealous!"
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,twilight sparkle,"Even if I'm not able to laugh at what happened, I should be able to figure out why they find it funny. Why they think they had this amazing and hilarious time together. But I can't figure it out! It doesn't make sense!"
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,spike,Some things just can't be explained.
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,twilight sparkle,"Our friends think something great happened to them while I was away, but no. It was something awful! If we don't break the spell they're under, who knows what terrible things could happen?!"
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,spike,Spell?
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,twilight sparkle,"Come on, Spike! There's no time to lose!"
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,twilight sparkle,"Zecora, what do you think? Can you undo Discord's magic?"
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,zecora,In what way can you tell that they are indeed under a spell?
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,twilight sparkle,"They're having fun with Discord, that's why!"
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,zecora,Ah. A friendship with Discord is truly a shock. But who says it is something that we must block?
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,twilight sparkle,"Trust me, they would never laugh like that unless something magical was involved. It's not that funny. I know funny."
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,zecora,"Alright. This potion will break the spell, then you will be able to tell."
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,spike,"Wait. If that's the potion, then what's brewing in your cauldron?"
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,zecora,"It ties the room together and emits a warm glow. But if I am to be honest, it's just for show."
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,applejack,[yawns] I wonder why she asked us here so bright and early.
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,rarity,"Another map adventure, perhaps?"
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,pinkie pie,"Nope, no glowing tushies here!"
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,fluttershy,Or maybe it's more of a non-adventure. Maybe she just wants to tell us how last night's slumber went?
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,twilight sparkle,"Hey, gang!"
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,pinkie pie,"Ooh, you look excited!"
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,twilight sparkle,I am excited! We're gonna have fun today!
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,pinkie pie,Yes!
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,twilight sparkle,"Just one tiny, minuscule, microscopic thing before fun times. I need everypony to sip this potion to break Discord's spell on you!"
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,applejack,A what now?
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,twilight sparkle,"Don't be embarrassed. So what if Discord cast a spell on you so you thought you had a great time, and now you have all these inside jokes that you seem to be constantly laughing at? Don't worry! You didn't have your defenses up. I get it."
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,rainbow dash,You're kidding.
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,rarity,"Twilight, darling, we simply had a nice time with Discord. As I recall, we spent much of yesterday afternoon reenacting it for you."
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,twilight sparkle,Uh-huh. Or you reenacted what you thought was fun but really wasn't because you were under a spell that made you think what happened was fun!
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,applejack,"What kind of fertilizer have you had your nose in, Twilight?"
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,twilight sparkle,"Be honest. The only reason you won't drink the potion is because, deep down in your hearts, you know there's a chance that Discord has you under his power!"
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,fluttershy,"Twilight, how could you say such a thing?! I know Discord still makes mistakes sometimes, but you're accusing him of being downright evil!"
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,rainbow dash,"Yeah! And to top it off, you're accusing us of not being able to tell he was up to something! What do you take us for?"
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,pinkie pie,Yeah! [glug] What do you [glug] take us for?!
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,pinkie pie,"Dee-licious! Got any more, Twilight?"
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,discord,"Hi, Twilight! The gang mentioned we'd all be hanging out together today!"
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,twilight sparkle,"""The gang""?"
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,pinkie pie,[laughing] It's still funny!
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,applejack,"[hushed] So much for that whole ""spell"" theory."
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,twilight sparkle,Ugh. But it's still not funny!
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,rainbow dash,It's funny if you were there.
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,twilight sparkle,"But I wasn't there! I wasn't included! Maybe it's my own fault for staying in and having a book-sort-cation when I could have been making jokes and memories and having a great time with my friends! But I didn't do that, did I?! You all did! You were all there, but<U+0097>! [sighs] I wasn't there. I missed out. And seeing you having all these jokes I wasn't a part of and couldn't understand made me..."
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,spike,Jealous?
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,twilight sparkle,No. The Princess of Friendship can't get jealous.
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,applejack,"Sure you can, Twilight, and none of us begrudge you for it."
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,fluttershy,We're sorry if we made you feel left out.
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,twilight sparkle,You didn't do anything wrong. You're allowed to share things that don't include me.
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,rarity,And you're allowed to feel a little jealous about it. You just have to be able to admit that that's what you're feeling so you can let it go.
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,rainbow dash,"And, you know, not try to make us recreate everything that happened when you weren't around."
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,discord,Of course none of this would've happened if I hadn't encouraged everypony not to invite you this weekend.
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,twilight sparkle,They wanted me to be there? And you convinced them to not invite me?
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,discord,"Well, I didn't think that they should interrupt you. But now I see that we should have. Oh, I feel just terrible."
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,pinkie pie,You don't look like you feel terrible.
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,discord,Better?
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,applejack,"Wait a minute. You didn't suggest not inviting Twilight because you wanted to make her feel left out, did you?"
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,discord,Of course not. That whole jealousy thing was just a happy accident.
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,discord,"Certainly we can all agree that Princess Twilight learned a valuable lesson here <U+0096> that even she can have feelings of jealousy, that she should recognize said feelings rather than trying to pretend that she doesn't have them. Mm-hmm. Did I get the tiniest bit of glee out of watching her try to recreate our weekend of fun in the name of science? Oh, most definitely! But what's important here is that it was never my intent to make Twilight feel jealous. That's something that the old me would have tried to do. Orange you glad I've changed?"
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,discord,"I said, Orange you glad I've changed?"
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,discord,"Orange! Like the ones at the Applejack farm! I-I mean, from this weekend!"
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,discord,No? Nothing? Really? I thought you'd find this hisss-terical!
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,rarity,"...Yes, no. Discord, I think these jokes have run their course."
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,pinkie pie,Only way we'd find them funny now is if you put us all under some kind of spell!
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,twilight sparkle,"Come on, you'd have to be a complete crazy pony to think he'd do something like that! What are you gonna say next, Pinkie? That we all have to drink some weird potion to break the spell?"
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,discord,W-W-What's so funny?
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,rainbow dash,"Come on, Discord, do we really have to spell it out for you?"
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,discord,I-I-I don't get it. Somepony want to tell me what's so hilarious? Anypony? Hello?!
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,discord,"I'm talking to you! You! And-and you and you! W-W-What's funny about spells? I mean, really, I don't get it, I feel left out and I feel really bad about that..."
What About Discord?,Neal Dusedau,spike,"Sorry, buddy. Guess you had to be there."
The Hooffields and McColts,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,fluttershy,"Does everyanimal have their copy of Wuthering Hooves? Hooray! I love Furry Friends Book Club! Now, let's discuss the theme of nature as it applies to Hoofcliff's love."
The Hooffields and McColts,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,fluttershy,"Did somepony leave a light on? Oh, it's me. Oh! It's me!"
The Hooffields and McColts,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,fluttershy,We'll continue this discussion when I get back!
The Hooffields and McColts,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,You're here!
The Hooffields and McColts,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,Isn't this exciting?!
The Hooffields and McColts,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,fluttershy,"Oh! You were called, too! Thank goodness. I feel so much better going with a friend."
The Hooffields and McColts,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,"I was about to come and get you, but then I got distracted."
The Hooffields and McColts,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,fluttershy,Oh.
The Hooffields and McColts,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,"Ever since the map called us, I've been doing a ton of research."
The Hooffields and McColts,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,Testing out potential friendship problems.
The Hooffields and McColts,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,Diversifying my solution portfolio.
The Hooffields and McColts,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,fluttershy,Ever since the map called us? But that happened five minutes ago.
The Hooffields and McColts,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,"I know! But I wanna be one hundred percent prepared! I mean, I'm the Princess of Friendship. How would it look if I couldn't solve a friendship problem?"
The Hooffields and McColts,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,fluttershy,"Oh, I'm so lucky I'm being sent with you. Speaking of which, where are we going?"
The Hooffields and McColts,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,The Smokey Mountains!
The Hooffields and McColts,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,fluttershy,"Oh, I've never been there before."
The Hooffields and McColts,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,Neither have I. And there isn't a lot of information on them. All I could find was this. The Smokey Mountains harbor the most beautiful valley in all of Equestria between its two majestic mountain peaks.
The Hooffields and McColts,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,fluttershy,"That's gorgeous. And where there's nature, there's a ton of animal friends!"
The Hooffields and McColts,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,I can't wait to get started! I'm a little nervous since that's all I could find. I usually like to be a bit more prepared.
The Hooffields and McColts,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,fluttershy,You seem pretty prepared to me. Are those for us?
The Hooffields and McColts,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,"Yep! I've prepared our things. Snacks, books, blankets, books."
The Hooffields and McColts,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,fluttershy,"You said ""books"" twice."
The Hooffields and McColts,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,There are a lot of books.
The Hooffields and McColts,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,fluttershy,Ooh!
The Hooffields and McColts,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,What do ya think our friendship problem's gonna be?
The Hooffields and McColts,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,Do you think it'll be a problem about lying?
The Hooffields and McColts,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,fluttershy,[grunts] I'm sure we'll find out when we get there.
The Hooffields and McColts,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,You're right.
The Hooffields and McColts,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,"Ooh! Could it be about when two friends just randomly decide to do something together, but they forget to invite the third friend, and the third friend feels left out?"
The Hooffields and McColts,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,Or where one friend tells another friend's secret after they asked them not to?
The Hooffields and McColts,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,fluttershy,"[exhausted] We'll know very, very soon. Since we're almost there."
The Hooffields and McColts,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,Here. Lemme get that.
The Hooffields and McColts,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,fluttershy,[sighs] Thank you.
The Hooffields and McColts,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,Sorry I've been a little skiddly-bopty-boo. I just can't believe this is finally happening!
The Hooffields and McColts,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,fluttershy,Whoa!
The Hooffields and McColts,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,Whoa! What in Equestria is happening?
The Hooffields and McColts,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,fluttershy,It's nothing like your book said it would be!
The Hooffields and McColts,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,"Oh, boy. I'm feeling very unprepared. Where do we even start?"
The Hooffields and McColts,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,fluttershy,Maybe by figuring out where the flying pumpkins are coming from?
The Hooffields and McColts,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,"Um, hi. Hello. Excuse us, but what are you doing?"
The Hooffields and McColts,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,fluttershy,"Yes, but, um, why are you... ""pumpkining"" your neighbors?"
The Hooffields and McColts,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,"I am Twilight Sparkle, the Princess of Friendship. And I am here to solve your friendship problem."
The Hooffields and McColts,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,fluttershy,"I'm Fluttershy, and... um... I'm here, too."
The Hooffields and McColts,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,"Well, maybe there could be if we figure out what the McColts did to make you so mad."
The Hooffields and McColts,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,fluttershy,"Oh, no!"
The Hooffields and McColts,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,"I know what to do. We're gonna talk with these McColts and hear their side of the story. Once we have all the facts, we can put an end to this using reason and rationale."
The Hooffields and McColts,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,fluttershy,Good plan. [to mice] That's why she's the princess.
The Hooffields and McColts,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,"In the meantime, could you please call off the pumpkining?"
The Hooffields and McColts,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,"Thanks. C'mon, Fluttershy."
The Hooffields and McColts,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,"There are four Alicorn princesses in Equestria now. I am Twilight Sparkle, the Princess of Friendship."
The Hooffields and McColts,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,fluttershy,And I'm Fluttershy.
The Hooffields and McColts,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,We are not spies! [to Fluttershy] Why does everypony assume we're spies?
The Hooffields and McColts,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,"Well, actually, that's why we're here <U+0096> to solve your problem with the Hooffields."
The Hooffields and McColts,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,No! That's not what I meant at all!
The Hooffields and McColts,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,We are not on anypony's side. We're here to help you become friends again.
The Hooffields and McColts,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,But you could be! They're just really upset you ruined their farmhouse.
The Hooffields and McColts,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,"Have you tried meeting at a neutral location, talking about your problems, and really listening to each other?"
The Hooffields and McColts,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,"Well, they'll listen to me. I'm an impartial third party."
The Hooffields and McColts,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,"[voice amplified] Attention, Hooffields and McColts! I'm not on anypony's side, but I can see you're both wasting time and resources on being mean to each other. Ponies are supposed to help each other and be kind. So let's stop this senseless fighting! [speaking normally] There. That should do it. Ready to go home, Fluttershy?"
The Hooffields and McColts,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,fluttershy,"I'd love to. But if we solved the problem already, shouldn't our cutie marks be glowing again?"
The Hooffields and McColts,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,"Oh, yeah. They should be glowing any minute now..."
The Hooffields and McColts,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,Or not.
The Hooffields and McColts,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,So much for potential friendship solution number twenty-eight.
The Hooffields and McColts,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,fluttershy,I guess we should find out why the Hooffields are launching tomatoes now.
The Hooffields and McColts,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,What are you doing? I asked you to stop fighting.
The Hooffields and McColts,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,fluttershy,Bleh!
The Hooffields and McColts,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,"Well, that didn't work. I was so sure it would."
The Hooffields and McColts,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,fluttershy,[gasps] It was a good plan. We need to think of another one. And soon. This fight is really affecting the animals around here.
The Hooffields and McColts,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,"Not to worry. I'll just, uh..."
The Hooffields and McColts,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,...find the root of the problem and work from there.
The Hooffields and McColts,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,"Pardon us, Ma, but do you remember what started this whole feud in the first place?"
The Hooffields and McColts,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,I'm starting to think neither of you know what either of you have done.
The Hooffields and McColts,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,"Okay, backup plan to the backup plan. Maybe we can find some common ground that you can bond over. What do you do when you're not fighting?"
The Hooffields and McColts,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,fluttershy,What do you hope to get out of fighting?
The Hooffields and McColts,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,Of winning what?
The Hooffields and McColts,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,fluttershy,The best at what?
The Hooffields and McColts,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,"So the only thing they have in common is that they both want to win a fight, and neither of them know what it's over. How can I end this feud if I don't know what it's about?"
The Hooffields and McColts,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,fluttershy,Ooh! Maybe somepony just needs to say they're sorry.
The Hooffields and McColts,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,That's a good idea. And friendship solution number forty-eight. But we can move it up.
The Hooffields and McColts,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,"I'm so glad you agreed to do this. This apology cake will go a long way to making amends between you two. Which part of my argument changed your mind? The part where I said the benefits of friendship outweigh the cost of war, or the part where I said forgiveness is an investment in happiness?"
The Hooffields and McColts,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,Wait. Are you even listening to me?
The Hooffields and McColts,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,Think of this as more than just a cake. It's the first step in the long road to forgiveness.
The Hooffields and McColts,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,fluttershy,"Nothing says ""let's be friends"" like a cake that says, ""Let's be friends!"" [hushed] I wrote that in icing on the top."
The Hooffields and McColts,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,"Ma Hooffield, you planted ponies in that cake?!"
The Hooffields and McColts,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,fluttershy,"Um, if you could just not yell so much or maybe stop saying words altogether..."
The Hooffields and McColts,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,fluttershy,Wah! Twilight?
The Hooffields and McColts,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,fluttershy,"Um, Twilight? We should probably get back there. I mean, if you need a break, that's fine, but I really can't do this without you."
The Hooffields and McColts,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,"I don't know if we can do this at all. Even if I make things right, they're just gonna fight again."
The Hooffields and McColts,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,fluttershy,"Hey, little fellas. Oh, that's okay, you can come out."
The Hooffields and McColts,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,What was that?
The Hooffields and McColts,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,fluttershy,"Oh, you poor things! There isn't enough food here for you! Oh, brrr, and you're freezing! I'm gonna take you all home with me and get you all hot cocoas. How do you feel about book clubs?"
The Hooffields and McColts,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,I don't get it. This was supposed to be the most beautiful valley in all of Equestria. What happened?
The Hooffields and McColts,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,fluttershy,What's that? Oh! Uh-huh... Twilight! They know what happened here!
The Hooffields and McColts,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,What?
The Hooffields and McColts,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,Stop! You have to listen to me!
The Hooffields and McColts,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,[straining] Fluttershy! You have to tell them! [strains] It's a lot harder to freeze an army of ponies than just six of them!
The Hooffields and McColts,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,fluttershy,"[raised voice] Before you keep fighting, there is something you should know! Long ago, there were two best friends..."
The Hooffields and McColts,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,fluttershy,"[voiceover] ...Grub Hooffield and Piles McColt. When they found the valley between the Smokey Mountains, they knew it was something special. So they made a promise to each other to protect and preserve the valley for all its adorable furry inhabitants. But they disagreed on how to go about it. Grub wanted to start by planting crops so that everypony would have something to eat. But Piles thought it would be better to start by building a shelter to protect them against the cold and wind. The two ponies were unable to come to an understanding, so Piles went ahead and built a shelter anyway, exactly where Grub was gonna start his farm! Grub was upset, so he tore down Piles' shelter so he could plant his crops!"
The Hooffields and McColts,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,fluttershy,"[voiceover] They kept fighting back and forth, until it turned into a feud!"
The Hooffields and McColts,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,fluttershy,"[voiceover] The valley suffered from the constant destruction, until finally the Hooffields and McColts moved to separate mountains."
The Hooffields and McColts,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,fluttershy,"Even then, the valley and all the animals in it continued to be caught in the crossfire. You see? By fighting, you're destroying the very thing that brought you here in the first place! So it's time you both put your differences aside and come together! If not for yourselves, then for the sake of these cute and cuddly guys!"
The Hooffields and McColts,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,fluttershy,They say they accept your apology.
The Hooffields and McColts,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,"[straining] Oh, right!"
The Hooffields and McColts,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,This is wonderful! I am so proud of you two!
The Hooffields and McColts,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,fluttershy,Yay! I told you we'd figure it out.
The Hooffields and McColts,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,"We did, and we didn't need my friendship portfolio to do it. We just needed each other. So, what do you think will happen next? We've all been called by the map now."
The Hooffields and McColts,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,fluttershy,Oof! [straining] I'm sure we'll find out when we get home...
The Hooffields and McColts,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,"What if it summons all six of us to another place? Or another pony we weren't expecting? [gasps] What if it wants us to solve other kinds of problems, like quantum physics, or why the apple doesn't fall far from the tree?"
The Mane Attraction,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"Wow, Applejack! Are you sure you've never managed a concert before?"
The Mane Attraction,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"Well, it turns out doin' up a concert's the same as settin' up a rodeo."
The Mane Attraction,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"And thanks to Pinkie's connections organizing the Ponypalooza Rock Concert, we've got quite a lineup for the Helping Hooves Music Festival."
The Mane Attraction,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"Twilight! Applejack! Rainbow Dash! Rarity! Fluttershy! Spike! Pinkie Pie! Oh wait, that's me. Everypony!"
The Mane Attraction,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"What is it, Pinkie?"
The Mane Attraction,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,I have the most amazing news ever! It is totally gonna freak your frizz!
The Mane Attraction,Amy Keating Rogers,rainbow dash,"Well, spill it, Pinkie!"
The Mane Attraction,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"It wasn't easy. In fact, it was terribly difficult. But I have managed to book the biggest pony pop star in all of Equestria as the main attraction of the Helping Hooves Music Festival!"
The Mane Attraction,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,Sapphire Shores?
The Mane Attraction,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"Sapphire Shores?! Please! Sapphire Shores is merely the second biggest pony pop star in Equestria. I have booked the one, the only, Countess Coloratura!"
The Mane Attraction,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,Who in the hay is Countess Coloratura?
The Mane Attraction,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,My frizz has been freaked!
The Mane Attraction,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"Pinkie Pie, who is this Countess Coloratura pony?"
The Mane Attraction,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"Uh, I just told you that she's the biggest pony pop star in Equestria! How-how-how-how-how have you not heard of her?!"
The Mane Attraction,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,Don't know. Though I did know a gal named Coloratura when I was just a filly. [laughs and snorts] Wouldn't it just be the funniest thing if that Coloratura and this Coloratura were the same Coloratura? Heh.
The Mane Attraction,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,Do you mean to tell me that you actually know Countess Coloratura?
The Mane Attraction,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"Well, I don't think it's the same pony, since my friend wasn't any sort of high-falutin' countess."
The Mane Attraction,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,Do you remember her cutie mark?
The Mane Attraction,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,Sure do. It had this super colorful bunch of musical notes that just shimmered in the light.
The Mane Attraction,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,You mean... like this?!
The Mane Attraction,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"Well, fancy that! That there's the very same cutie mark!"
The Mane Attraction,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,Do you have any idea the number of hoops I had to jump through to get her to perform at the festival?! A whole lot of hoops! That pony is very demanding!
The Mane Attraction,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,Nah.
The Mane Attraction,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,Yah!
The Mane Attraction,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,I completely understand. We artistes require certain necessities in order to do our best work.
The Mane Attraction,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"This was clearly some sort of misunderstandin', 'cause Rara was just as down home as me!"
The Mane Attraction,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"Even that big name was too fancy for her, so I shortened Coloratura to ""Rara""!"
The Mane Attraction,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,[voiceover] We had the best time at Camp Friendship!
The Mane Attraction,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,[voiceover] Rara was just so easygoin'! We were like two apples from the same branch.
The Mane Attraction,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"[voiceover] Rara and I prepared this song for the camp talent show. When we performed, she belted it out, singin' in the most colorful, clear voice I'd ever heard!"
The Mane Attraction,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"[voiceover] After camp, we wrote to each other for a bit, but..."
The Mane Attraction,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"...then we lost touch. But Rara always did want to go to Manehattan to try and make it big. But a demandin' diva? Just you wait, Pinkie. Once Rara gets here, you'll see she's just a plain old pony like you and me."
The Mane Attraction,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,I don't have to wait <U+0096> she's here!
The Mane Attraction,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,Really?
The Mane Attraction,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,Rara?
The Mane Attraction,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,[squealing] Countess Coloratura!
The Mane Attraction,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"No... that can't be her. [clears throat] Um... hi. Remember me? We met at Camp Friendship? I gave you the nickname ""Rara""?"
The Mane Attraction,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"Yeah! Heh. Howdy, Rara!"
The Mane Attraction,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,"Ooh, you got hoofsies from Countess Coloratura! Look! Ooh, she clearly thinks you're very special!"
The Mane Attraction,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,Yeah... real special.
The Mane Attraction,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"Ooh! I'm the pony Pinkie Pie, Mr. Manager, sir!"
The Mane Attraction,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,I have twenty glass containers full right here!
The Mane Attraction,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"Uh, I don't think so. But lucky for you, I have the biggest straw collection in Equestria! I call this straw Fernando."
The Mane Attraction,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"Ooh, we shall!"
The Mane Attraction,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,Abso-toot-ly!
The Mane Attraction,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"See, Applejack? Demanding!"
The Mane Attraction,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"Pinkie's right, Rarity! The Rara I knew didn't hide behind a veil givin' out fake stamp kisses, sippin' up imported water, and needin' her cherries separated."
The Mane Attraction,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,"Oh, I do understand. Sometimes it's hard to see our friends change."
The Mane Attraction,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,She's become a whole other pony!
The Mane Attraction,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,"Trust me. Once you see Countess Coloratura perform, you simply won't believe it!"
The Mane Attraction,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,Rarity was right! I don't believe it!
The Mane Attraction,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"Correct me if I'm wrong here, but that feller isn't actually complimentin' Rara. He's complimentin' all the bells and whistles he's piled on to make her Countess Coloratura."
The Mane Attraction,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,"Oh, no-no-no-no-no, you don't understand, Applejack. Creating all those elements is a lot of work, and Countess Coloratura's performance wouldn't exist without them."
The Mane Attraction,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"If you ask me, that wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing."
The Mane Attraction,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"Actually, right now you're scheduled for your meet and greet with the schoolponies!"
The Mane Attraction,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"The schoolponies'll be so happy to hear that, Rara!"
The Mane Attraction,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,Now that's more like the Rara I remember.
The Mane Attraction,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,[distant] But... I got everything you requested!
The Mane Attraction,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"Oh! Well, we have lots of tasty oats right here in Ponyville!"
The Mane Attraction,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,[gasps] But that's impossible!
The Mane Attraction,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,Applejack! Svengallop just made all of these new demands and he said<U+0097>
The Mane Attraction,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"I heard, Pinkie. But don't you fret. I'll talk to Rara and fix things right up."
The Mane Attraction,Amy Keating Rogers,apple bloom,"Did'ja see, sis?! Did'ja see?!"
The Mane Attraction,Amy Keating Rogers,apple bloom,"Hold on, Applejack. You wrote to Countess Coloratura about me?!"
The Mane Attraction,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"Alright now, you'd best get along, little ponies."
The Mane Attraction,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"Uh... Hey, Rara, you mind if I talk to you about your manager?"
The Mane Attraction,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"Well, while you were meetin' with the schoolponies, he was demandin' all sorts of stuff from Pinkie Pie."
The Mane Attraction,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"Well, do you see somethin' wrong with him tellin' Pinkie that if she doesn't get those things by tomorrow, he'd pull you from our charity festival?"
The Mane Attraction,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,I'm afraid Svengallop doesn't give a pickled pippin about your charity work.
The Mane Attraction,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"Jealous of what? A pony who hides behind a veil so thick she can't see when somepony's usin' her? No, I'm not jealous of that, Rara!"
The Mane Attraction,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"It just ain't right! He's manipulatin' her, and she's just not seein' it!"
The Mane Attraction,Amy Keating Rogers,pinkie pie,"Enough stewin', more peelin'!"
The Mane Attraction,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"Sorry, Pinkie, but there is no way I'm lettin' that lousy Svengallop use my friend like that!"
The Mane Attraction,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,Countess Coloratura!
The Mane Attraction,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"I said your new name, but I saw the real you hangin' out with those schoolponies yesterday. And I know somepony that'd prefer if you stop doin' those little events."
The Mane Attraction,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,Come on now. You've just got to give me a chance to prove what I'm sayin' is true.
The Mane Attraction,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,Do exactly what I say. We'll see if that Svengallop truly has your best interests at heart.
The Mane Attraction,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"Oh, Rara, I'm so sorry. Are you gonna be okay for the concert tonight?"
The Mane Attraction,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"Can you give us a minute, Rarity?"
The Mane Attraction,Amy Keating Rogers,rarity,Certainly.
The Mane Attraction,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"Now, why's it gonna be so terrible?"
The Mane Attraction,Amy Keating Rogers,applejack,"Now, now, don't go gettin' yourself into a tizzy there, Rara. Svengallop turned you into Countess Coloratura and acted like your friend so he could enjoy the perks that came with bein' a star. But the real perk of friendship is gettin' to see your friend bein' true to their self. And Rara, when you're simply yourself, you're the brightest star I've ever seen shine."
The Mane Attraction,Amy Keating Rogers,twilight sparkle,"Good evening, everypony! Welcome to opening night of the Helping Hooves Music Festival! Now it is my great honor to introduce you to our headlining act <U+0096> Countess Coloratura!"
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"If somepony had told me when I was a blank flank that one day I'd give a speech to a class at Celestia's School of Magic, I wouldn't have believed it, but..."
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"I hope that I have been up to the task, because I can tell that all of you are and that the future of Equestrian magic is in good hooves."
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"Eh, I don't know, Spike. I'd like to be able to get through the whole speech without looking at the cards."
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,spike,"Come on, Twilight! You can't be nervous about giving a speech to a bunch of magic students!"
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"Oh, I'm not nervous, Spike, but I do have to set a good example, especially for magic students. That's why this speech has to be..."
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,spike,[sighs] Perfect?
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"Exactly. Let's go through it one more time. [clears throat] When Princess Celestia asked me to speak to you today, I was honored to have the opportunity to talk about my favorite subject: magic."
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"Obviously, the long term effects of..."
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"...the simultaneous acquisition of cutie marks has yet to be determined, but... [sips water] Ahem. Next slide, please."
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,spike,[snoring] Huh? Huh!
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"I can speak from my own experience that the power of Cutie Mark Magic is very real, and in the instance of my friends and I, it can be traced to a single event! Without Rainbow Dash's race to defend Fluttershy's honor, this rainboom wouldn't have happened. Fluttershy might never have discovered her love of animals. Applejack might never have realized that she belonged on her farm. And Pinkie Pie might never have decided to leave hers. It might be hard to imagine Rarity without her sense of fabulousness. But it's even harder to fathom what my life would be like. Without this rainboom, I might not have gotten into magic school. Celestia wouldn't have taken me on as her pupil or sent me to Ponyville to meet my friends. And the most powerful thing about Cutie Mark Magic that I found is the connection I share with them."
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"But, um..."
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,The real question about... Cutie Mark Magic is... who it seems to affect.
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,spike,Starlight Glimmer?
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"I was sure I saw her, Spike. But when I looked again, she was gone! I'm just worried what she could be up to."
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,spike,"Nothing good, I bet. I heard she wasn't very happy the last time you saw her."
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,Forcing everypony in her village to have the same cutie mark wasn't right. We had to do something!
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,spike,"And now she's coming back for revenge. Uh, or she was just really interested in your speech!"
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"Honestly, Spike. I'm not really sure what I saw. But as long as I have my friends, I know everything will be all right."
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,Maybe I was just more stressed about that speech than I thought.
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,spike,Yeah. That sounds better than Starlight Glimmer coming back with an evil plot for revenge.
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"Well, when you say it like that, it does sound kinda silly."
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,spike,Or it's totally true!
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,"Welcome home, Twilight!"
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"What are you doing, Starlight?"
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,spike,Where'd she go?
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"I don't know, Spike, but I think we better find out!"
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,spike,I guess we could start with this.
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"Spike, no! Don't touch that!"
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,spike,[continued screaming] Cloudsdale? Starlight doesn't even have wings! Why would she come here?
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"I don't know, Spike, but it looked like she could fly with just magic! Keep your eyes open. We don't know what she has planned."
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,spike,Isn't that Rainbow Dash?
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,Did Rainbow Dash look really young to you? And I didn't see a cutie mark. You don't think...
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,spike,...We traveled back in time to when Rainbow Dash raced the bullies who made fun of Fluttershy and performed her first sonic rainboom?
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"Spike, only Star Swirl the Bearded could do something like that, and even his spell just went back a week! How could Starlight do more than the greatest wizard in Equestria?"
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,spike,With this.
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"Star Swirl's spell! Oh, no!"
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,spike,"Come on, let's go!"
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,Go where?
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,spike,To watch the race. I don't wanna miss the rainboom! Whoa!
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,young rainbow dash,Whoa!
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,young rainbow dash,Hey!
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,"Aw, sorry about this."
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,young rainbow dash,Hey! What gives?
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,What did you do?!
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,You are about to find out.
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"Ugh... I don't know what Starlight's up to yet, but we'd better figure it out before it's too late."
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,spike,"Um, Twilight? I think it already is."
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,spike,"Uh, Twilight? Where's your castle?"
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"The map pulled us back, but whatever Starlight did in the past changed things here!"
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,spike,But why? And how did we get here? Where's here?
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,More like when.
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,spike,What do you mean?
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"Starlight altered Star Swirl's spell, then somehow used it on the map to travel into the past and change something! Once she did, the map pulled us back to the present!"
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,spike,"So we're back where<U+0097> I mean, when we started?"
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,Not exactly. Everything's different. Look. The map doesn't even make sense anymore! The Crystal Empire takes up half of Equestria!
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,spike,Plus there's the whole missing castle thing.
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,Right! This is too big to handle on our own.
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,spike,You think?
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,We need to find our friends and get help!
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,spike,"I'm gettin' a bad feeling about this, Twilight."
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"I know, Spike, but this is Ponyville. How bad could things be?"
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,spike,Is that Sugarcube Corner?
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,I don't understand.
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,spike,[gasps] [panting] Rarity?
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,spike,[grunts] Rarity?!
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"I don't think she's here, Spike. I'm not sure anything we know is the same. But I know one place that could never change!"
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,Applejack?!
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,applejack,What can I do for you?
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"It's so good to see you! We couldn't find Pinkie or Rarity or Fluttershy or Rainbow Dash, but I just knew you'd still be here!"
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,applejack,Of course I am. This is my home. But who in tarnation is Pinkie Bow and Flutterdash? Or you for that matter?
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,You... don't know who I am?
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,applejack,"Nope. Honestly, the only name I recognize is Rarity, but she left for Manehattan years ago."
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,spike,"Probably to become a world-famous fashion designer, I bet."
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,applejack,"Not that I know of. Last I heard, she went to help with the cause like everypony else."
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,The cause?
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,applejack,The war against King Sombra and the Crystal Empire?
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,applejack,Where have you two been?
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,spike,"Actually, it's when."
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"I know this is hard to believe, but you and I and those other ponies I mentioned are friends!"
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,applejack,Did you bump your head on a crate of cider or somethin'?
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"I'm telling you the truth! And if you come with me, I'll prove it."
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,applejack,"Well, I'll admit. I've lived in these parts my whole life and I've never seen this before."
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,spike,There's also supposed to be a castle that goes with it.
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,applejack,But I still don't see what this has to do with you and I bein' friends.
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"Another pony named Starlight Glimmer used this map to travel through time and change things in the past. For some reason, the map's here but everything else is different!"
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,applejack,Different how?
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"Well, for one thing, where we came from, there's no war with King Sombra. Maybe you could tell us how the war started, then we can figure out when everything changed!"
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,applejack,"That's easy enough. [sighs] When the Crystal Empire returned, it brought King Sombra back with it."
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,applejack,[voiceover] And it didn't take long for him to force every one of his subjects to fight for him against Equestria.
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,applejack,"[voiceover] And even with Princess Celestia leadin' the charge, it still takes every last pony in Equestria doin' their part, workin' day and night, to keep up the fight."
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,I just can't believe it! We stopped King Sombra! You and me and all of our friends!
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,applejack,But we aren't friends. At least not here.
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,Right.
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,applejack,"Look. I hope all this helped, but I really need to get back to cannin' those apples."
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,Thank you. We're going to set things right.
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,applejack,[sighs] I hope you do.
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,spike,So... how are we gonna set things right?
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,I don't know! The only thing we know for sure is that Starlight stopped the rainboom.
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,spike,And that the map's still here.
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"[gasps] Spike, that's it! The map is connected to the Tree of Harmony! It must sense that something isn't right! That's why it's still here! I'll just use Starlight's version of the spell and go back a little earlier and stop her before she even knows we're there!"
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,All we have to do now is find Starlight and<U+0097>
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,"Well, finding her will be easy! But stopping her's gonna be harder than you think. Sorry to disappoint you, but I created that spell to send myself back in time. So even when you cast it, I still get sent back here. It wasn't difficult to change Star Swirl's spell. He'd already done the hard part. But figuring out I could use the map to go to any time or place and pull you along with me? [short laugh] I even impressed myself with that. I knew you'd try to stop me. You're so predictable. Why else would I leave the scroll behind? Touching it triggered the map to whisk you here and watch me erase the one thing that linked you with your friends! My village was a sanctuary of equality, where nopony's cutie mark allowed them to feel superior! It was a special place, and you and your friends took it away!"
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,"Now it's my turn to take something special from you! Without the rainboom, you and your friends will never form your special cutie mark bonds! Cutie marks for cutie marks! Sounds like a fair trade to me!"
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,spike,Twiliiiiiiight!
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,Oops!
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,spike,[screaming] Thanks!
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"No problem, Spike. At least now we know exactly what we have to do!"
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"Okay, keep your eyes peeled."
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,spike,Right!
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,We have to stop Starlight as soon as Rainbow Dash and those bullies race by!
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,spike,"Um, Twilight?"
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,So be ready.
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,spike,"I know, but<U+0097>"
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,Because she could pop up anywhere!
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,spike,Like over there?
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,Just remember how you'd feel if someone said those things to you.
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,What's going on here?
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,"Oh, I was just reminding these two colts how hurtful teasing can be."
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"Well, don't!"
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,I mean... you were?
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,"Of course! In a world where everypony is unique, some are bound to feel more special than others. But that isn't a license to be cruel, is it?"
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"No, of course not..."
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,"Oh, isn't it a shame we don't live in a world where everypony is equal? No one would ever tease anyone there! Wouldn't that be nice?"
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"No, it wouldn't! I mean, it'd be nice not to be teased, of course, but that's not the same thing!"
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,I know you only convinced those bullies to not tease Fluttershy to stop the rainboom!
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,"Oh, that's not true. I convinced them not to be bullies because everypony should be equal. Stopping the rainboom is just a bonus."
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,spike,Look!
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,This isn't over yet!
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,If you say so!
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,Hi!
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,young rainbow dash,Um... hi?
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,You think you can stop for a minute?
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,young rainbow dash,Sure.
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,I hear you're pretty fast!
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,young rainbow dash,Pretty fast? Please! I'm even faster than that!
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"Okay, so, um, hey, you want to race?"
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,young rainbow dash,"Um, that wouldn't really be fair. I mean, you're a full-grown pony, and... Wait. Are you an Alicorn?"
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"Come on, I thought you were fast!"
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,young rainbow dash,"Uh, actually, I just remembered I have somewhere I need to be."
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"Okay, listen. You don't have to race me. I just need you to fly fast enough for a sonic rainboom!"
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,young rainbow dash,What?! I can't do that! Nopony can! It's not even a real thing! It's just an old mare's tale!
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,But it's not! I know it's not! I've seen you do it! In the future!
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,young rainbow dash,Ooookay... I'm gonna go now.
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,No! Wait!
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,"Gee, Twilight, what's the matter? Couldn't convince her to do the impossible? That's too bad."
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,spike,"Ugh. Well, that didn't work."
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,This is gonna be harder than I thought. We'll have to try again!
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,spike,"Hey, Twilight?"
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,I don't want to live in that awful future we saw!
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,spike,I don't think you'll have to!
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,Pinkie? Fluttershy?
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,pinkie pie,"Silence, changeling!"
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1,Josh Haber,fluttershy,All servants of Queen Chrysalis found in these woods must be... destroyed!
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,spike,Starlight Glimmer?
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"I was sure I saw her, Spike!"
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,"Welcome home, Twilight!"
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,spike,We traveled back in time to when Rainbow Dash performed her first sonic rainboom?
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,"Without the rainboom, you and your friends will never form your special cutie mark bond!"
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,But whatever Starlight did in the past changed things here!
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,I don't want to live in that awful future we saw!
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,spike,I don't think you'll have to.
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,fluttershy,All servants of Queen Chrysalis found in these woods must be... destroyed!
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,Wait! We're not changelings! I'm a pony! And he's a dragon!
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,pinkie pie,A likely story! Do something dragonish!
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,pinkie pie,[wheezes] That works!
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,fluttershy,The servants of Chrysalis will do anything to save their evil skins!
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,zecora,Stop! If they are changelings we'll soon see. Though I think they're not what they appear to be.
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"Zecora! Please, you have to listen."
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,zecora,"Beneath this salve, no changeling hides, for it reveals the truth inside."
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,pinkie pie,What does it mean?
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,zecora,"The meaning is far worse, I see, for it is we who should not be."
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,I think I can explain.
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,zecora,"I'm sure you can, but let's not talk here. Chrysalis and her army will soon draw near!"
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,zecora,The changelings took over not long ago. Though I'll wager in your world that isn't so.
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"Chrysalis and her army tried to take over Canterlot, but my friends and I stopped her."
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,zecora,"Those friends as you know them are not here, alas. But tell me how all this came to pass."
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"Starlight Glimmer, a pony who traveled back in time to stop my friends and me from ever coming together!"
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,zecora,And it is these friends you have in life that keep Equestria free from strife?
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"I guess so. But this is the second time I've come back and this world is even worse than the last one! If Starlight keeps doing the same thing in the past, how could the present be so different?"
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,zecora,"Ah. Time is a river, where even the tiniest changes seen can lead to a cascade of effects downstream."
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,zecora,"This part of the forest is dark and damp, but it's done well to hide our camp."
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,spike,This is cozy.
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,rarity,[shrieks] Please! You have to help us!
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,rainbow dash,The changelings attacked Ponyville! We barely escaped with our lives!
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,zecora,The only changeling attack I see is the one that come here looking for me!
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,queen chrysalis,"[laughs] What a lovely village you've chosen to stage your little resistance. It looks absolutely delicious! [slurping] Oh, come now, Zecora. You're vastly outnumbered."
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,queen chrysalis,I know you don't want your charges hurt. Come quietly to the dungeons of Canterlot and I promise to leave the others alone.
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,fluttershy,Why would she ever trust you?!
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"Even if there's a chance Chrysalis will honor her word, shouldn't you try?"
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,zecora,[hushed] Race to the map while we hold off their attack. Stop Starlight and put the whole world back on track!
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,queen chrysalis,"Time to make a decision, Zecora!"
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,"Not bad, but it's gonna take a lot more than that!"
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"Lucky for you, there's more where that came from!"
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,You've really gotta work on your aim.
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,What are you doing? You have to finish your race!
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,young rainbow dash,No way! This is way more exciting!
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,See? You can't stop me no matter what you do.
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,young rainbow dash,"Aw, man."
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,spike,That's strange.
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"Well, you obviously don't mean us falling, because that's becoming pretty routine."
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,spike,"No, it's just the other times we've come back, it's been day! But look!"
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,Why would the map bring us back to a different time of day than when we left?
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,spike,"Um, maybe we should figure it out later!"
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,[gasps] The Castle of the Two Sisters!
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,spike,"Well, don't just stand here!"
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,spike,This place looks a lot cleaner than I remember.
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,Rarity?
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,rarity,The castle isn't open for viewings today. The tapestries all need changing. Again.
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,spike,"Rarity, it's me!"
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,rarity,I don't socialize with dragons. I don't know anypony who would.
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"Rarity, you have to listen to me! The future of Equestria's at stake!"
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,rarity,"I don't know how you know my name, but I am far too busy to entertain some tourist's ridiculous fantasies."
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"I have to get back to the map so I can stop Starlight from changing the past, because every present I come to is worse than the last!"
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,nightmare moon,"Time travel, you say? Now that's something I would like to see."
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,nightmare moon,[laughing] Tell me how you came by this magic to travel through time.
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,rainbow dash,"The princess asked you a question! And unless you wanna end up in the dungeon, you'll tell her what she wants to know!"
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,nightmare moon,Nopony in my kingdom but me should possess a magic powerful enough to change time.
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,spike,Your kingdom?
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,nightmare moon,Who else?
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,spike,"Um... Celestia, of course!"
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,nightmare moon,"[laughing] My sister has been imprisoned in the moon for years! But it is no less a fate than she'd sentence me to! Now, reveal to me the source of this time magic!"
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,...Alright.
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,spike,"Twilight, no!"
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"We have no choice, Spike. [to Nightmare Moon] I can take you to it, but you'll have to get past the timberwolves."
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,nightmare moon,I am the ruler of all of Equestria. Do you think I can't deal with timberwolves?
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,No. I know you can.
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,nightmare moon,And if you were thinking of trying to escape...
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,nightmare moon,...it would be very unfortunate for your friend.
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,nightmare moon,How does it work?
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,A pony from my time used this spell to travel back and change the past.
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,nightmare moon,"And now you will give this spell to me! With it, I will ensure that the Elements of Harmony are never found and my reign lasts forever!"
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,But it won't.
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,nightmare moon,What?!
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"In my world, my friends and I found the Elements and used them to defeat you! And I will do everything in my power to bring that world back!"
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,nightmare moon,No!
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,nightmare moon,Noooooo!
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,Now more than ever I know how important it is to stop you!
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,"Well, good luck!"
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,young rainbow dash,Whoooaaaa!
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,"Up for another race-ending fight, Twilight?"
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,No. You were right. I can't stop you.
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"But you can't stop me from trying, and we could be stuck doing this for all eternity!"
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,"If that's what it takes to keep you and your friends from getting your cutie mark connection, then I'm game!"
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,What you're doing goes way beyond cutie marks! Everything we do here in the past <U+0096> even the smallest change <U+0096> can snowball into an avalanche of trouble for the future!
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,"Oh, next I suppose you'll tell me that ""the fate of all of Equestria hangs in the balance""!"
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,It does!
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,"Spare me your overblown ego! No group of friends, not even Princess Twilight's, is that important!"
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,young rainbow dash,Aaaaaaah!
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"I don't know how important other ponies' friendships are to the future, but I can show you what the world is like without mine!"
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,Where are we?!
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"The future. Or rather, the present."
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,But there's nothing here!
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"I wish I could say I was surprised. But every world I come back to is worse than the last. I don't know why my friends and I are so important to Equestria, but we are."
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,I don't believe you!
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,spike,"Come on, Starlight, look around!"
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"Like I said, everything in the past affects the future, even the tiniest act. And what you're doing leads here. I know I can't stop you, but I thought showing you this might change your mind."
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,Change my mind? You don't know anything about me! I was perfectly happy before you and your friends ruined what I built!
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"I don't know what happened that led you to make your village without cutie marks, and I'm sorry my friends and I had to take it away."
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,You want to know what happened to me?! I'll show you!
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,Where are we?
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,"That map of yours is connected to every part of Equestria, and this part is my home."
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,"Sunburst and I did everything together. In fact, I don't remember us ever being apart. Until today."
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,"And just like that, my friend was gone. His family recognized his magical talent and sent him off to Canterlot. I never saw him again."
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,spike,"Well, why not?"
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,"Because of his cutie mark! He got his, and I didn't! He moved on, and I didn't! I stayed here and never made another friend because I was too afraid another cutie mark would take them away, too!"
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,That's ridiculous. A cutie mark can't take your friends away.
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,Not everypony's lucky enough to get her cutie mark at the same time as her friends!
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,"You don't know what it's like to lose a friend because of a cutie mark. But once I stop the rainboom, you will!"
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,"And when I destroy this scroll, there'll be no way for you to change it!"
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"Starlight, you're right! I don't know what you went through! But I do know you can't do this! I've seen where this leads, and so have you!"
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,I only saw what you showed me! Who knows what'll really happen?
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,I've seen it a dozen times! Things don't turn out well in Equestria without my friends!
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,Ugh! What's so special about your friends?! How can a group of ponies that are so different be so important?!
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,The differences between me and my friends are the very things that make our friendship strong!
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,"I thought Sunburst and I were the same. But we turned out different, and it tore our friendship apart!"
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"So try again! Make new friends! And if something that you can't control happens that changes things, work through it together! That's what friendship is! And it's not just my friendships that are important to Equestria! Everypony's are! When yours ended, it led us here. But just imagine all the others that are out there waiting for you if you just give them a chance!"
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,How do I know they won't all end the same way?
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,I guess it's up to you to make sure they don't.
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,spike,[kissing] One Castle of Friendship <U+0096> check!
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,rarity,What in Equestria was that?!
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,fluttershy,Is everypony okay?
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,pinkie pie,[squeals] Can you do it again?
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,spike,One group of amazing friends <U+0096> check!
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"Yeah, Spike. It looks like we're home!"
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,applejack,Uh... what's she doin' here?
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"Actually, it's kind of a long story."
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,rainbow dash,"I mean, I knew my rainboom was awesome, but I never thought all of Equestria depended on it!"
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,pinkie pie,Or on us!
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"I think it's more than that. Friendship connects all of Equestria, and undoing one group of friends made its magic less powerful."
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,applejack,I can't believe y'all were able to travel through time like that.
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,pinkie pie,That Starlight must be pretty magical!
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"She obviously has more talent for magic than almost anypony I've seen. My magic couldn't stop her. I had to convince her to stop on her own. Once I realized that, everything fell into place."
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,applejack,"But if she's as powerful as all that, we can't just send her on her way, can we?"
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"Actually, I kind of have something else in mind."
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,"[gulps, exhales] I know there's no excuse for what I did, but I want you all to know that I'm ready for whatever punishment you think is fair."
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"I've been thinking a lot about how badly Equestria fared without just one group of friends. Because even when one friendship dies, the results can be disastrous."
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,I know first-hoof how true that can be.
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"And that's why I've asked you here. If you're willing to learn, I'm willing to teach you what I know. You'll have the power to make Equestria an even better place."
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,[hushed] How do I start?
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,Starting is easy! All you have to do is make a friend! And you've got seven of them right here.
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,I never thought that I would find a place To step right in and start again I never thought that I could just begin Right where I left off and make a friend
The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"Don't ever think that it might be too late You don't have to wait, there's no mistakes with the friends you make A friendship's only made of what you bring And if you do it right, you can do anything"
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,[sighs] Okay. Library... Library... Where did they put the library?
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,[sighs] This castle looked a lot smaller from the outside.
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,spike,"[muffled] Morning, Starlight!"
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,Whoops!
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,"Sorry, Spike! I guess I'm still trying to find my way around. You don't happen to know where the library is, do you?"
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,spike,[muffled] Next door on the left!
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,Oh. Thanks!
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"Acceptance, mm-hmm. Altruism, definitely. Starlight, good morning, come in!"
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,Sorry I'm late. I got a little turned around. I still can't believe you're letting me stay here... as your pupil... after everything I did.
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"Well, I'm not one to dwell on the past, and neither should you. The castle is your home now, and as far as being my pupil goes, I was just trying to figure out what your first friendship lesson should be!"
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,"Oh, well, it looks like you're really narrowing it down!"
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"Oh, these are just the A's. After this, I move on to the B's!"
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,"I know I'm just learning about friendship, but I didn't think there were this many lessons for anything. How do we choose?"
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,Maybe I should pare things down a bit before we go through them. Why don't you join the others in the throne room? They're planning our trip to the Crystal Empire when Shining Armor and Princess Cadance have their baby!
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,rainbow dash,"Well, I think we should leave ASAP. I don't want to miss the Crystalling!"
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,fluttershy,"But, um, shouldn't we wait for the invitation?"
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,applejack,"Frankly, I'm not exactly clear on all the customs and traditions of the Crystal Empire, especially when it comes to a Crystalling."
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,What's a Crystalling?
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,rarity,"Well, that's just it, darling. Princess Cadance and Shining Armor's baby is due any day, and we're still not sure. The Crystal Empire was gone for a thousand years. A lot of their customs are a bit murky."
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,applejack,We know it's got somethin' to do with the new baby.
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,pinkie pie,[quickly] And a party!
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,fluttershy,And the Crystal Heart.
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,pinkie pie,[quickly] And a party!
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,rainbow dash,And some kinda cool energy.
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,pinkie pie,And... a party!
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,spike,"It's not hard to understand. Most things in the Crystal Empire aren't. Like how I'm a big hero there, for example!"
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,spike,"Eh... plus, I've had to help Twilight do a lot of research on Crystallings. Whenever a baby is born in the Crystal Empire, the parents bring it before the Crystal Heart. They get the purest shard of crystal they can find, then pick a crystaller to present the baby to everypony who comes. Then they all share the light and joy they feel, feeding it into the crystal that joins with the Heart, and increases its power! And this is going to be a royal Crystalling, so pretty much the whole empire will show up. That hasn't happened in a millennia!"
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,What do you mean it increases the Crystal Heart's power?
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,spike,"The energy it uses to protect the Crystal Empire, I guess."
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,Protect it from what?
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,spike,I... didn't help Twilight with that part.
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,"Hey, Twilight, can I ask you something about the Crystal Empire?"
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"Huh! Funny you should mention it. Because I just narrowed your first friendship lesson down to three options, and one of them is in the Crystal Empire!"
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,Really?
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,I found out that's where the first pony you ever cared about lives!
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,Sunburst?
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"Of course, that's just one idea. We could also go to Griffonstone. [begins fading out] Making friends with a griffon is a challenge all by itself! Or we could tag along with the CMC's the next time they try to help a pony figure out why they're special..."
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,[normal] Starlight? Is something wrong?
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,"What? O-Oh, no, heh, those all sound great!"
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,I know! I guess you were right <U+0096> it is gonna be hard to choose one!
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,[laughs nervously] ...Yeah.
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,Ugh! I am never gonna find my way around this place!
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,spike,"Gee, Starlight, what's wrong?"
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,"I don't know, Spike. Twilight's figuring out what my first friendship lesson is, and I guess I'm not exactly thrilled with the options. Well... with one of them."
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,spike,Which one?
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,Reuniting me with my first friend.
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,spike,What's so terrible about that?
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,"[sighs] [narrating] When we were foals, Sunburst knew everything there was to know about magic. He always knew just what to do. And he was always there to help me. I guess it's not surprising that Sunburst got his cutie mark in magic and... went off to Princess Celestia's school. But when he left..."
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,spike,"You blamed cutie marks and stripped a whole village of theirs, and when Twilight and the others stopped you, you went back in time and almost destroyed Equestria."
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,"Not really stuff I'm super eager to tell Sunburst about. I mean, he's probably some big important wizard now, and... I can't even find my way around Twilight's castle."
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,spike,"Well, if Sunburst is that good at magic, maybe he'd appreciate your, uh... [clears throat] exploits. You should talk to Twilight about it. I'm sure she'd want to hear what you have to say."
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,I know. But I don't want her to think I'm not ready to learn or that I'm not grateful for everything she's doing.
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,Spike! Come quick!
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,spike,It's a Crystalling invitation!
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"Shining Armor's a father! I'm an aunt! Well, this settles it! Since we're going to the Crystal Empire, your first friendship lesson is going to be... reuniting with Sunburst!"
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,Great...
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,rainbow dash,"[yawn] Um, Applejack, what is that?"
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,applejack,"Oh, just a little somethin' for the young'un. Made from genuine Sweet Apple Acres apple trees. We make 'em for all the Apples, and anypony related to Twilight is practically family."
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,rainbow dash,"Yeah, it's okay... But it's no Cloudsdale mobile! Bam!"
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,pinkie pie,Pretty!
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,applejack,"Well, a mobile is real nice... as long as you have somethin' to lay in so you can look at it."
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,rarity,And a fetching blanket to keep you warm.
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,I'm sure Shining Armor and Princess Cadance will love all our gifts. But I think they're more happy we'll be attending the baby's Crystalling.
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,pinkie pie,Ooh! I can't wait to see all that light and love make the Crystal Heart even more sparkly and shiny!
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"Actually, Pinkie, the Crystal Heart is an ancient and powerful relic. Without its magic, the Crystal Empire would be lost to the Frozen North."
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,"Wow, this Crystalling sounds pretty important. I'd understand if you wanted to... you know... wait to do a different friendship lesson when we get back."
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"Are you kidding? This trip is perfect! Not only do I get to see the baby and take part in the ceremony that helps maintain the magic of the Crystal Empire, but I'm starting my new pupil off with the most amazing friendship lesson ever! I can't wait!"
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,"Right... Me neither... [beat] Actually, Twilight, I am a little worried about meeting Sunburst."
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"Oh, trust me. I know what it's like to see old friends. But I'll be right there to help things along. I've broken the whole lesson down into a few easy steps to ensure this reunion goes off without a hitch!"
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"[reading] Step one, head to Sunburst's house and get you two started on the right hoof. Step two, get to the castle with enough time to visit the ba<U+0097>"
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,[gasps] Shining Armor!
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,shining armor,[tired] Twilight...!
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,I didn't know you were meeting us!
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,shining armor,"[tired] Of course I am! It's me, right here. Here I am. Why wouldn't I come meet my sister? Though we have met before, heh-heh..."
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,Are you all right?
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,shining armor,"[tired] Never better! Being a father is amazing! And wonderful, and amazing, and confusing, and amazing, but surprising too, you know? I mean, not that you'd know. You wouldn't know, I know... You know? [beat] Sorry. I haven't really slept since Cadance had the baby. Come to think of it, she hasn't either. It sure would be great to get a break."
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"Oh, of course! I don't know what I was thinking! You two probably need all kinds of help! I'm sorry, Starlight, but I guess combining your first lesson with this visit wasn't such a good idea."
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,"Oh, uh, don't be ridiculous! You're an aunt now! That's way more important than some friendship lesson."
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,I just wish there was a way to do both.
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,spike,Maybe there is! You've already done the work for Starlight's lesson with this list. All we have to do is follow it!
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"Spike, you're a genius!"
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,[through nervous laugh] Yeah... [through gritted teeth] genius.
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"Then it's settled! Shining Armor and I will head straight to the castle, and you two can head straight to Sunburst's!"
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,spike,"Aye-aye, Princess!"
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,[nervously] Uh-huh.
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"Alright, big brother, let's go see this amazing baby pony!"
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,shining armor,[snoring] Ahhh... the baby...
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,spike,"I know you're a little worried about this reunion, but I'm sure Twilight's got everything covered."
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,Everything except how I'd rather do absolutely anything else.
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,spike,"Oh, I bet she's taken that into account too. It's all part of the lesson. Trust the lesson."
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,"Right... [beat] Hey, i-is that... you?"
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,spike,"Oh, yep, it sure is! Now, according to the list, Sunburst's house is<U+0097>"
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,Why is there a statue of you in the Crystal Empire?
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,Really?
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,"Um, when were you going to tell me about this?"
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,spike,"Nah, it's no big deal."
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,That's it! We're not going anywhere until I get the whole story!
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,shining armor,"Before we go in, I should probably tell you. Seeing the baby might be a bit of a shock."
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"Of course, I could be wrong."
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,The baby is an Alicorn?!
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,princess cadance,[tired] It looks that way.
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,rarity,"But... But... But I thought Alicorn wings had to be earned by accomplishing some great, princess-worthy deed!"
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,applejack,Yeah. How can you just be born with 'em?
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,princess celestia,The birth of an Alicorn is something Equestria has never seen!
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,princess luna,It is beyond even our understanding.
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,fluttershy,[hushed] That's not very reassuring.
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,pinkie pie,"Wow! A unicorn, and a Pegasus! So she could be a super-strong flyer and have crazy baby magic!"
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,rainbow dash,"Well, I know all about super-strong flying!"
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,And I can help keep tabs on her magic!
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,princess celestia,It appears her magic is more powerful than that of a newborn unicorn!
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,princess luna,The crowds have already started to gather.
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,pinkie pie,[inhales] [blows balloon] This Crystalling is gonna be some party!
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,princess cadance,Do you think we should call it off?
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,rainbow dash,"Um, we've all faced a lot worse than baby magic."
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,rarity,I can't imagine cancelling such a beautiful and important ceremony over something so potentially adorable!
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,princess celestia,"In light of the little one's abilities, this Crystalling might be more important than ever. [to Cadance] Perhaps you should address your subjects and remind them of that."
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,Shining Armor! Do you have everything you need for the ceremony?
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,shining armor,"[tired] Huh? Oh, no! I still have to interview the honor guards, choose the purity crystal, and pick a crystaller!"
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"Alright, take it easy. Pinkie can stay here with me and keep an eye on the baby."
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,applejack,And we'll all help you with everythin' else.
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,shining armor,[snores] ...baby...
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,rarity,"That is, if you can stay awake long enough to tell us how."
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,spike,"...and that's how we found the Crystal Heart, defeated King Sombra, and saved the Empire."
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,spike,"Well, as much as I love reliving my heroic deeds, Starlight and I have an important lesson to do, by order of the Princess of Friendship!"
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,"Aw, come on, Spike! I want to hear about the Games too!"
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,spike,"I know you're nervous about seeing Sunburst, but it says right in step 3, to, uh, ""Deal with your fears by facing them, not by putting it off."""
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,Ugh. Let's go get this over with.
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,spike,Wait!
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,Huh? What?!
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,spike,Knocking on the door isn't the next thing on the list!
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,Seriously?
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,spike,"I know Twilight can be a little nitpicky, but this is your first lesson as her pupil, and it's important that we do it right!"
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,Fine. What's the next thing on the list?
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,spike,"[clears throat] [reading] ""Before they see each other, be sure to highlight the importance of the meeting."""
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,I'm pretty sure we can skip that.
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,spike,"I don't know... I mean if we skip it, the whole lesson could go south! And then you might end up taking a giant step backwards instead of forwards! Maybe you'll never be able to learn anything about friendship at all! It's almost like your whole future depends on this moment. [beat] ""Highlight the importance of the meeting"" <U+0096> check! I can't believe you wanted to skip that!"
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,Sunburst?
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,sunburst,Yes? What can I do for you?
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,"It's... It's me, Starlight. We used to be friends?"
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,sunburst,"[beat] Oh, of course! S-Starlight! My goodness, it-it's been a long time! What, uh, what have you been up to?"
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,"Me? Oh! You know, some of this, some of that, different... stuff. Right now, I'm sort of Twilight Sparkle's new pupil."
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,sunburst,The Princess of Friendship?
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,"Heh... yeah... that's actually kind of why I'm here. I mean, I know you're probably very busy."
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,sunburst,What do you mean?
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,"Well, I figured after magic school, you'd go on to do important wizard work, but..."
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,sunburst,"Oh. No. Y-Yes! Uh, y-yes, that's me, yup. [nervous chuckle] Important wizard! Really busy with lots of, uh, wi-wizarding... stuff. [beat] Right. Uh, well... good to see you."
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,spike,Huh. Maybe we should have skipped highlighting the importance of the meeting after all.
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,"Well, I guess that's that!"
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,spike,"Starlight, come on! We have to at least explain what Twilight wants!"
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,princess cadance,"[tired, amplified] Dearest citizens, I am sure you are all just as thrilled and ready for this Crystalling as myself and Shining Armor."
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,shining armor,[panicked breathing] I'm not ready!
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,rainbow dash,Take it easy! Just pick whoever looks the most like honor guard material.
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,shining armor,Right... right.
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,shining armor,I'm sorry. Fatherhood is way more stressful than I ever thought.
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,fluttershy,I can only imagine.
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,rarity,"Now, I know choosing the crystal of purity is a very important decision. So I have gone through the trouble of arranging them in order from incredibly pure to outrageously pure."
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,fluttershy,"Um, Rarity, don't they all sort of look the same?"
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,rarity,"Oh, well, to the untrained eye, perhaps. What do you think, Shining Armor?"
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,shining armor,[incoherent stammering] I don't know!
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,rarity,[hushed] I hope Twilight and Pinkie are having better luck with the baby!
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,pinkie pie,Well... at least she's having... fun!
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,pinkie pie,Whee!
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"Pinkie, hold her still!"
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,pinkie pie,I'm tryiiiiiiing!
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,sunburst,So... the Princess of Friendship wants you and I to be friends again?
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,"Heh, I know. Weird, right?"
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,sunburst,"Uh, I don't understand. Did something happen to you after I left for magic school?"
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,What?
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,No! I-I don't see what that has to do with anything. W-Why would you even ask that?
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,"I mean, did something happen to you after you left for magic school?"
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,sunburst,"What? Um, no. L-Like you said, I'm a, [clears throat] i-important wizard."
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,spike,I'm sure there's something on Twilight's list that can help here.
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,shining armor,"Okay. I chose the honor guard, picked the purity crystal, and I know exactly who I want to be our crystaller. So, all we need is..."
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,princess cadance,The baby?
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,We're here!
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,pinkie pie,She's a really strong flyer!
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,applejack,I'm guessin' that's gonna make it harder to do the Crystalling.
The Crystalling - Part 1,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"It's worse than that. Without the Heart, the Crystal Empire's about to be buried under a mountain of ice and snow!"
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,I still can't believe you're letting me stay here... as your pupil.
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,Shining Armor's a father! I'm an aunt!
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,Your first friendship lesson is going to be... reuniting with Sunburst!
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,sunburst,"Uh, y-yes, that's me, yup. [nervous chuckle] Important wizard!"
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,The baby is an Alicorn?!
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,pinkie pie,So she could be a super-strong flyer and have crazy baby magic!
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"Without the Heart, the Crystal Empire's about to be buried under a mountain of ice and snow!"
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,rarity,"So... not only can we not take part in a fabulous ancient ceremony, but we're also about to be frozen solid!"
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"Without the Crystal Heart's magical protection, the entire city's about to become a winter wasteland!"
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,applejack,But what about when King Sombra ruled the Crystal Empire and the Crystal Heart was missin'? The city wasn't covered in snow then!
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,The Heart wasn't missing. It was still in the castle. King Sombra had just hidden it.
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,princess celestia,"I'm afraid Twilight is correct, and the storm clouds are already forming."
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,rainbow dash,I can totally fly up there and bust those puppies! No problem!
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,princess celestia,"I wouldn't advise it, Rainbow Dash. Those storm clouds are not like the ones you know."
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,princess luna,"This far north, the weather has a will of its own, and now it will only grow stronger, enveloping everything in its path."
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,princess cadance,Including the Crystal Empire!
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,And us along with it!
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,spike,There's gotta be somethin'...
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,sunburst,"I know Princess Twilight is keen on the two of us rekindling our friendship, but... it's been so long. I don't see how anything on that list is going to help."
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,"I know, right? It's not like there's some spell that would magically compel us to pick up where we left off."
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,sunburst,"Well, actually, there's several. Mistmane's Material Amity, Rockhoof's Rapport, Flash Prance's Fellow... ship... [ahem] But I-I get the feeling the princess isn't looking for a spell."
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,[chuckle] Definitely not.
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,spike,"Got it! [reading] ""And if all else fails, ask them to share an embarrassing moment from their past, maybe even something they regret!"""
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,sunburst,"Uh, I don't see how that would help."
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,"Uh, yeah! We should just get out of your mane. It's pretty obvious this isn't going how Twilight hoped, and I'm sure you have plenty of important work to do..."
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,sunburst,"What? Oh! Right, yes, heh-heh! Uh, no rest for the wizardly."
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,"Come on, Spike."
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,There must be a spell that can restore the Crystal Heart!
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,princess celestia,Perhaps.
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,princess luna,But it isn't something that either of us know.
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,princess cadance,The library here at the castle is nearly as extensive as the one in Canterlot. There's a good chance we can find something there!
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,Can you hold off the storm?
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,princess luna,"Yes, for a time, but even our magic will eventually succumb to the power of the Frozen North."
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,princess celestia,"We will do what we can, but you must hurry."
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"I don't know how long it will take to find the right spell, but you should probably tell the crowd outside to get somewhere warm!"
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,princess cadance,And try not to mention the Crystal Heart. We don't want to start a panic.
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,applejack,"Yes, ma'am. C'mon, girls!"
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,I'm gonna need all of your help. The crystal library is enormous!
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,shining armor,"You can count on us, Twily!"
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,shining armor,Where'd she go?!
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,princess cadance,This way!
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,"Well, Spike, looks like my biggest fears came true. I wouldn't be surprised if Twilight decides to give up on me entirely."
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,"It's not the list, Spike. Or you. Or Twilight. I'm the one Sunburst doesn't want to be friends with."
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,spike,I don't remember him saying he didn't want to be friends.
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,He didn't have to say it.
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,spike,"Well, Twilight obviously thinks you're worth being friends with! And I do too!"
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,"Thanks, Spike. At least I have two friends, even if one of them has dragon breath."
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,spike,"[exhales] Uh, that's not dragon breath. It's freezing!"
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,"Oh, you're right! But I thought the Crystal Heart was supposed to keep the cold weather out."
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,spike,It is... unless something's happened! Come on!
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,rainbow dash,We're just saying that it might not be the best idea to stay outside!
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,fluttershy,"Still, when you think about it, the view is just as good a little further back, like... inside your house?"
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,applejack,"Honestly, I don't know if there's gonna be a Crystallin'. The truth is, the baby's an Alicorn and her magic's plum crazy, so you might not wanna be that close after all."
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,rainbow dash,"Look, I am a hundred percent sure the Crystalling isn't happening."
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,shining armor,Young filly... come back here!
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,pinkie pie,Come to your Auntie Pinkie Pie!
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"Bridle Buck's Boat Chants, Hayhoof's Intonements, Mystic Maps and Mazes... [groans] Anything up there?"
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,princess cadance,Not yet! I'm not even sure how these are organized!
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,princess cadance,"Shining Armor, I thought you were taking care of the baby!"
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,shining armor,I'm trying!
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,rarity,Gotcha!
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,rarity,Oh! Or not...
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,pinkie pie,Whoa!
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,What is going on?!
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,pinkie pie,You want the long or the short version?
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,Short?
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,pinkie pie,"[quickly] The baby's an Alicorn and she accidentally destroyed the Crystal Heart, so Twilight and Cadance are looking for a spell to put it back together and save the Crystal Empire from turning into a giant wasteland of ice and snow."
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,Oh.
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,princess cadance,[gasps] What about this? Trotter's Tome of Reliquary?
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,I think this is it!
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,princess cadance,"[reading] ""Spell of Relic Reconstitution""! I can't believe we found it!"
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"It's a good thing, too! Without this, I don't know what we'd do!"
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,pinkie pie,Oops.
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,That spell was the only thing we found in the whole library that was even close to what we needed!
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,"I'm so sorry, Twilight!"
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"It's not your fault, Starlight. None of us were expecting any of this."
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,princess cadance,Do you think you can remember the spell?
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,I only read it through once!
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,rarity,"Well, if anypony can exactly remember something she read for the first time two minutes ago, it's you, Twilight."
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,I'll try. But I'm not sure how long it'll take.
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,pinkie pie,Is quickly an option?
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,princess cadance,"I'll help if I can, but we should evacuate the city just in case! You need to lead everypony to the train station before the tracks freeze over!"
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,shining armor,"We will. But between you and Twilight, I'm sure you'll remember the spell."
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,I only hope this spell is the one we need.
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,Is there anything I can do?
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,I don't think so. I'm just sorry about your lesson.
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,"Oh, that doesn't matter now. Sunburst and I don't have anything in common anyway. He's a big important wizard! And I'm re-learning everything I ever thought I knew."
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,princess cadance,"Sunburst? I don't recognize the name, but if he's an important wizard, you should bring him here. Maybe he'll know what to do if the spell fails."
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,[gasps] Of course!
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"You better go with her, Spike."
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,[straining] Sunburst! Haven't you looked outside?!
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,sunburst,Snow? That's... not right. The Crystal Heart<U+0097>
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,Is gone! The baby <U+0096> Shining Armor and Cadance's baby <U+0096> it's an Alicorn!
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,sunburst,Really?
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,"Really! And her magic is a little berserk, and well, I guess she destroyed the Heart! But Twilight thinks she can fix it and Princess Cadance thought you could help!"
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,sunburst,Me?
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,Of course! You're an important wizard in the Crystal Empire! It just makes sense!
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,sunburst,"Right... right... right right right. You know, I'd like to help, I-I really would. I-I just have so much, um, important wizard work to do around here."
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,applejack,You can't stay here!
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,fluttershy,I really don't think it's going to happen.
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,rainbow dash,"Come on, it's freezing out here!"
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,shining armor,Not like this! We don't have time to argue! Princess Cadance has decided to evacuate the city!
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,shining armor,I don't know if we'll ever have another Crystalling again! The Crystal Heart... is shattered.
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,applejack,[groan] That's what we've been tryin' to tell you!
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,"Sunburst, I know you're busy, but did you hear what I said?"
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,sunburst,"Oh, I heard you, but-but like I said, when you're an important wizard, the work just piles up."
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,Sunburst!
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,sunburst,"[sighs] Look, Starlight, I want to help. I do. But I can't. I wish I could."
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,What do you mean?!
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,sunburst,Fixing an ancient relic? I-I can't even come close to doing something like that!
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,But I thought you were an important wizard!
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,sunburst,"Well, you were wrong, okay?! I'm not an important wizard! I'm not even a wizard at all!"
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,sunburst,"I know it's hard for you to understand, but not all of us end up achieving greatness."
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,What? Why wouldn't I understand that?
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,sunburst,Really? You're the prot<e9>g<e9> of the Princess of Friendship! I don't think she picks just anypony for that!
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,spike,"Technically, she's more of a student than a prot<e9>g<e9>."
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,sunburst,Whatever. I'm sorry I'm not the big important wizard you were expecting.
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,"Sunburst, I don't care if you're a wizard or not. I'm just surprised. You always knew so much about magic. I mean, look at all these books!"
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,sunburst,"Yeah, well, reading about magic is one thing, but you don't know what it was like at magic school! To know so much and not be able to do any of it!"
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,"Well, you don't know what it was like to be left behind! And then getting so bitter that you steal the cutie marks from an entire village and then get defeated by Twilight and her friends, so you travel through time to get back at them, but they beat you again and teach you about friendship, but you're so terrified ponies will find out what you did that you can't make any friends!"
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,sunburst,Did you really travel through time?
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,spike,See? I told you he'd be impressed.
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,sunburst,"I'm sorry we lost touch. Maybe if I had reached out, you could have helped me at magic school, and I could have helped you to..."
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,Not become totally evil? [sighs] Let's just say I know what it's like to have something you're not exactly proud of.
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,sunburst,When you showed up thinking I was some big wizard... I'm sorry. I should have told you the truth.
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,It's fine. At least we worked it all out. I think Twilight would be proud of us.
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,spike,"Well, if you ever want to tell her about it, we should probably leave now!"
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,"[gasps] I forgot to tell you! They're evacuating the city! You need to get to the train station, unless you've got a spell here that will drive back the Frozen North and fix the Crystal Heart so the baby can have her Crystalling?"
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,sunburst,Crystalling...! Of course!
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,princess celestia,"Push them back, my sister!"
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,shining armor,This way!
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,rainbow dash,Ugh!
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,applejack,"Just a little bit further, y'all! The station's just ahead!"
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,We have to go back!
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,sunburst,I know how to stop this!
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"Uh, I think that's everything?"
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,princess cadance,"It looks right to me, but... there's only one way to find out!"
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,The spell failed. I don't know what else to do.
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,princess celestia,An old student of mine believes he does.
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,sunburst,The baby did this?!
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,I tried putting it back together with<U+0097>
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,sunburst,"The spell of Relic Reconstitution. No, that won't do it. The Crystal Heart's been around for millennia. Restoring a relic like this is way beyond one spell. You need to combine it with something else. Something unique to the relic itself. Something that strengthens it and provides it with power...?"
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,The Crystalling!
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,sunburst,"Combining that spell with the light and love of everypony gathered for the ceremony, together with... Somnambula's Weather Abjuration to clear away the snow... and a little Fledgling's Forbearance for the parents... Heh. That should curb the little one's power fluctuations."
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,princess cadance,You must be Sunburst. Starlight said you were a powerful wizard.
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,sunburst,"Oh, I'm no wizard."
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,rainbow dash,What?
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,"But he studied magic his whole life! You should see his house! And since nopony has any better ideas, what do we have to lose?!"
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,shining armor,"I had planned on asking Twilight to be our crystaller, but since it seems like she'll be busy..."
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,sunburst,I'd be honored!
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"Well, what are we waiting for?!"
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,sunburst,Citizens! May I present the newest member of the Crystal Empire!
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,"For a pony who isn't great at magic, you did pretty well."
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,princess celestia,"Indeed. I'm glad to see you've found a way to share your unique gift, Sunburst. You may be more of a wizard than you think."
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,applejack,"Yeah, peaceful now, anyway."
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,I suppose that spell really did the trick!
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,shining armor,We have Sunburst to thank for that.
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,princess cadance,I hope he takes his role as crystaller seriously. Something tells me the baby will need a pony like him to look to for magical advice.
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,princess cadance,"We were thinking... ""Flurry Heart""."
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,shining armor,"You know, to remember the occasion."
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,rarity,"Oh, goodness, how could anypony forget?"
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,"Well, I think you're the Crystal Empire's big important wizard, whether you like it or not."
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,sunburst,I don't know if I'll have time for any wizarding. I'm a crystaller now. That's a big responsibility.
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,I can't think of anypony more qualified. Just... promise you'll stay in touch?
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,sunburst,"Hm, like I'd ever lose touch with my oldest friend."
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,spike,"What's wrong, Twilight?"
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"I don't know, Spike. I think I have a lot to learn about being a teacher."
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,spike,What are you talking about? Your lesson went perfectly! Starlight and Sunburst got over their past and rekindled their friendship!
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,No thanks to me. I know a lot happened. I just wish I could have given my pupil the attention she deserves.
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,spike,"Well, I know she needed to be put on the right path, but giving her the space to make her own decisions worked pretty well. Isn't that how Celestia taught you?"
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"You know, I never thought about it! But I guess it is!"
The Crystalling - Part 2,Josh Haber,spike,Maybe you're a better teacher than you thought.

On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,apple bloom,"Look, I know our cutie marks are amazing, but is that all we're gonna do now? Just spend our days starin' down at our own flanks?"
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,[sighs] I guess not.
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,scootaloo,"Yeah, I suppose that could get real boring..."
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,apple bloom,[wistfully] Yeah... [beat] This is ridiculous! We need to go out and do somethin'!
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,"Wow, you're right!"
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,scootaloo,"Yeah, we need to go try new stuff like we used to!"
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,apple bloom,Exactly.
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,Like square dancing!
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,cutie mark crusaders,Yeah!
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,apple bloom,"And the more things we try, the more chances we'll have to finally get our cutie marks! Come on!"
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,Um... Apple Bloom?
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,apple bloom,Wow... Did we really only ever do things just to get our cutie marks?
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,I don't know. Maybe?
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,scootaloo,"Aw, come on! We did lots of stuff that didn't have anything to do with getting a cutie mark."
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,Of course we did!
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,apple bloom,Absolutely!
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,"Huh. So now that we don't have to do stuff to get our cutie marks, what is it that the Cutie Mark Crusaders actually do?"
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,apple bloom,We do exactly what we got our cutie marks in!
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,cutie mark crusaders,Helping other ponies!
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,scootaloo,Ponies without cutie marks!
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,Or ponies who've forgotten their special purpose!
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,apple bloom,Exactly! We just have to find ponies who need our help! Come on!
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,But are you sure you feel content?
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,big mcintosh,Eeyup.
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,scootaloo,Not even a tinge of dissatisfaction?
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,big mcintosh,Nnnope.
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,apple bloom,Not even the slightest naggin' sensation that you don't really know what your purpose is in life or why you have a big apple as a cutie mark?
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,big mcintosh,[grunts] [spits] [annoyed] Nnnope.
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,apple bloom,The important thing to remember is that there is no rush.
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,scootaloo,"The three of us tried for the longest time, but it just comes when it comes!"
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,And it's totally normal to feel confused and maybe even a little lost. But being a blank flank is nothing to be ashamed of.
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,scootaloo,So if you're having even the slightest problem...
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,...or concerns or questions...
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,apple bloom,...we want you to know that we are here to help.
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,mrs. cake,Mrs. I... don't think they're too worried about it yet.
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,apple bloom,This is gonna be a lot harder than I thought.
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,Who knew there were so few ponies worried about their cutie marks?
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,scootaloo,Kinda makes you wonder why we made such a big deal out of it for so long.
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,scootaloo,What?
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,apple bloom,"The point is, helpin' ponies with cutie mark problems is what makes us special."
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,But if we can't find anypony with a problem...
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,scootaloo,...Maybe we're not special.
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,bulk biceps,"Yeah! I know exactly what you mean. You can't find a cutie mark problem. I have a cutie mark problem. It's so confusing, and I feel like the solution is staring me right in the muzzle."
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,bulk biceps,What?
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,bulk biceps,I see why you guys hang out here! It's cozy!
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,scootaloo,"[straining] The Crusader Clubhouse is a safe place, Mr... um... Bulk."
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,A place where we faced all kinds of cutie mark problems!
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,apple bloom,A place where we'll go on to solve even more! Startin' with yours!
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,scootaloo,No matter how long it takes!
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,Or how hard it is!
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,apple bloom,We'll solve it because that's what we do!
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,bulk biceps,Yeah!
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,So... what's your cutie mark problem?
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,bulk biceps,"Oh, right. Uh, well, my cutie mark is a dumbbell, but I've lifted every dumbbell in Ponyville!"
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,scootaloo,[nervously] Have you tried lifting other things?
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,bulk biceps,"You mean, not dumbbells?"
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,Yeah!
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,apple bloom,Yeah!
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,bulk biceps,Yeah!
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,bulk biceps,Oof! I mean... no. I hadn't thought of that. You guys are awesome!
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,bulk biceps,But... what happens when I run out of other stuff?
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,...I guess you could teach other ponies to lift things?
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,apple bloom,Yeah!
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,scootaloo,Yeah!
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,bulk biceps,"Yeah! Wow, you three really have a knack for this!"
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,That was easy!
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,apple bloom,Maybe too easy.
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,scootaloo,What do you mean?
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,apple bloom,"Well, it's lookin' like cutie mark problems are few and far between."
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,And...?
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,apple bloom,And what if we never find another one?
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,scootaloo,Well...
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,apple bloom,"And even if we do, we could solve it so quick, it'll be like it never happened in the first place!"
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,So...?
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,apple bloom,So... then the Cutie Mark Crusaders don't have any reason to exist!
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,The problem boils down to this <U+0096> we don't need to go out and do things anymore to get our cutie marks.
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,apple bloom,Right! And<U+0097>
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,scootaloo,Ponies with cutie mark problems are hard to find.
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,apple bloom,"Exactly. But even when we find problems, we're so good at solvin' them that most of the time there's nothin' for the Cutie Mark Crusaders to do. So..."
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,apple bloom,I thought we should start figurin' out ways to search all of Equestria for cutie mark problems!
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,scootaloo,That kinda seems like a lot.
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,I don't think Rarity would let me travel to the far reaches of Equestria looking for cutie mark problems.
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,scootaloo,"Yeah, I'm sure we'll come across them in Ponyville. And when we do, we'll totally solve them because we are so awesome at it!"
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,apple bloom,But... what do we do until then?
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,Maybe whatever we want?
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,apple bloom,What do you mean?
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,"Well, we used to only do stuff to get our cutie marks or fulfill our destiny, but now we don't have to."
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,apple bloom,So... we can do things just for fun? Are you girls thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?!
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,scootaloo,"Just remember <U+0096> stomp, kick, and roll! After this, you two are gonna love scootering as much as me!"
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,apple bloom,If you say so.
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,scootaloo,"Ready? Stomp, kick, and roll! Whooo!"
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,scootaloo,Ta-da!
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,apple bloom,[nervous laugh] I don't think I did it right.
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,[blows pitch pipe] Do... Mi... So... It's just a simple harmony.
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,scootaloo,"Harmony, huh?"
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,"[tapping with baton] And a-one, and a-two, and a-one two three!"
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,scootaloo,"Wow, that was simple!"
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,apple bloom,"It's just a dash, and a drop, and a drip!"
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,apple bloom,"Just a dash, and a drop, and a drip!"
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,apple bloom,...and even though Scootaloo thinks bungee jumping is the bee's knees...
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,apple bloom,...Sweetie Belle would rather keep bees.
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,apple bloom,"[spits] Of course, I'm allergic. Who'd've thought it'd be so hard to find somethin' for us all to do together?"
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,scootaloo,"Well, I know this might sound crazy, but what if we didn't?"
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,apple bloom,Didn't what?
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,scootaloo,"Do things together. Well, do everything together."
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,apple bloom,But we're the Cutie Mark Crusaders!
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,scootaloo,"And we always will be! But I really wanna bungee jump! The speed, the height, the fall!"
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,"And I know you two aren't interested, but I wanna try crochet."
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,scootaloo,Isn't there something you've always wanted to do on your own?
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,apple bloom,I don't know... I guess I figured we'd always do stuff together. But bungee jumping sounds just as scary as crochet sounds borin'.
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,scootaloo,"That's okay. Sweetie Belle and I can do the things we like, and you can do whatever you like!"
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,Just as soon as you figure out what it is.
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,apple bloom,I guess...
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,scootaloo,Great! Then we can meet back here and talk all about what we've done!
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,apple bloom,But I don't know what it'll be.
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,You'll find something!
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,scootaloo,Something awesome!
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,apple bloom,[sighs] Well... I guess now I have to.
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,apple bloom,I never imagined myself out on my own Tryin' to find out what's next for me The Cutie Mark Crusaders have always been my home Maybe now there's more that I could be
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,apple bloom,"Whatever kind of dancin' y'all are doin', you're doin' it together, and I want in! [beat] I-I mean, uh, [clears throat] Would it be okay if I enrolled in this dance class?"
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,apple bloom,That sounds an awful lot like friendship! And I'm ready for anything I don't have to do by myself!
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,apple bloom,Whooooooa!
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,apple bloom,"Whoa, whoaaa!"
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,apple bloom,"Whew! I feel like that went pretty good, but let's give it one more whirl, because it's important that I do a good job partnering with my new group of friends."
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,apple bloom,"I'm sorry, but doin' stuff on my own is exactly what I don't want."
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,apple bloom,"Tryin' different things with my friends is always fun, even when we were terrible. Now it's just terrible."
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,apple bloom,"[sighs] Thanks, but... without my friends, I don't think I'll ever feel again. Good luck at the recital."
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,apple bloom,"[deadpan] Yeah, okay. Nice meetin' you."
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,scootaloo,"Sweetie Belle! You are not gonna believe this, but I think I like bungee jumping even more than scootering!"
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,Seriously?! That's amazing! Look what I did!
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,scootaloo,"Wow, uh, that's, um..."
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,"Horrible! But it was so much fun! Rarity showed me how, even though she says [imitating Rarity] ""Crochet is knitting's poorer cousin"", [normal] but I loved it!"
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,scootaloo,Awesome!
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,apple bloom,"Oh, hello, girls. Have fun pursuing your own interests?"
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,scootaloo,Apple Bloom? What are you doing sitting in the dark?
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,"Yeah, we thought you'd be out looking for things you like to do."
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,apple bloom,[laughs] I did. I looked all over town. I looked... and I looked... and I looked... and you know what I found? Nothin'!
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,scootaloo,You tried every one of these?
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,apple bloom,And each one just made me feel more alone than the next! I don't see how I'm supposed to be happy that we're not hanging out anymore!
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,scootaloo,"Wait, I never said that. I just said we don't have to do everything together."
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,Like when there's something one of us wants to do that the others don't.
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,apple bloom,"Oh. [beat] Well, I guess that changes things."
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,scootaloo,I can't believe you thought we didn't want to hang out anymore.
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,I can't believe you tried all this stuff and didn't find one thing you liked!
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,apple bloom,"Well, I kind of liked dancin', mainly because it looked like somethin' you couldn't do alone, but... I wasn't very good at it."
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,"Well, you don't have to be good at something to have fun!"
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,scootaloo,And being good doesn't always mean you will.
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,apple bloom,"I know... I met the best dancer in the world, but he was so shy, he couldn't bring himself to perform, even though he really, really wanted to."
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,"I don't suppose this dancing pony had a cutie mark, did he?"
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,apple bloom,You're here!
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,apple bloom,"You told me that you wanted to perform more than anythin', but I was too caught up in myself to listen. You're the best dancer I've ever seen, and I'm here to convince you to get out on that stage!"
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,apple bloom,"We can go on together! No matter what, you'll look good dancin' next to me."
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,apple bloom,Leave everything to us.
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,"Don't worry, you'll be just fine!"
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,apple bloom,Here goes nothin'...
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,apple bloom,Can't be any worse than I was!
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,scootaloo,No problem!
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,It's what we do.
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,apple bloom,I only wish I'd realized what you needed right away instead of mopin' around for no reason...
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,apple bloom,"[taps] You know, I just might! It sure is a lot of fun, and I'm pretty confident I can only get better. [to the Crusaders] I'm sorry I was so silly about us all doin' our own things. If we hadn't, I might never even have tried dancin'!"
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,"With each of us going out and trying things on our own, we'll be three times as likely to find ponies to help!"
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,scootaloo,"And trying new stuff might even make us better at helping them, like how I used my bungee jumping to change the sets!"
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,sweetie belle,Or my crochet to make the costumes!
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,apple bloom,"Well, one thing is for sure. The Cutie Mark Crusaders will never be the same. We'll be better!"
On Your Marks,Dave Polsky & Josh Haber; story by Dave Polsky,cutie mark crusaders,Yeah!
Gauntlet of Fire,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,rarity,"[hushed] The last time I was here, I woke them and ended up with a mane full of bats! [sighs] Thanks for being my basket holder, Spike."
Gauntlet of Fire,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,spike,Basket holder? I thought I was your bodyguard.
Gauntlet of Fire,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,rarity,"[hushed] What? Oh, heh, yes, yes, that of course, too. Oh, for once I wish unicorn magic wasn't so... luminescent!"
Gauntlet of Fire,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,rarity,[hushed] Spike! You'll wake the bats! Turn that off!
Gauntlet of Fire,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,I'm so glad you two could come!
Gauntlet of Fire,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,princess luna,Of course. We so rarely get a chance to relax and just visit.
Gauntlet of Fire,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,princess celestia,There's usually some crisis we have to deal with. Somepony always needs our help. But today<U+0097>
Gauntlet of Fire,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,rarity,"[muffled, wailing] Help!"
Gauntlet of Fire,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,rarity,Twilight! There's something wrong with Spike!
Gauntlet of Fire,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,What's wrong?
Gauntlet of Fire,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,spike,"[grunts] I don't know! Nngh! All of a sudden, my scales just started glowing and... burning!"
Gauntlet of Fire,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,princess luna,"Little is known about dragon culture, but this is a phenomenon we've seen before. It is the call of the Dragon Lord."
Gauntlet of Fire,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,princess celestia,Dragons glow whenever the Dragon Lord has need of them in the Dragon Lands.
Gauntlet of Fire,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,spike,Great... H-How do I make it stop?!
Gauntlet of Fire,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,princess luna,The only way to end the summons is to answer it. You must journey to the Dragon Lands and see what is expected of you.
Gauntlet of Fire,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,rarity,"B-B-But the Dragon Lands are full of... dragons! And they're ghastly creatures! [beat] Oh, oh, not you, of course, Spikey-wikey. But remember that rotten Garble?"
Gauntlet of Fire,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,spike,"[gulps] How could I forget? He would have burnt us to a crisp if you weren't there. If I have to go to the Dragon Lands, would you two come with me?"
Gauntlet of Fire,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,"Ooh! Oh my goodness, I'd love to! We are sadly lacking any information on dragon culture and customs. I could research them <U+0096> maybe even write an article! This could be my chance to make a great contribution to the knowledge of Equestria! [beat] And be there for Spike, heh, of course."
Gauntlet of Fire,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,princess celestia,Be very careful. The Dragon Lands are particularly dangerous for ponies. It would be wise to be discreet.
Gauntlet of Fire,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,I think we might want something a little more practical this time.
Gauntlet of Fire,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,rarity,"Hmmm... Well, it may be practical, but this disguise isn't flattering in the slightest!"
Gauntlet of Fire,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,[hushed] It's not supposed to be flattering. It's supposed to blend in!
Gauntlet of Fire,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,spike,Shh!
Gauntlet of Fire,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,garble,"Hey-hey, look! It's our old friend Sparkle-warkle."
Gauntlet of Fire,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,spike,It's Spike.
Gauntlet of Fire,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,garble,Are you sure your pony friends didn't give you a pony name?
Gauntlet of Fire,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,spike,"It's nice to see you too, Garble."
Gauntlet of Fire,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,garble,I didn't say it was nice to see you. It's not. I don't like you. Was I not clear about that?
Gauntlet of Fire,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,spike,Hey! That's my rock!
Gauntlet of Fire,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,garble,"Oh, really? Then why aren't you sitting on it?"
Gauntlet of Fire,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,spike,Who is that?
Gauntlet of Fire,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,garble,"It's Dragon Lord Torch, dummy."
Gauntlet of Fire,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,spike,"No, next to him."
Gauntlet of Fire,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,garble,"That's his daughter, Princess Ember. I wouldn't even look at her if I were you, unless you want Torch to eat you!"
Gauntlet of Fire,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,"[hushed] This is fascinating! Dragons are notoriously reckless, but they do whatever the Dragon Lord says!"
Gauntlet of Fire,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,"[hushed] When the scepter disappeared, the dragons stopped glowing! We are learning so much!"
Gauntlet of Fire,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,spike,"Uh, excuse me!"
Gauntlet of Fire,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,garble,"Ugh, you even sneeze like a pony!"
Gauntlet of Fire,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,spike,"I don't want to be Dragon Lord or dragon toast, and I stopped glowing, so let's sneak out of here!"
Gauntlet of Fire,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,spike,"Oh, uh, hi, your Lordship. Uh, I was just going home!"
Gauntlet of Fire,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,princess ember,"Dad, look at him. He's just a runt. Besides, he doesn't even wanna compete. Let him go."
Gauntlet of Fire,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,spike,"Of course, your Lordship! I, uh, guess I don't understand dragon customs. Another reason why I shouldn't compete."
Gauntlet of Fire,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,spike,Thank you! [to Ember] And thank you.
Gauntlet of Fire,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,princess ember,To prepare for the Gauntlet.
Gauntlet of Fire,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,princess ember,But I'm smarter than most of these boulderheads and you know it!
Gauntlet of Fire,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,princess ember,[growls] I hate when he does that!
Gauntlet of Fire,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,garble,"That's nothing! When I'm in charge, the first thing I'll do is get revenge on those puny ponies! They'll regret they ever crossed Garble! We'll take whatever we want from Equestria and burn the rest!"
Gauntlet of Fire,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,"[hushed] Oh, my gosh!"
Gauntlet of Fire,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,rarity,"[hushed] Ooh, I can't believe I'm saying this, but I hope that burping dragon wins!"
Gauntlet of Fire,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,spike,None of them can win! Equestria's in big trouble if any of them are in charge!
Gauntlet of Fire,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,But what can we do?
Gauntlet of Fire,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,spike,"There's only one thing to do, and only I can do it! I have to win the Gauntlet of Fire!"
Gauntlet of Fire,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,rarity,What do you mean you have to win the Gauntlet?
Gauntlet of Fire,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,spike,"It's the only way to protect Equestria from the dragons. You heard them! They have horrible plans for ponies if they win! So somehow, I have to do it!"
Gauntlet of Fire,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,"There has to be another way. It's too dangerous. Besides, if you win, you'd have to stay here!"
Gauntlet of Fire,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,spike,"I know, but there's no other way to keep my friends safe."
Gauntlet of Fire,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,"Well, if you're staying to compete, then we're staying to cheer you on!"
Gauntlet of Fire,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,spike,"I decided to compete. I am a dragon, after all."
Gauntlet of Fire,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,garble,Are you sure? You can't even fly!
Gauntlet of Fire,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,garble,Good luck! Just kidding. I hope you lose.
Gauntlet of Fire,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,spike,"[gasps] [sarcastically] Thanks, Garble! I was planning on swimming anyway!"
Gauntlet of Fire,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,rarity,"You can do it, Spike!"
Gauntlet of Fire,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,spike,He's gonna drown!
Gauntlet of Fire,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,Spike!
Gauntlet of Fire,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,spike,"Hey, are you okay?"
Gauntlet of Fire,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,spike,[gasps] Princess Ember!
Gauntlet of Fire,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,princess ember,What do you think you're doing?
Gauntlet of Fire,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,rarity,Only saving your ungrateful scales!
Gauntlet of Fire,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,princess ember,Did that seaweed just talk? Ponies?! What are they doing here?!
Gauntlet of Fire,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,spike,They're my friends!
Gauntlet of Fire,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,princess ember,Friends? Dragons don't do friends.
Gauntlet of Fire,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,spike,"Well, this dragon does."
Gauntlet of Fire,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,princess ember,Whatever. I don't care as long as none of you get in my way. I have a Gauntlet to win.
Gauntlet of Fire,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,spike,But I thought your dad said that<U+0097>
Gauntlet of Fire,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,princess ember,I don't care what my dad said! I'll show him and every dragon who thinks I'm just a little princess there are better things than being big and strong!
Gauntlet of Fire,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,garble,"[scream] [grunts] Don't leave me here, Spike!"
Gauntlet of Fire,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,garble,Ha-ha! Knew you'd do it. Your pony friends made you soft.
Gauntlet of Fire,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,spike,Uh-huh. You're welcome.
Gauntlet of Fire,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,princess ember,"[gruff voice] Uh, that's just me. I, uh, robbed some ponies on my way over here."
Gauntlet of Fire,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,garble,"Huh, I like your style. Have I met you before? You kind of look like<U+0097>"
Gauntlet of Fire,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,spike,"My, uh, old neighbor! Uh, Sandy... Rockbeach!"
Gauntlet of Fire,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,garble,Stupid slingtails knocked me down! But I've wasted enough time making small talk. Get it? Ha-ha! Because you're too small to win this! I'm funny.
Gauntlet of Fire,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,princess ember,Why did you cover for me? You could've had one less competitor.
Gauntlet of Fire,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,spike,I could ask you the same thing. You could've told Garble about my friends.
Gauntlet of Fire,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,princess ember,Yikes... That looks rough. But that's what makes it a challenge.
Gauntlet of Fire,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,spike,"Are you kidding? Those boulders are huge! Hey, what if we worked together? You fly me up there, and I'll help look out for boulders, like a second set of eyes!"
Gauntlet of Fire,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,rarity,Pssst!
Gauntlet of Fire,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,rarity,[hushed] Spike! Are you sure it's a good idea to team up with Ember? You don't know her too well.
Gauntlet of Fire,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,spike,"I do know she could've told Garble about you, but she didn't. I think we can trust her."
Gauntlet of Fire,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,Her behavior does seem contradictory to everything I've noted about dragons so far.
Gauntlet of Fire,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,princess ember,"Hey, you, little fella! I've thought about it, and your plan makes sense. Let's do it."
Gauntlet of Fire,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,spike,Really? Great! It's a deal!
Gauntlet of Fire,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,princess ember,"Just so you know, this doesn't mean we're gonna pick flowers or exchange necklaces or whatever pony friends do."
Gauntlet of Fire,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,Good luck. We'll meet you at the top.
Gauntlet of Fire,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,spike,Pull up! There's one on your tail!
Gauntlet of Fire,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,spike,Go left!
Gauntlet of Fire,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,spike,So what do we do now?
Gauntlet of Fire,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,princess ember,I think we go through there.
Gauntlet of Fire,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,rarity,"[yelps] Oh, that looks scary! I mean, you can do it!"
Gauntlet of Fire,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,princess ember,"Listen, Spike. I wouldn't have made it this far without you. So I guess, if you want to, we could keep working together. I mean, just until we get through that tunnel."
Gauntlet of Fire,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,spike,Okay!
Gauntlet of Fire,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,[hushed] We'll be right behind you!
Gauntlet of Fire,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,spike,[gasps] Oof!
Gauntlet of Fire,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,garble,Urgh!
Gauntlet of Fire,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,rarity,"Oh, you made it! Oh, we were so worried!"
Gauntlet of Fire,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,princess ember,Wait. How did you two get through?
Gauntlet of Fire,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,spike,Rarity!
Gauntlet of Fire,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,rarity,"[yelps] [panting] Oh, thanks, Spike!"
Gauntlet of Fire,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,spike,[sighs] It was nothing.
Gauntlet of Fire,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,princess ember,Nothing? You just risked everything to save her! And they're putting themselves in danger just to support you!
Gauntlet of Fire,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,spike,"Well, that's just what friends do. Don't you have anyone who looks out for you?"
Gauntlet of Fire,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,princess ember,"Not really. Unless I count you. [beat] Which I don't! Because we were only helping each other get through the tunnel, and now we're through the tunnel, so that's it."
Gauntlet of Fire,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,spike,"Wait, what do you mean?"
Gauntlet of Fire,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,princess ember,"Well, there's only one winner, one scepter, and one Dragon Lord. So I guess it's every dragon for themselves."
Gauntlet of Fire,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,spike,Oh. So we aren't really friends?
Gauntlet of Fire,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,princess ember,"Maybe if we were in Ponyland, but like I said, dragons don't do friendship."
Gauntlet of Fire,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,spike,I can't believe Ember ditched me.
Gauntlet of Fire,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,rarity,"[muffled] Oh, you're better off. She was only looking out for herself. She's just like all the other dragons."
Gauntlet of Fire,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,spike,"She's not, though. I know it. She saved me, even when she didn't have to. I don't care what she says. That makes us friends."
Gauntlet of Fire,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,"Is it just me, or have we seen this crevasse three times already?"
Gauntlet of Fire,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,spike,It's kinda hard to tell. They all look the same. Except for this one! Look! We made it! I can't believe I'm the only dragon to make it this far!
Gauntlet of Fire,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,garble,You're not! And I'm not losing to a puny pony-loving dragon like you!
Gauntlet of Fire,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,rarity,[yelps] [muffled] We have to do something!
Gauntlet of Fire,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,[muffled] Look!
Gauntlet of Fire,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,spike,[screaming] Ember! I thought it was every dragon for themselves! Why did you save me?!
Gauntlet of Fire,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,princess ember,"That's what friends do! And I am. I mean, we are. I never should have left you back there. Agh, please don't make me talk about my feelings!"
Gauntlet of Fire,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,garble,[straining] Argh! Whoa!
Gauntlet of Fire,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,garble,[frustrated grunt] I'm sick and tired of you two helping each other! Dragons don't do helping!
Gauntlet of Fire,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,spike,[panting] Whoa...
Gauntlet of Fire,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,spike,Leave her alone!
Gauntlet of Fire,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,garble,What? You?! You have the scepter?! But that means that you're...
Gauntlet of Fire,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,princess ember,The Dragon Lord. Dragon Lord Spike.
Gauntlet of Fire,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,garble,[groans] [reluctantly] Dragon... Lord... Spike...
Gauntlet of Fire,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,spike,"That's right! Uh... Now, go start your long journey home. And give every dragon you see on the way a hug. Don't tell them why."
Gauntlet of Fire,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,garble,Awww! But that'll be super embarrassing!
Gauntlet of Fire,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,spike,I command you to do it!
Gauntlet of Fire,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,garble,[annoyed noise] I can't believe this...
Gauntlet of Fire,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,princess ember,"Dragon Lord Spike. Hm, has a nice ring to it."
Gauntlet of Fire,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,spike,Dragon Lord Ember sounds a lot better.
Gauntlet of Fire,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,princess ember,What? No. You're the Dragon Lord now.
Gauntlet of Fire,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,spike,"The Dragon Lord is whoever brings the scepter back to your father! Besides, you'll make a great leader. I was just doing this to protect the ponies. But I know you'll protect them just as well as I would have."
Gauntlet of Fire,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,princess ember,You sure about this?
Gauntlet of Fire,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,spike,Absolutely. My home is in Equestria with my friends.
Gauntlet of Fire,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,princess ember,"Well, you'll have at least one friend here too. What are you doing?"
Gauntlet of Fire,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,spike,It's called a hug!
Gauntlet of Fire,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,princess ember,Oh. I don't know if I like it. But... okay.
Gauntlet of Fire,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,spike,Mmmmm!
Gauntlet of Fire,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,[hushed] Awww!
Gauntlet of Fire,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,princess ember,"I know you didn't think I could do it, but I did."
Gauntlet of Fire,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,princess ember,I'm not big and strong. I know. But you know what? I won anyway. So maybe it takes more than just being big and strong to be a good Dragon Lord!
Gauntlet of Fire,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,princess ember,"Thanks, dad. [to dragons] Agree with him! Just kidding! That's not gonna be my thing."
Gauntlet of Fire,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,garble,I can't tell you!
Gauntlet of Fire,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,"You did well, Spike. With Ember as Dragon Lord, the ponies will be safe and you've gained us a powerful ally."
Gauntlet of Fire,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,spike,And a new friend!
Gauntlet of Fire,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,"Plus, Ember said I could write to her anytime I had questions about dragon culture! With this much information, I'll be able to write a whole book on dragons!"
Gauntlet of Fire,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,rarity,"And I gained tons of ideas for a new line of camouflage clothing! I think I'll call it ""Camo-Maud""!"
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,twilight sparkle,"First lesson of the day, we very carefully set the table without using magic, so that<U+0097> Yikes!"
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,twilight sparkle,Did you...?! How? When? What?!
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,starlight glimmer,What?
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,twilight sparkle,I said no magic. You were supposed to do it by hoof so I could work in a friendship lesson.
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,starlight glimmer,"Oh, I heard ""set the table"" and just kinda went for it."
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,twilight sparkle,"Well, if you hadn't used magic, you'd have heard me say, uh... this plate represents your head, this spoon is your heart, and the knives... are sharp! Always be careful with knives. [sigh] The metaphors make more sense when you're actually setting the table."
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,starlight glimmer,Should I... change it back?
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,twilight sparkle,I just want to make sure you're ready for this dinner. Princess Celestia will be joining us tomorrow night to see how the friendship lessons are going!
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,starlight glimmer,"If it's just you, me, and Princess Celestia, why are there four seats?"
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,twilight sparkle,"Well, the whole point is for you to bring a new friend. That way, the princess will see for herself just how far you've come. And how good a teacher you have."
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,starlight glimmer,"Well, I can't choose. I like all your friends."
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,twilight sparkle,That's the best part! You have to make a new friend!
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,starlight glimmer,"New friends? Hey, maybe I'll just force friendships by magically enslaving the entire population of Ponyville!"
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,twilight sparkle,Starlight!
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,starlight glimmer,"Let's see. Make new friends in Ponyville, the friendliest place in Equestria. Shouldn't be hard..."
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,"Need to make a new friend, huh? I know just the pony for you!"
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,"Miss Starlight Glimmer, meet Mrs. Cake!"
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,mrs. cake,"Mrs. How are you, dearie?"
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,starlight glimmer,Are you baking? Can I help?
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,"Wow, Mrs. Cake! Look what your new friend made you!"
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,mrs. cake,Mrs. [chuckles] New friend. I like the sound of<U+0096> [gasps] Howza-wowza! A-Are you trying to put me out of business with your fancy magical-thingy-whatsit cake?!
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,starlight glimmer,Sorry...
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,applejack,"I think I have just the pony for you, Starlight. Meet Big Mac!"
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,big mcintosh,Eeyup!
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,applejack,He's not much of a talker.
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,big mcintosh,Nnope.
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,starlight glimmer,"Oh, that's too bad. I love a good conversation."
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,big mcintosh,[motormouth] Eeyup-yup-yup-yup-yup-yup-yup-yup-y-y-y-y-you did something! Whoa! What's happening? I feel really weird! I'm talkin' so much! And I'm so articulate! Enunciating with such precise pronunciation! Annie Apple awoke and accidentally ate an auburn azalea! [screams] Make it stop!
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,starlight glimmer,I can't be friends with somepony who doesn't talk.
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,starlight glimmer,...And I guess my first instinct shouldn't be to magically command ponies to act the way I want them to?
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,starlight glimmer,"Alright, I'll change him back!"
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,rarity,"The trick to finding a new friend is to render yourself radiant. First impressions count a great deal, you know."
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,starlight glimmer,I'm glad you all got past my first impression.
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,rarity,"Well, everypony deserves a second chance. Ooh! Now, I have a top-notch idea. I'm thinking pastel silk here and here with a crinoline underneath."
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,starlight glimmer,You really think a new outfit will help me meet ponies?
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,rarity,"Oh, with the right outfit, you can do anything, darling!"
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,starlight glimmer,When will it be ready?
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,rarity,Three weeks.
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,starlight glimmer,Dinner's tomorrow.
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,rarity,"Well then, how about a hat from the... [clears throat] ...clearance bin?"
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,starlight glimmer,Ugh! Maybe not.
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,rainbow dash,Heh. Nopony's gonna make friends with you because of your outfit. The only thing you want a new friend draped in is coolness.
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,starlight glimmer,Like you?
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,rainbow dash,"Yeah, but you already know me, so... [gasps] [spitting] Spitfire! Heh. Sorry."
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,starlight glimmer,Who's that?
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,rainbow dash,"[gasps] Only the Wonderbolt-iest pony in the Wonderbolts! Come on, I'll introduce you!"
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,rainbow dash,You coming or what?
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,starlight glimmer,"I guess my first question would be, ""What's a Wonderbolt?"""
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,rainbow dash,[gasps] You've never heard of the Wonderbolts?! Where have you been?!
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,starlight glimmer,"[nervously] Enslaving villages, I guess..."
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,rainbow dash,Right.
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,starlight glimmer,"You're adorable, but probably not what Twilight had in mind."
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,starlight glimmer,"[groan] What is going on? This is Ponyville! If I can't make a friend here, there's gotta be something wrong with me! [sighs] Okay, calm down. Nobody makes friends with a total stresscase."
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,starlight glimmer,[to herself] Stop stressing... Stop stressing!
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,starlight glimmer,[sighs] This is just what I needed.
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,trixie,[sighs] Tell me about it.
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,starlight glimmer,You ever have one of those days?
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,trixie,"For me, they're all one of those days."
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,trixie,I'm gonna start coming here every time I visit Ponyville.
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,starlight glimmer,"I'm not from here either. I've been trying to make friends, but it's not easy. They're not saying it, but I think everypony knows about my past. I may have been a tiny bit... completely and utterly evil?"
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,trixie,Ponies judge me on my past too.
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,starlight glimmer,"Finally, a pony I can relate to."
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,starlight glimmer,"Twilight, guess what? I made a new friend!"
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,twilight sparkle,That's fantastic news!
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,starlight glimmer,She's great!
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,twilight sparkle,Great!
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,starlight glimmer,She's powerful!
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,twilight sparkle,Powerful?
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,starlight glimmer,She's<U+0097>
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,trixie,Hello... princess!
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,twilight sparkle,Trixie?!
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,starlight glimmer,You know each other?
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,twilight sparkle,You could say that.
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,trixie,"We've had our differences. What matters is Twilight gave me a second chance, and I appreciate it."
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,twilight sparkle,"So, um, what brings you to Ponyville?"
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,trixie,"The Grrrreat and Powerful Trrrrixie has come to perform a new stage show of grand illusion! I am calling it ""The Humble and Penitent Trixie's Equestrian Apology Tour""!"
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,starlight glimmer,[hushed] That's kind of a mouthful.
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,trixie,[hushed] It's a working title.
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,twilight sparkle,"Starlight? A moment? Over here? [hushed] I know I said make friends with anypony, but, well, with Trixie's past, and your past, I'm not sure she's the best... first friend."
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,starlight glimmer,"But whatever she did, you've forgiven her, right?"
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,twilight sparkle,Of course. It's just... She wasn't the nicest pony.
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,starlight glimmer,"Well, you did say anypony, and I just assumed that you'd trust me to make my own friends the way Princess Celestia trusted you."
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,twilight sparkle,[sighs] You're right. I trust you. Just be back in time for the dinner.
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,starlight glimmer,"Thanks, Twilight! You won't regret it!"
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,trixie,This magic show's gonna be the greatest thing Ponyville's ever seen!
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,trixie,"Everypony always says they'll give you a second chance, but deep down, they never forget."
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,starlight glimmer,That's what I'm worried about.
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,starlight glimmer,What is it?
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,trixie,"I heard what Twilight said about me, and she's right. I wasn't very nice. So I'd understand if you didn't want to be friends."
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,starlight glimmer,Are you kidding? You're the first pony I've met who has any idea how I feel!
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,trixie,Can you keep a secret?
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,starlight glimmer,What are friends for?
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,trixie,"[hushed] The things I've done? I did them because I was jealous of Twilight. She's just the best at everything, and I wanted to beat her at something!"
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,starlight glimmer,[hushed] Your secret's safe with me.
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,trixie,Thanks. Want to help me unpack my wagon?
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,trixie,"I spend a lot of time on the road with my wagon, so it might be a tad messy."
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,starlight glimmer,"Maybe I can help. I'm pretty good at organizing stuff. Magic props, brainwashed crowds..."
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,twilight sparkle,Pssssssst! Pssst! Psssssst! Shhhhhh!
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,starlight glimmer,"Uh, I'll catch up. I think there's something in my hoof."
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,trixie,Sure. The wagon's right around the corner.
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,twilight sparkle,"[hushed] So, how's it going with your new friend?"
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,starlight glimmer,[sarcastically] Great. Thanks for asking in a completely not creepy way.
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,twilight sparkle,"Because you know, if it isn't working out for any reason, I could introduce you to my friend here."
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,starlight glimmer,[deadpan] Nice to meet you.
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,twilight sparkle,"No, no! You can come out now!"
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,twilight sparkle,"You like music, right? DJ Pon-3'd be the perfect friend for tonight's incredibly important dinner with Celestia. You know, if you decide to make a last-minute change. Heh."
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,starlight glimmer,"So back at your castle when you said ""I trust you"", you meant ""I don't trust you""."
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,twilight sparkle,[nervously] Who can really say who said what? I know I can't! [to DJ Pon-3] Can you?
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,twilight sparkle,"Starlight, I'm just trying to look out for you."
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,starlight glimmer,"[sighs] I appreciate it, but you're wrong about Trixie. She's just like me. We have a real connection."
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,twilight sparkle,That's kind of what I'm afraid of. Oh! What about her?
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,starlight glimmer,"Please, Twilight! I know you're trying to help, but I need to make friends on my own if I'm going to become a better pony."
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,twilight sparkle,But do you really think Trixie's the one to help you with that?
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,starlight glimmer,Wow. Trixie was right. You're not really giving her a second chance. I wonder what that says about how you feel about me.
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,twilight sparkle,Oh! Now he'd be perfect!
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,starlight glimmer,"I was thinking. You said Twilight is better than you at everything, but that's not true. You're better at magic."
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,trixie,"Only when I'm wearing a soul-sucking evil amulet, so I don't think that counts. Funny story. Don't need to get into it."
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,starlight glimmer,I meant stage magic.
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,trixie,"Well, of course! Great? Yes. Powerful? Obviously. But I'm not the best. As great and powerful as I am, there's one trick I've never been able to do <U+0096> the Moonshot Manticore Mouth Dive!"
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,trixie,"[narrating] Only one magician has ever pulled it off <U+0096> my hero, Hoofdini! You are supposed to blast yourself into the open mouth of a hungry manticore! After the manticore chews you up and swallows you, you magically step out of a box on the other side of the stage!"
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,trixie,Completely unharmed!
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,starlight glimmer,That sounds very...
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,trixie,Dangerous?
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,starlight glimmer,I was gonna say cool!
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,trixie,"I knew I liked you for a reason. I don't know how he did it! If I tried it, I'd get chewed up and swallowed by that manticore."
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,starlight glimmer,Not if you could use real magic.
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,trixie,Obviously. Way to rub it in.
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,starlight glimmer,"No, I mean, I could help! You could start the trick, and right before you got chewed up, I could use magic to save you..."
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,starlight glimmer,...and make you appear in the black box!
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,trixie,"I guess that would work... But if you made one mistake, I'd be a goner."
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,starlight glimmer,"Hah. When it comes to magic, I don't make mistakes. Maybe I could be your... magic show helper pony!"
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,trixie,"We call it ""assistant"" in the magician biz. And... nopony's ever offered to help before."
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,starlight glimmer,"Well, I'd be honored."
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,trixie,You may have just made my great and powerful magic show even better! Which I didn't think was possible! We're gonna blow them away tonight!
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,starlight glimmer,[groans] I can't! Tonight's this incredibly important dinner with Twilight.
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,trixie,Oh.
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,starlight glimmer,Can I vent for a minute?
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,trixie,What are friends for?
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,starlight glimmer,"Even after Twilight says she trusts me, she clearly doesn't trust me enough to choose my own friends. [sighs] I guess you were right. No second chances."
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,trixie,"Hmph, I wish I could say I was surprised. Well, lucky for Princess Twilight, I have my magic show tonight. If you have to go to the dinner, I completely understand. [dramatically] I just hope I find a way to survive the Moonshot Manticore Mouth Dive without my new assistant!"
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,twilight sparkle,Starlight? Has anyone seen Starlight Glimmer? I'm looking for her! Trixie.
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,So this is the Humble and Penitent Trixie's Equestrian Apology Tour?
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,applejack,Ain't that a mouthful of molasses.
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,trixie,"It's a working title! Oh, this is gonna be the greatest night of my life! Excuse me. Our lives."
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,starlight glimmer,[sighs] I'm so glad we're not at that boring dinner.
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,twilight sparkle,"Ahem? You just decided to skip our dinner without telling me? Are you aware that, at this very moment, Princess Celestia is waiting for you at a table with exquisite silverware placement?!"
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,starlight glimmer,"Yes, but<U+0097>"
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,twilight sparkle,This is exactly why I didn't want you to make friends with Trixie.
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,trixie,"A-ha! You still don't trust me! But guess what, princess? It doesn't matter if you want to give me a second chance or not. Starlight had to choose between you and me, and she chose me! Your pupil chose me, so ha! I win!"
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,starlight glimmer,You win? That sounds like you just made friends with me to beat Twilight.
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,trixie,"Exactly! [beat] Wait! I mean, no! I got caught up in the moment. I like you. Beating Twilight is just a bonus. [gasps] Saying that didn't help, did it?"
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,twilight sparkle,"Well, you won. I hope you're happy!"
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,trixie,[sighs] Looks like the Great and Powerful Trixie is back to a solo show.
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,twilight sparkle,Trixie?
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,trixie,"...Which is exactly the way she likes it! Thank you, Princess Twilight, for getting rid of that annoying pony who wanted to be my first friend! I am not sad at all! I definitely don't feel as if my heart is breaking into a million pieces!"
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,trixie,"[unenthusiastic] Come one, come all. Come and see the Pathetic and Friendless Trixie's ""Way-To-Go-Dum-Dum-You-Really-Messed-It-Up-This-Time Repentance Tour""."
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,trixie,"It's a working title! [unenthusiastic] Behold, your fears come true. A pony-eating manticore."
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,trixie,"[unenthusiastic] For tonight, the Great and Powerful Trixie will be performing the Moonshot Manticore Mouth Dive."
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,trixie,"[unenthusiastic] Now, now, save your gasps for when I defy the beast's jaws of doom and appear inside that black box. [dramatically] I was supposed to perform this trick with my great and powerful assistant, who was also my great and powerful friend!"
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,twilight sparkle,"Starlight, when I first came to Ponyville, Princess Celestia gave me room to make my own decisions and my own friends. I need to give you the same freedom. I shouldn't have tried to pick and choose your friends for you. Just like me, you have to make your own decisions and your own friends."
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,starlight glimmer,But... what if Trixie really was using me just to one-up you?
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,twilight sparkle,"From what I've seen, she's the real thing."
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,twilight sparkle,But it's not my place to judge. It's all up to you.
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,trixie,"Starlight? If you're out there and you still want to be friends, let's be great and powerful together! [slightly echoing] Please?"
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,trixie,"[woozy] Behold, the Peat and Growerful Triskie...!"
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,trixie,"[amplified] And now, I'm proud to introduce my great and powerful assistant! [normal] And best friend. [amplified] Starlight Glimmer!"
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,twilight sparkle,Trixie!
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,trixie,What do you want?
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,twilight sparkle,I was wrong. I'm sorry. And I have to hand it to you. I could never have pulled off a trick like that.
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,trixie,"Thank you, princess."
No Second Prances,Nick Confalone,cranky doodle donkey,How do you get your hair to do that all the time?
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,scootaloo,Hey! Rainbow Dash!
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,rainbow dash,"Hiya, Scootaloo! What's up?"
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,scootaloo,The Rainbow Dash Fan Club just decided <U+0096> everypony's coming to see you when the Wonderbolts' new tour comes through Ponyville!
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,rainbow dash,"Well, it's great that you guys are going to the show, Scoot, but I won't actually be performing in it. Reservists aren't in the show unless one of the real Wonderbolts can't fly. [chuckles] I'll probably be working crowd control or something."
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,scootaloo,"You're still gonna be wearing a Wonderbolts uniform though, right?"
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,rainbow dash,"A Reservist one, yeah."
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,scootaloo,Hmm. That's good enough for me.
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,scootaloo,Whoa!
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,spitfire,Rainbow Dash! Glad we found you. We need you in the show when we get to Ponyville. Flying.
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,scootaloo,But she's only in the Reserves!
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,spitfire,"Not anymore, kid."
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,rainbow dash,[slow gasp] You mean...
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,scootaloo,"[gasps] Rainbow Dash! You're finally a full-fledged Wonderbolt! Woo-hoo! [laughs] Yeah, Rainbow Dash! Whoo!"
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,spitfire,Heh. What she said.
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,rainbow dash,"Uh, anypony seen my wing balm? I don't want to be stiff when I show up at Wonderbolt headquarters."
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,spike,Got it!
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,twilight sparkle,"Do you have time to tell us what happened, Rainbow Dash?"
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,rarity,"Oh, yes, we must know every detail!"
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,pinkie pie,Start from when you were a foal and you first knew your destiny was to become a Wonderbolt!
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,rainbow dash,"Heh. Well, not much to tell, really. Spitfire told me the Wonderbolts need me to go on tour with them."
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,fluttershy,That's really great. I know how long you've been waiting for a spot to open up.
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,rainbow dash,Yeah. Fire Streak decided to retire and teach full-time. Cloudsdale Flight School will probably be churning out Wonderbolts with him there. But guess who was at the top of the Reserve list.
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,pinkie pie,"Ooh, ooh, I know! Pick me!"
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,rarity,"So what do you do now, Dashie?"
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,rainbow dash,"I have to report to Wonderbolts headquarters this afternoon. It's only two days 'til tour starts, and I need to learn the routine."
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,pinkie pie,You're leaving already?! [gasps] But we barely started your congratulation party! I haven't even thought about your going-away party yet!
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,rainbow dash,"Pinkie, I'm not leaving Ponyville. I just have to train for this show."
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,fluttershy,I hope everything goes well. Sounds like an awful lot of pressure having to learn everything so quickly.
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,applejack,"Yeah. Good luck, Dash."
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,rainbow dash,Luck? Heh. Save that for the rest of the team.
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,rainbow dash,"Now that my awesomeness has finally been recognized, the other Wonderbolts will have to keep up or eat my cloud trail!"
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,twilight sparkle,"Everypony knows you're a great flyer, Rainbow Dash, but so are the rest of the Wonderbolts. It might be more challenging than you think."
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,rainbow dash,"Aw, you're right! I mean, do I show up wearing sunglasses or not? Sunglasses are automatically cool, but anypony can put them on. Maybe I'd stand out more if I didn't."
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,spitfire,Team briefings are every morning at<U+0097>
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,rainbow dash,"0720, because there were twenty ponies in the original E.U.P. Guard that became the Wonderbolts!"
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,spitfire,"Right. And I know you've seen the academy bunks, but these are the official Wonderbolts barracks."
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,rainbow dash,Built by Admiral Fairweather himself!
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,spitfire,"Don't forget rule number one, newbie. Always check both ways before crossing the runway."
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,rainbow dash,"Uh, sure, but... nopony else is here."
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,spitfire,"They will be, and most of the Wonderbolts like to make a flashy entrance, so stay alert."
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,rainbow dash,"Right, no problem!"
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,rainbow dash,Whoa! Is that General Flash's cap?!
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,spitfire,And the original crest with the Wonderbolts motto on it.
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,rainbow dash,"Wow! [gasps] I mean, ha, cool."
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,spitfire,"Okay, newbie, we've got a show in two days, which means you gotta hustle your haunches to learn this routine. You got five minutes to get dressed and get outside to meet the rest of the team."
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,rainbow dash,"Yes, ma'am! I'll have all of the moves down by the end of the day!"
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,spitfire,Let's hope so. We're all expecting you to make quite an impression.
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,rainbow dash,"Lookin' good! Okay, you're about to take your first flight as an actual Wonderbolt. [sighs] No pressure. [stretching groan] Just gotta go out there and knock 'em off their hooves. Okay, Wonderbolts, get ready to meet your most awesome member ever!"
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,spitfire,"Hey, look out!"
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,rainbow dash,Huh? Whooaaa!
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,soarin,"Are you okay, Rainbow Dash?"
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,young rainbow dash,"Okay, flight school! Get ready for Rainbow Dash! Hah<U+0097>whooooa!"
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,rainbow dash,Hey! You guys buzzed me on purpose!
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,spitfire,"Not quite. You forgot rule number one, newbie."
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,rainbow dash,"Yeah, well, I was just... testing you guys!"
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,spitfire,"Alright, nopony got hurt and we got a lot to do, so let's forget about this and get flying!"
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,spitfire,"[through loudhailer] Higher, Crash! You're breaking formation!"
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,soarin,"Check your nine, Crash!"
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,spitfire,"Tighter, Crash, get in there!"
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,rainbow dash,[growls] My name's not Crash!
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,rainbow dash,"Tough day? Please. If I can pull off a sonic rainboom, I can learn this routine. I'll have it down cold tomorrow. Probably even come up with a couple of improvements."
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,spitfire,"Rainbow Dash, over here!"
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,rainbow dash,"Yes, ma'am!"
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,spitfire,I'm glad you're still here.
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,rainbow dash,"Oh, yeah? Did you want some ideas on how to make the show extra-awesome?"
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,spitfire,"Not quite. I know you've been a Reservist for a while, but the 'Bolts have a few of their own rules you might not know about. Like worst flyer of the day has to clean up the whole compound. Better get to it, Crash."
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,rainbow dash,[sighs] [under her breath] My name's not Crash.
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,rainbow dash,What?
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,cutie mark crusaders,"Hooray, Rainbow Dash! Our favorite Wonderbolt!"
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,twilight sparkle,"We know you're probably tired, Rainbow Dash, but Pinkie wanted to throw you a real party."
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,pinkie pie,Your best day [through megaphone] ever party!
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,rainbow dash,"[nervous laugh] Yeah. It was somethin', all right."
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,applejack,Well we can't wait to hear all about it!
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,rainbow dash,"Heh. And I'd love to tell you, I really would, but I'm pretty beat. [yawns] You know, from all the... excitement of my big day?"
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,fluttershy,"Um, is something wrong, Rainbow Dash?"
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,rainbow dash,"What could be wrong? I'm finally a Wonderbolt, which means everything has to be totally, perfectly awesome."
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,rarity,"Oh, no. Something is wrong. What happened, darling?"
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,rainbow dash,"I told you, it's nothing! I mean, maybe some of the Wonderbolts started calling me Rainbow Crash..."
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,fluttershy,"Oh, no! Isn't that the same terrible nickname those bullies in flight school used to call you?"
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,twilight sparkle,Why would they call you that?
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,twilight sparkle,Urgh.
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,pinkie pie,"Well, look at the bright side! At least they didn't call you Rainbow Trash!"
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,applejack,So you started off on the wrong hoof. I'll bet every new Wonderbolt has a tough first day.
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,rarity,"Mmm-hmm! What you need is to find a positive way to stand out. As soon as you're known for something else, that nasty old nickname will be forgotten."
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,twilight sparkle,"Rarity's right. Why don't you think of the Wonderbolts like us? We're a team, but we all stand out in different ways."
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,rainbow dash,"That's it! I'm gonna stand out in a different way, just like you guys! Goodbye, Rainbow Crash; hello, Captain Awesome!"
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,rainbow dash,"[imitating Pinkie Pie] Good morning, everypony! Who's ready for a fantastic day of flying? I know I am! I just couldn't be more excited for the big show tomorrow. Are you guys excited? I'm excited! Actually, I'm always excited! Some ponies even call me ""Dynamic Dash""!"
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,rainbow dash,"[sighs] [imitating Applejack] Well, of course I know that! But the truth of the matter is, you should be excited! It's the dream of near every little Pegasus pony to grow up and fly with the Wonderbolts! And here you all are doin' it!"
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,rainbow dash,"[imitating Applejack] True! Go ahead and call me ""Forthright Filly"" if you want. But shee-yucks, I like to tell it like it is, and I believe a pony oughta appreciate hard work payin' off like this, because bein' a Wonderbolt is somethin' special!"
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,rainbow dash,"[imitating Twilight Sparkle] You know, I was just reading about how dihedral wing angles can help increase stability in banking turns. It made me think that pre-flight checklists could really help increase our efficiency, so I went ahead and made them for everypony!"
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,rainbow dash,"[imitating Twilight Sparkle] I'm always finding so much interesting information in books. In fact, a lot of ponies call me ""Reading Rainboom""."
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,spitfire,"[through loudhailer] We all know how wings work, newbie! And we already have checklists! Now get off the runway!"
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,rainbow dash,"[imitating Fluttershy] I'm so sorry. I was just trying to help because I care about all of the Wonderbolts oh-so much. Yessiree, just call me ""Care Mare"". [beat] Um, but if you're busy now, I can just come back later..."
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,rainbow dash,"[imitating Fluttershy] Or, you know, not at all..."
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,rainbow dash,"[to herself] Okay. [imitating Rarity] I must tell you how much I just love these uniforms. Why, ever since I was a foal, I've admired the mixture of bold lines and classic contours. They don't call me ""Rainbow Fash"" for nothing."
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,soarin,Uhhhh... huh...?
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,rainbow dash,"[imitating Rarity] The ""Fash"" is for ""Fashion""."
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,spitfire,"Crash! I'm not sure why you're acting like this, but you need to stop."
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,rainbow dash,"I was just, you know, trying to show everypony all the awesome ways I can contribute to the 'Bolts."
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,spitfire,"I know you're excited to find your place on the team, but just focus on the routine for now, okay?"
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,rainbow dash,"Yes, ma'am."
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,spitfire,Maybe this will help motivate you.
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,rainbow dash,Crash?! Couldn't you just put my regular name on it?!
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,spitfire,"That's not how it works around here. We all have our nicknames on our jackets. Right, Clipper?"
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,rainbow dash,Clipper?
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,soarin,"Right, boss!"
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,rainbow dash,"[groans] If I don't come up with something unforgettable to add to the routine, I'm gonna be Rainbow Crash for the rest of my life!"
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,scootaloo,This is gonna be so amazing!
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,spike,I know! I'm almost as excited as Pinkie Pie!
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,pinkie pie,I can't wait to see Rainbow Dash's first performance as an honest-to-goodness Wonderbolt! I hope there's cotton candy!
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,fluttershy,We should all remember to be extra supportive for Rainbow Dash too.
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,rarity,Excellent point. It's simply dreadful that she's had such a rough start after finally achieving her dream.
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,twilight sparkle,Rainbow Dash is a pretty resilient pony. I'm sure she's shaken off her tough first day and turned it around by now!
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,applejack,"Speakin' of... Hey, Dash!"
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,rainbow dash,"Perfect! Hey, can I borrow Scootaloo?"
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,scootaloo,Me? What for?
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,rainbow dash,"Oh, heh, I just needed some help and figured the president of the Rainbow Dash Fan Club was the right pony for the job!"
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,twilight sparkle,I thought the Wonderbolt Reserves were here to help.
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,rainbow dash,"Oh, yeah, they're all busy doing, uh, official Reserve stuff. But don't worry! With Scootaloo's help, everything's gonna be awesome. Better than awesome!"
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,rarity,Does... Does that mean practice went well yesterday?
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,rainbow dash,Gotta go.
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,scootaloo,"What are we doing up here, Rainbow Dash?"
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,rainbow dash,"I just need a small favor from you that's really gonna make this show something special. Now, the Wonderbolts are gonna fly over this ridge right before the finale of the show. I'll fly by last, and when I signal you, you zip up the ramp on your scooter and kick the storm cloud into my path!"
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,scootaloo,What?
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,rainbow dash,"That kick will shoot off a lightning bolt right behind me, making me look totally awesome! And then I'll do some incredible Rainbow Dash flying with it to create the coolest, show-stoppingest, lightning-tastic light show anypony has ever seen!"
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,scootaloo,Are you sure about this?
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,rainbow dash,"Uh-huh! It's gonna be so awesome! And nopony will ever call me ""Rainbow Crash"" after this!"
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,rainbow dash,"Oh, gotta go! Be ready for me, okay, Scootaloo?"
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,scootaloo,Um... okay...?
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,fluttershy,"I hope Spike and Pinkie Pie are done getting their snacks, or they're gonna miss Rainbow Dash!"
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,rarity,"Oh, don't worry, Fluttershy. Nothing would keep Pinkie Pie from missing this!"
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,applejack,Heh. Except maybe cotton candy.
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,spike,"Come on, Pinkie, the show's starting!"
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,pinkie pie,"One second! Just a little bit bigger please, but hurry! Bigger!"
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,twilight sparkle,That was amazing! She's doing great!
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,pinkie pie,Bigger!
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,scootaloo,I hope this works.
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,pinkie pie,Hope I'm not too late. [scoffs] I dunno what took that pony so long.
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,pinkie pie,That was amazing!
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,spitfire,"Way to go, Rainbow Crash."
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,spitfire,"You gonna tell us what just happened, newbie?"
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,rainbow dash,[sighs] I'm so sorry.
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,spitfire,I should hope so. You changed the routine without consulting me and put other ponies at risk. I've drummed flyers out of the 'Bolts for less.
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,rainbow dash,"I know, and I'm ready for whatever punishment you want. You guys were right to call me ""Rainbow Crash"". I've always been a standout flyer, but since I joined the Wonderbolts, I've only stood out for making mistakes. [sighs] It's been my dream my whole life, but... I guess maybe I'm not Wonderbolt material after all."
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,soarin,Are you serious?! You're the most talented flyer we've ever had!
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,rainbow dash,"Uh, I<U+0097>"
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,spitfire,Of course you're supposed to be a Wonderbolt. We've been waiting for a spot to open up ever since you joined the Reserves!
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,rainbow dash,But... you guys all called me Rainbow Crash.
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,soarin,"Yeah, so? My nickname's ""Clipper"". You know why they call me that?"
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,rainbow dash,Uh... 'cause you're as fast as a ship?
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,soarin,Because I clipped my wing on a flagpole as I was landing on my first day. Heh.
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,rainbow dash,Huh.
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,rainbow dash,Whoa! That is so much worse than Crash.
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,spitfire,Right?
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,rainbow dash,So does this mean I'm... still on the team?
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,spitfire,Do you think you can be part of this team and not constantly try to showboat?
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,rainbow dash,"I promise! I spent my whole life trying to be a standout flyer, but now that I'm a Wonderbolt, it's time to be okay with fitting in!"
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,spitfire,"Good, because I really didn't want to miss the chance to tease you for years about this catastrophe! I mean, that crash was epic!"
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,spitfire,But you're on probation for a month. Got a problem with that?!
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,rainbow dash,"[quickly] No, ma'am."
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,twilight sparkle,Hey. Rainbow Dash. We just wanted to check on you. Are you doing okay?
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,rainbow dash,"I'm doing great, thanks!"
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,scootaloo,Sure you don't need any help?
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,rainbow dash,"Nah. This mess is my responsibility, and I've gotta clean it up myself. And after this, Spitfire's got me cleaning the Wonderbolts' compound for the next month."
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,scootaloo,So why are you in such a good mood?
Newbie Dash,Dave Rapp; story by Dave Polsky & Dave Rapp,rainbow dash,Duh! Because I'm a Wonderbolt!
A Hearth's Warming Tail,Michael Vogel,fluttershy,Clouds arranged so they're just so
A Hearth's Warming Tail,Michael Vogel,rainbow dash,Gonna make some awesome snow
A Hearth's Warming Tail,Michael Vogel,pinkie pie,A day that's filled with songs to sing

A Hearth's Warming Tail,Michael Vogel,rarity,Perfection you just cannot fake
A Hearth's Warming Tail,Michael Vogel,rarity,"Not one mistake Don't let that break Oh, goodness' sake!"
A Hearth's Warming Tail,Michael Vogel,twilight sparkle,"Hey, Starlight! Ready to celebrate your first Hearth's Warming Eve here in Ponyville?"
A Hearth's Warming Tail,Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,I was thinking I might just skip it.
A Hearth's Warming Tail,Michael Vogel,spike,Skip Hearth's Warming Eve?!
A Hearth's Warming Tail,Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,"I just find it all a little silly. It's mostly a day dedicated to presents and candy, isn't it?"
A Hearth's Warming Tail,Michael Vogel,spike,And why would you deny yourself presents and candy? That's crazy talk!
A Hearth's Warming Tail,Michael Vogel,twilight sparkle,I think what Spike means to say is Hearth's Warming is about more than presents and candy. It's a time to spend with friends and family when we celebrate a very important day in Equestria's history.
A Hearth's Warming Tail,Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,"I think to most ponies, it's just an excuse for silly songs and fun, not a day to remember some old story."
A Hearth's Warming Tail,Michael Vogel,twilight sparkle,Maybe you just haven't heard the right Hearth's Warming Eve story yet!
A Hearth's Warming Tail,Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,"Earth ponies, Pegasi, and unicorns sing songs around a hearth to fight back an eternal winter caused by the mythical windigos? Ha! Every foal and filly knows that story."
A Hearth's Warming Tail,Michael Vogel,twilight sparkle,"Not that one. My favorite holiday story, ""A Hearth's Warming Tale""!"
A Hearth's Warming Tail,Michael Vogel,spike,"Oh, I love that one!"
A Hearth's Warming Tail,Michael Vogel,twilight sparkle,"This is the story of a powerful unicorn named Snowfall Frost, who hated Hearth's Warming Eve. It all began many moons ago in Canterlot..."
A Hearth's Warming Tail,Michael Vogel,twilight sparkle,"[narrating] Every home in Canterlot was filled with holiday spirit. Every home... except one. It was said of Snowfall that she was almost as studied as Star Swirl the Bearded. Almost, since everypony knows that Star Swirl was an expert at everything from transfiguration, dimensional calibration, teleportation<U+0097>"
A Hearth's Warming Tail,Michael Vogel,spike,[narrating] We get it. Star Swirl's awesome.
A Hearth's Warming Tail,Michael Vogel,twilight sparkle,"[narrating] Right. The point is, Snowfall was also a powerful unicorn. She wanted to be perfect. Anything that got in the way of that was a waste of time."
A Hearth's Warming Tail,Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,"[gasp] Well, that batch is ruined. Snowdash!"
A Hearth's Warming Tail,Michael Vogel,twilight sparkle,[narrating] Snowdash was Snowfall's loyal assistant.
A Hearth's Warming Tail,Michael Vogel,rainbow dash,What do you need?
A Hearth's Warming Tail,Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,Get this mess cleaned up. Those foolish ponies were ringing those blasted bells outside the window and I lost my concentration!
A Hearth's Warming Tail,Michael Vogel,rainbow dash,"[under her breath] Whoa, ponies actually enjoying Hearth's Warming Eve. Where did they get that crazy idea?"
A Hearth's Warming Tail,Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,Today is nothing to celebrate. Hearth's Warming Eve is a menace. A dangerous day for all of Equestria.
A Hearth's Warming Tail,Michael Vogel,rainbow dash,"Dangerous?! It's awesome! It's the day we remember how unicorns, Pegasi, and Earth ponies came together in friendship to defeat the windigos!"
A Hearth's Warming Tail,Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,"That silly legend is the problem! Telling everypony that ""singing songs and being nice"" will solve anything? I've spent years studying magic, and that's not how it works."
A Hearth's Warming Tail,Michael Vogel,rainbow dash,I think you might be missing the point.
A Hearth's Warming Tail,Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,"Work hard, learn, and use your skills to better Equestria. That's a worthy goal for any pony. [sarcastically] But, by all means, if you want to go home early, ignore all of the work you have, and spend the rest<U+0097>"
A Hearth's Warming Tail,Michael Vogel,rainbow dash,Sweet!
A Hearth's Warming Tail,Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,Ugh!
A Hearth's Warming Tail,Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,I hate Hearth's Warming Eve! All of Equestria would be better off if we just skipped the day altogether.
A Hearth's Warming Tail,Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,"Happy Hearth's Warming, they say in the street Happy Hearth's Warming, they think they're so sweet Words said so often that they lack any meaning Why should I join in when I could be intervening?"
A Hearth's Warming Tail,Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,"Once the spell is cast, all of Equestria will be better off, and they'll have me to thank for it!"
A Hearth's Warming Tail,Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,Wait a minute. Snowfall doesn't like Hearth's Warming Eve so she decides to cast a spell to get rid of it altogether? That seems a little extreme.
A Hearth's Warming Tail,Michael Vogel,twilight sparkle,"I think what Spike is trying to say is that everypony has their reasons for doing things. Even Snowfall. And if I could continue the story, we might just find out what they are."
A Hearth's Warming Tail,Michael Vogel,spike,Proceed.
A Hearth's Warming Tail,Michael Vogel,twilight sparkle,Snowfall was all set to cast her spell that would erase Hearth's Warming Eve for all time...
A Hearth's Warming Tail,Michael Vogel,twilight sparkle,[narrating] ...when a voice from the hearth caught her attention.
A Hearth's Warming Tail,Michael Vogel,applejack,You sure you wanna go through with this?
A Hearth's Warming Tail,Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,Huh?! Who's there?!
A Hearth's Warming Tail,Michael Vogel,applejack,"The Spirit of Hearth's Warmin' Past, that's who. And you and me have got to have us a little chat."
A Hearth's Warming Tail,Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,A spirit?! [suspiciously] I didn't cast any spirit summoning spell. What are you doing here?
A Hearth's Warming Tail,Michael Vogel,applejack,"You don't think a spell like that would get by without some powerful forces noticin'? You've got our attention, Snowfall Frost, and we've got some pretty strong opinions on this spell of yours."
A Hearth's Warming Tail,Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,"""We""?"
A Hearth's Warming Tail,Michael Vogel,applejack,"They'll be along in a bit. For now, it's just you and me. Let's get a move on. We got a ton to see and barely any time to see it."
A Hearth's Warming Tail,Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,"I'm not going anywhere. I've got a spell to cast, and I don't need a history lesson about Hearth's Warming Eve."
A Hearth's Warming Tail,Michael Vogel,applejack,We aren't goin' to the past to learn about the holiday. We're goin' to learn about you.
A Hearth's Warming Tail,Michael Vogel,applejack,"As a young thing, life sure is somethin' You go makin' choices large and small Always growin' like a seedlin' And playin' is like dreamin' And before you know it, big and tall"
A Hearth's Warming Tail,Michael Vogel,applejack,"Then some distress, words so careless Standin' there, you don't know what to do Feelin' helpless, you can't make it hurt less So you go and change your point of view"
A Hearth's Warming Tail,Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,The seeds of the past We grow up so fast Some hurts never go away
A Hearth's Warming Tail,Michael Vogel,applejack,"The seeds, as they grow This we can't let go All tied to this one holiday"
A Hearth's Warming Tail,Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,[gasps] Spirit? What am I supposed to<U+0097>
A Hearth's Warming Tail,Michael Vogel,pinkie pie,"[reverberating] Snowfall Frost! It is I, the Spirit of Hearth's Warming Presents!"
A Hearth's Warming Tail,Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,"Um, don't you mean ""Present"", like the time?"
A Hearth's Warming Tail,Michael Vogel,pinkie pie,"No! Toys, Hearth's Warming doll... Here, want a cupcake?"
A Hearth's Warming Tail,Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,"Fine, ""Presents"". All of the pointless things ponies waste their time on."
A Hearth's Warming Tail,Michael Vogel,pinkie pie,"Oh, Snowfall, it's not what the gift is that matters, it's what the gift means!"
A Hearth's Warming Tail,Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,It doesn't mean anything. It's just stuff!
A Hearth's Warming Tail,Michael Vogel,pinkie pie,"Exactly! Sometimes a cupcake means ""I love you!"" Or a toy means ""Hi, how're you doing?"" Sometimes a book means ""Your mane looks amazing!"" And sometimes a scarf means... Well, a scarf usually means you look cold. That one's easy."
A Hearth's Warming Tail,Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,I don't understand anything you're saying.
A Hearth's Warming Tail,Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,What's happening to you?!
A Hearth's Warming Tail,Michael Vogel,pinkie pie,My Spirit of Hearth's Warming Presents Sense is going off! That means a song is coming on!
A Hearth's Warming Tail,Michael Vogel,pinkie pie,"Take a look at everything around you All the smells that surely will astound you Open up your heart, it will surround you In the magic of Hearth's Warming Eve"
A Hearth's Warming Tail,Michael Vogel,twilight sparkle,"[singsong, as Pinkie Pie] And the reason is to be with your friends! [normal] What?"
A Hearth's Warming Tail,Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,"You know you're doing your Pinkie Pie voice, right?"
A Hearth's Warming Tail,Michael Vogel,twilight sparkle,I was not!
A Hearth's Warming Tail,Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,"So, what happens next?"
A Hearth's Warming Tail,Michael Vogel,twilight sparkle,"Well, the party was<U+0097>"
A Hearth's Warming Tail,Michael Vogel,spike,Wait! Can we take a quick break? I need to refill my cocoa.
A Hearth's Warming Tail,Michael Vogel,twilight sparkle,[groans] Fine. But hurry up! We're almost to the best part!
A Hearth's Warming Tail,Michael Vogel,spike,"[blows] Okay, I'm ready."
A Hearth's Warming Tail,Michael Vogel,twilight sparkle,The party was in full swing.
A Hearth's Warming Tail,Michael Vogel,rarity,Snowdash!
A Hearth's Warming Tail,Michael Vogel,rainbow dash,"Hey, Merry."
A Hearth's Warming Tail,Michael Vogel,rarity,"Why, whatever is the matter, darling?"
A Hearth's Warming Tail,Michael Vogel,fluttershy,"Was it the eggnog? Oh, I knew I put in too much cinnamon!"
A Hearth's Warming Tail,Michael Vogel,rainbow dash,"Oh, no, the eggnog was awesome, Flutterholly, I'm just mad at somepony who was complaining about how awful Hearth's Warming Eve is."
A Hearth's Warming Tail,Michael Vogel,rarity,"I don't suppose that pony's name starts with ""Snow""?"
A Hearth's Warming Tail,Michael Vogel,fluttershy,"And ends with ""Frost""?"
A Hearth's Warming Tail,Michael Vogel,rainbow dash,"She said Hearth's Warming Eve is just an excuse to party, and we would all be better off spending time working to make Equestria a better place."
A Hearth's Warming Tail,Michael Vogel,rarity,What does Snowfall think a better Equestria looks like?
A Hearth's Warming Tail,Michael Vogel,rainbow dash,"Ponies working hard, learning, and using their abilities for the benefit of Equestria."
A Hearth's Warming Tail,Michael Vogel,rarity,[muffled] It looks like we've got everything on Snowfall's list right here.
A Hearth's Warming Tail,Michael Vogel,fluttershy,I think a perfect Equestria looks a lot like a Hearth's Warming Eve party.
A Hearth's Warming Tail,Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,Spirit? What do you mean? What's going to happen?!
A Hearth's Warming Tail,Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,Who are you?
A Hearth's Warming Tail,Michael Vogel,princess luna,I am the Spirit of Hearth's Warming Yet to Come.
A Hearth's Warming Tail,Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,Are you here to show me what future Hearth's Warming Eves are like?
A Hearth's Warming Tail,Michael Vogel,princess luna,"No, for there are no more Hearth's Warming Eves for me to show."
A Hearth's Warming Tail,Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,Why not?
A Hearth's Warming Tail,Michael Vogel,princess luna,"You will succeed in erasing the holiday, as you wished."
A Hearth's Warming Tail,Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,And what happens?
A Hearth's Warming Tail,Michael Vogel,princess luna,I see a cold wind blowing through I see days neither fun nor free I see a future caused by you I see a path not meant to be
A Hearth's Warming Tail,Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,Windigos?! They aren't real! It's just a little filly's story!
A Hearth's Warming Tail,Michael Vogel,princess luna,"They are all too real, Snowfall, and your actions will allow them to return. The future of Equestria shall be bathed in a blanket of eternal snow!"
A Hearth's Warming Tail,Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,There's still time!
A Hearth's Warming Tail,Michael Vogel,rarity,"Oh, my."
A Hearth's Warming Tail,Michael Vogel,fluttershy,Snowfall Frost?
A Hearth's Warming Tail,Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,I was hoping I wasn't too late for the party? I brought gifts.
A Hearth's Warming Tail,Michael Vogel,rainbow dash,[spit-take] Boss?!
A Hearth's Warming Tail,Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,"I was wrong earlier, about Hearth's Warming Eve. It's not all about singing and presents. The singing and presents are all about celebrating the ponies in our lives. The ponies we should listen to more often: our friends."
A Hearth's Warming Tail,Michael Vogel,rainbow dash,Wow.
A Hearth's Warming Tail,Michael Vogel,rainbow dash,Dragon toenail? Uh... thanks?
A Hearth's Warming Tail,Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,I was in a hurry. I'll do better next time.
A Hearth's Warming Tail,Michael Vogel,rainbow dash,Ha. You kidding? No one's ever given me dragon toenail before! It's awesome! Now come get some eggnog!
A Hearth's Warming Tail,Michael Vogel,twilight sparkle,"[narrating] And from then on, it was always said of all the Hearth's Warming Eve celebrations, Snowfall's was the Hearth's Warmingest."
A Hearth's Warming Tail,Michael Vogel,twilight sparkle,The end.
A Hearth's Warming Tail,Michael Vogel,twilight sparkle,"Well, that's it! Thanks for letting me read you the story. Guess you can call it a night. Spike and I are heading downstairs, and if you wanted to, you'd be welcome to join us."
A Hearth's Warming Tail,Michael Vogel,twilight sparkle,"Welcome to the party! Happy Hearth's Warming, Starlight."
A Hearth's Warming Tail,Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,"Happy Hearth's Warming, Twilight."
A Hearth's Warming Tail,Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,Hearth's Warming Eve is filled with presents Some take you by surprise A story shared by your good friends That makes your spirits rise
A Hearth's Warming Tail,Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,"All together, feeling great"
A Hearth's Warming Tail,Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,Can hardly wait We'll party 'til late Our favorite date
The Saddle Row Review,Nick Confalone,rainbow dash,"[panting] Come on! If we hurry, we can get there before the paper's even delivered to Rarity's house!"
The Saddle Row Review,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,Maybe she won't read the article.
The Saddle Row Review,Nick Confalone,applejack,I'm pretty sure Rarity's gonna read a review of her new boutique in Manehattan.
The Saddle Row Review,Nick Confalone,rainbow dash,I still can't believe we all just blabbed everything that happened to that reporter!
The Saddle Row Review,Nick Confalone,fluttershy,I just hope it doesn't end up being an article about how her friends almost ruined the opening.
The Saddle Row Review,Nick Confalone,twilight sparkle,"I think you're all overreacting. Rarity's our friend. If anypony is gonna understand, it'll be her."
The Saddle Row Review,Nick Confalone,rarity,[grimly] I was wondering when all of you were going to show up.
The Saddle Row Review,Nick Confalone,rarity,[excitedly] Now we can all read the review together!
The Saddle Row Review,Nick Confalone,rainbow dash,"Um, I have an idea. How 'bout we don't read it?"
The Saddle Row Review,Nick Confalone,twilight sparkle,"What she means is, before you read it, we should probably tell you about<U+0097>"
The Saddle Row Review,Nick Confalone,rarity,"No, no, darling. Please, no spoilers."
The Saddle Row Review,Nick Confalone,fluttershy,But<U+0097>
The Saddle Row Review,Nick Confalone,rarity,No spoilers!
The Saddle Row Review,Nick Confalone,rarity,"Now, is everypony ready to hear what I'm sure is a stellar review that describes in stunning detail exactly how each of you contributed to the successful opening of Rarity For You?"
The Saddle Row Review,Nick Confalone,rarity,"[clears throat, reading] ""Many a pony has tried their hoof at joining the ranks of the elite fashion trendsetters currently ensconced in the boutiques of Manehattan's famed Saddle Row."" [giggles, continues reading] ""Some might say it's the ultimate achievement in Equestrian fashion, and never before has a reporter been granted such unfettered behind-the-scenes access until now!"""
The Saddle Row Review,Nick Confalone,fluttershy,I wish it had been more fettered.
The Saddle Row Review,Nick Confalone,rarity,"Oh, uh... [mutters] Ah! [reading] ""I sat down with..."" [giggles, continues reading] ""...Rarity and her friends after the opening to get the inside scoop, and what a scoop it was!"""
The Saddle Row Review,Nick Confalone,rarity,"Well, I was wondering<U+0097>"
The Saddle Row Review,Nick Confalone,rarity,"Well, I wouldn't say all over Equestria. I just have two other boutiques: one in my hometown of Ponyville, and one in Canterlot. Uh, still, when I decided to open this one, I was nothing but confident."
The Saddle Row Review,Nick Confalone,twilight sparkle,"Let's just say that if I could choose, I probably wouldn't do it that way again. Heh."
The Saddle Row Review,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,"Well, it wasn't the funnest party ever..."
The Saddle Row Review,Nick Confalone,applejack,"It was a plum-puckered, pig-pushin' disaster!"
The Saddle Row Review,Nick Confalone,rainbow dash,"After a lifetime of awesome, I think everypony's allowed to mess up every now and then, right?"
The Saddle Row Review,Nick Confalone,rainbow dash,"Wait, are you writing this down?"
The Saddle Row Review,Nick Confalone,fluttershy,"Um, it didn't go exactly how I thought it would, but it, um, started out all right."
The Saddle Row Review,Nick Confalone,rarity,"Welcome to Saddle Row, an entire street lined with the most fashionable boutiques in all of Equestria!"
The Saddle Row Review,Nick Confalone,applejack,"If it's supposed to be the most fashionable block of shops, where's Stinky Bottom's Discount Hat Emporium?"
The Saddle Row Review,Nick Confalone,rarity,I suppose it didn't make the cut. [gasps] Here it is! Rarity For You!
The Saddle Row Review,Nick Confalone,twilight sparkle,"Rarity, it's lovely. But are you sure you'll be ready to open tonight?"
The Saddle Row Review,Nick Confalone,rarity,"No need to fret over a mere moderate amount of preparation. My clothes arrive soon, my sales associate after that, and with a little... dusting, we'll be ready for the grand opening tonight."
The Saddle Row Review,Nick Confalone,rarity,"Mr. Stripes owns the building. He's a very pleasant landlord. Although he can be pushy at times. [beat] Okay, all the time."
The Saddle Row Review,Nick Confalone,rarity,"[chuckles nervously] It's just, I'm dreadfully busy preparing for tonight's grand opening, as you can see."
The Saddle Row Review,Nick Confalone,rarity,I'm sorry. I just don't think it's going to be possible.
The Saddle Row Review,Nick Confalone,rarity,"Oh, uh, welcome aboard."
The Saddle Row Review,Nick Confalone,rarity,Glow-in-the-dark teeth! What was she thinking?!
The Saddle Row Review,Nick Confalone,rarity,"Aah! Fluttershy, your assistance is required in the stock room, posthaste!"
The Saddle Row Review,Nick Confalone,fluttershy,"Aw, hello."
The Saddle Row Review,Nick Confalone,rarity,But what are they doing here?
The Saddle Row Review,Nick Confalone,fluttershy,"Smoky made too much noise eating garbage, so Softpad's mother made them move out of the trashcan."
The Saddle Row Review,Nick Confalone,fluttershy,"Then Smoky Jr. found a nice home in the crawl space behind the building. But Mr. Stripes demolished it, so they were temporarily camped out in the back until they found a new place to live."
The Saddle Row Review,Nick Confalone,rarity,"No, no, no! I can't have a family of rubbish-scented raccoons living in my boutique!"
The Saddle Row Review,Nick Confalone,rarity,"Uh, did you hear that?"
The Saddle Row Review,Nick Confalone,rarity,[annoyed] Heh. Turns out there's a Club Pony Party Palace upstairs.
The Saddle Row Review,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,[excitedly] Turns out there's a Club Pony Party Palace upstairs!
The Saddle Row Review,Nick Confalone,rarity,"I'm sorry. Could you please ask her to turn it down? Could you ask her to turn it down, please? [pleading] Turn it down, please! [sobbing] Oh, please!"
The Saddle Row Review,Nick Confalone,rarity,"Ugh! Foals today listen to their so-called ""music"" far too loud. I realize that makes me sound like an old mare. But this is business!"
The Saddle Row Review,Nick Confalone,rainbow dash,I wish we were having as much fun as they are.
The Saddle Row Review,Nick Confalone,twilight sparkle,"Well, sweeping can be fun, too. [to the beat] Sweep, sweep, sweep, sweep. Sweep, sweep, sweep, sweep, sweep..."
The Saddle Row Review,Nick Confalone,rainbow dash,"Only Twilight could make a dance remix about sweeping. I mean, how lame is that?"
The Saddle Row Review,Nick Confalone,applejack,Yeah. It wasn't even catchy.
The Saddle Row Review,Nick Confalone,rainbow dash,Nope.
The Saddle Row Review,Nick Confalone,twilight sparkle,"[to the beat] Sweep, sweep, sweep, sweep..."
The Saddle Row Review,Nick Confalone,rarity,"Apparently, DJ Pon-3 has a residency at the Party Palace upstairs, but security won't let me speak to her."
The Saddle Row Review,Nick Confalone,rarity,Aah! What in the name of Celestia was that?!
The Saddle Row Review,Nick Confalone,rarity,"[sighs] We'll have to do something about that, after I think of a way to quiet down that music. And after I finish designing the window display!"
The Saddle Row Review,Nick Confalone,rarity,"Gesundheit! Oh, Miss Pommel! I'm so glad to see you! Now, as the sole sales associate at Rarity For You, I hate to add to your already overflowing plate of responsibilities, but it looks as though we have just a tad more to do before tonight than I thought."
The Saddle Row Review,Nick Confalone,rarity,Oh? Why not?
The Saddle Row Review,Nick Confalone,rarity,"Feel better, my sweet. We'll manage without you... somehow. And we'll manage glowing teeth and car horns and disorganized clothes and dance music! Am I forgetting anything?"
The Saddle Row Review,Nick Confalone,rarity,[sobbing] What am I going to do?!
The Saddle Row Review,Nick Confalone,twilight sparkle,"Well, opening a store in Manehattan is a pretty big deal. It's natural that Rarity would be a little stressed about how it was going. Since it wasn't going well. Still, I think she handled it all right."
The Saddle Row Review,Nick Confalone,rarity,"My dream is doomed! Doomed, I tell you! Doomed!"
The Saddle Row Review,Nick Confalone,twilight sparkle,"I know things haven't gone perfectly so far, but we've done this kind of thing before. If we all work together<U+0097>"
The Saddle Row Review,Nick Confalone,rarity,"I appreciate the offer, but this is Manehattan. To make it in the fashion scene here, everything has to be perfect. The perfect location! The perfect clothes! The perfect opening!"
The Saddle Row Review,Nick Confalone,twilight sparkle,Maybe we should just postpone.
The Saddle Row Review,Nick Confalone,rarity,"Postpone?! Darling, tonight is the last night of the fall season. If we don't open tonight, it won't be..."
The Saddle Row Review,Nick Confalone,twilight sparkle,[sighs] Perfect.
The Saddle Row Review,Nick Confalone,rarity,"Yes. I know what needs to be done. I just need more of me! Oh, how I wish I could make copies of myself!"
The Saddle Row Review,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,"Yeah... Making copies of yourself always sounds like a great idea, but before you know it, you're locked in a room with fifty Pinkie Pies watching paint dry."
The Saddle Row Review,Nick Confalone,twilight sparkle,We can do this. And we can stay true to your vision.
The Saddle Row Review,Nick Confalone,rarity,"You'd do that? Fluttershy, you'll handle those... strong-smelling raccoons for me?"
The Saddle Row Review,Nick Confalone,fluttershy,Of course.
The Saddle Row Review,Nick Confalone,applejack,"Leave Plaid Stripes to me. I'll handle her and her, uh, ""good ideas""."
The Saddle Row Review,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,"Ooh, ooh, ooh! And I can go upstairs to that nonstop party and have tons of fun and eat some cake and set off party cannons and<U+0097>"
The Saddle Row Review,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,And then make them be quiet.
The Saddle Row Review,Nick Confalone,twilight sparkle,"I'm pretty sure I know somepony who wouldn't mind organizing this merchandise shipment for you. [beat] I'm talking about myself. [beat] [pleading] Oh, please, let me organize it!"
The Saddle Row Review,Nick Confalone,rarity,"This all sounds splendid, but I don't even have a single employee, and I'll need the best of the best."
The Saddle Row Review,Nick Confalone,rainbow dash,Leave the hiring to me.
The Saddle Row Review,Nick Confalone,rarity,"Oh! This is it, my dears. If you can handle these problems, I'll focus on the designs for the front window display. We'll show Manehattan what Rarity For You is all about! Oh, what would I do without you?"
The Saddle Row Review,Nick Confalone,rainbow dash,"What would she do without us? Huh. Lemme think. [imitating Rarity] ""Darlings, I'm absolutely doomed, doomed, doomed!"" [laughs, normal voice] Heh, I sound just like her!"
The Saddle Row Review,Nick Confalone,rainbow dash,"Hey, you're not writing this down, are you?"
The Saddle Row Review,Nick Confalone,rarity,Now for the perfect window display. Hmm.
The Saddle Row Review,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,"Oh, I can't really stop a super fun party in the middle of mega-happy fun times, can I?! Oh, what would Rarity want?!"
The Saddle Row Review,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,Really?
The Saddle Row Review,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,Oh! If you say so!
The Saddle Row Review,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,Oh.
The Saddle Row Review,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,"Obviously, DJ Pon-3 only plays the sickest of beats. I just wouldn't want her to miss out on the coolest new music straight from the back-alley underground, zip-zap party scene! [to DJ Pon-3] I'd play the whole thing if I were you, no matter what other ponies think."
The Saddle Row Review,Nick Confalone,rainbow dash,"Rarity For You is only hiring the best of the best. And to me, that means the fastest. Now, uh, before we begin, uh... [to herself] Am I doing this right? What would Rarity want? [to applicants] New plan!"
The Saddle Row Review,Nick Confalone,rainbow dash,Who can be the first one to tell me what fabric this is?
The Saddle Row Review,Nick Confalone,rainbow dash,Are you sure?
The Saddle Row Review,Nick Confalone,rainbow dash,I don't know the first thing about clothes. Pretty much all I can do is look at something and tell you if it's clothes or not. This chair? Not clothes.
The Saddle Row Review,Nick Confalone,applejack,"Uh, fabric?"
The Saddle Row Review,Nick Confalone,applejack,"Oh, no?"
The Saddle Row Review,Nick Confalone,applejack,"[sighs, to herself] What would Rarity want? [to Plaid Stripes] You know, I like you, Plaid Stripes. If it were up to me, we'd have a spoon clothes store right next to Stinky Bottom's Discount Hat Emporium. But it ain't up to me, so the answer is no."
The Saddle Row Review,Nick Confalone,applejack,"Personally, I think spoon clothes ain't such a bad idea. Useful, too. Eatin' soup, stirrin' gumbo, diggin' little holes."
The Saddle Row Review,Nick Confalone,twilight sparkle,"There. Perfect. Although, what would Rarity want? Maybe she wouldn't like it done by color. Guess I have to start over!"
The Saddle Row Review,Nick Confalone,rarity,"A window display is the first thing customers see, and if they like it, they'll walk inside and experience the glory that is my boutique."
The Saddle Row Review,Nick Confalone,rainbow dash,[stammers] I don't know which one of you to hire! Just... keep guessing fabrics!
The Saddle Row Review,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,"Oh, no! Not a shopping music mashup!"
The Saddle Row Review,Nick Confalone,fluttershy,"I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry!"
The Saddle Row Review,Nick Confalone,rarity,How's it<U+0097>
The Saddle Row Review,Nick Confalone,rarity,Ooh!
The Saddle Row Review,Nick Confalone,rarity,Hello? The door appears to be stuck!
The Saddle Row Review,Nick Confalone,twilight sparkle,Yep. We're workin' on it!
The Saddle Row Review,Nick Confalone,rarity,"Hmm. Well, shouldn't let this time go to waste."
The Saddle Row Review,Nick Confalone,twilight sparkle,How did this happen?
The Saddle Row Review,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,I shut down the party.
The Saddle Row Review,Nick Confalone,applejack,I told Plaid Stripes no.
The Saddle Row Review,Nick Confalone,fluttershy,I asked the raccoons to leave.
The Saddle Row Review,Nick Confalone,rainbow dash,I asked a lot of fabric questions.
The Saddle Row Review,Nick Confalone,twilight sparkle,Rarity asked us to help her with everything because she knows all of us so well. [to Fluttershy] She knows how much you care for animals. She'd trust you to solve the problem your way. [to the others] Maybe we should all do the same. Doing this our way is what Rarity wants. It's not too late. Let's all dig in and we can fix this.
The Saddle Row Review,Nick Confalone,twilight sparkle,Before Rarity finds out how bad we messed up.
The Saddle Row Review,Nick Confalone,fluttershy,I'm sorry I asked you to leave. The place is yours if you wanna stay. Though I would like to ask you all just one favor.

The Saddle Row Review,Nick Confalone,rainbow dash,"Okay, I don't get fabric, but I do get speed. And I need somepony fast enough to help all the customers Rarity's gonna have. So... first one to the river and back gets the job! [beat] It's a race! Go!"
The Saddle Row Review,Nick Confalone,applejack,"[clears throat] Mr. Stripes, I owe your daughter an apology. She's got good ideas, and I should give 'em a chance. So here's what I'm thinkin'."
The Saddle Row Review,Nick Confalone,rarity,Perfect!
The Saddle Row Review,Nick Confalone,twilight sparkle,"[awkwardly] Wow, looks like we fixed that door just in time!"
The Saddle Row Review,Nick Confalone,rarity,[gasps] Oh! What's all this?
The Saddle Row Review,Nick Confalone,twilight sparkle,"The whole place organized by style, cross-referenced by size, and reverse-indexed by fabric. She'll be able to find anything in three seconds flat! It was some of my best work."
The Saddle Row Review,Nick Confalone,rarity,Oh! I knew I could count on you! All right... I suppose this is the moment of truth...
The Saddle Row Review,Nick Confalone,rarity,Rarity For You is now open!
The Saddle Row Review,Nick Confalone,rarity,"Oh, dear. I wasn't quite prepared for such a crowd. How will I handle them all?"
The Saddle Row Review,Nick Confalone,rainbow dash,"Right this way, everypony, and one of our talented salesponies can help you out!"
The Saddle Row Review,Nick Confalone,rainbow dash,"Honestly, they were all pretty slow. But they finished the race. Plus they knew a lot more about fabric than I did. So, I hired them all!"
The Saddle Row Review,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,"The way I see it, Rarity designs fashion, DJ Pon-3 designs beats. What better combination than a boutique/dance club?"
The Saddle Row Review,Nick Confalone,fluttershy,"After a quick bath, they were more than willing to help!"

"Applejack's ""Day"" Off","Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox; story by Neal Dusedau, Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox",applejack,So everypony here wants a steam bath?
"Applejack's ""Day"" Off","Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox; story by Neal Dusedau, Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox",rarity,"Well, the solution is obvious. We'll simply have to start our short time at the spa with something else."
"Applejack's ""Day"" Off","Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox; story by Neal Dusedau, Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox",applejack,"[scoffs] Nothin' doin'. I came here to have a steam, and that's just what I'm gonna get!"
"Applejack's ""Day"" Off","Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox; story by Neal Dusedau, Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox",rarity,"But, but, it'll take most of our hour just to get through this line!"
"Applejack's ""Day"" Off","Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox; story by Neal Dusedau, Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox",rarity,"Well, I wish I could say the same."
"Applejack's ""Day"" Off","Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox; story by Neal Dusedau, Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox",applejack,Not without my steam!
"Applejack's ""Day"" Off","Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox; story by Neal Dusedau, Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox",rarity,"Apparently, Applejack won't consider starting her time at the spa without a steam, and we only have an hour."

"Applejack's ""Day"" Off","Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox; story by Neal Dusedau, Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox",applejack,"Um, why are y'all just standin' here?"
"Applejack's ""Day"" Off","Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox; story by Neal Dusedau, Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox",applejack,"So if you're not gettin' enough steam, that must mean there's not enough hot water."
"Applejack's ""Day"" Off","Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox; story by Neal Dusedau, Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox",rarity,"Ooh, Applejack, honestly, can't we just start with a hooficure? We're going to run out of time."

"Applejack's ""Day"" Off","Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox; story by Neal Dusedau, Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox",applejack,Ha! Now what do we have here?
"Applejack's ""Day"" Off","Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox; story by Neal Dusedau, Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox",rarity,"The laundry room, of course. And at this point, I'm considering soaking my hooves in one of the machines so my time here isn't a total loss!"

"Applejack's ""Day"" Off","Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox; story by Neal Dusedau, Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox",applejack,Looks to me like you don't have any left.
"Applejack's ""Day"" Off","Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox; story by Neal Dusedau, Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox",applejack,"I think I figured out the problem. You've got a small leak, and that means the steam takes just a little longer to build up. And while ponies wait, they get cold. Cold ponies start wrappin' themselves in towels, and all those dirty towels have to be cleaned because Ponyville Day Spa prides itself on cleanliness."
"Applejack's ""Day"" Off","Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox; story by Neal Dusedau, Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox",applejack,"Basically, losin' steam makes you use more towels. That means you do more laundry, which uses up the hot water you need to make more steam, so the problem just keeps gettin' worse."
"Applejack's ""Day"" Off","Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox; story by Neal Dusedau, Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox",rarity,"Wonderful. Now that we've solved the great steam mystery, we can finally get back to our... significantly less than an hour of relaxation."

"Applejack's ""Day"" Off","Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox; story by Neal Dusedau, Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox",rarity,Ahh!
"Applejack's ""Day"" Off","Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox; story by Neal Dusedau, Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox",applejack,"Whew! Now that that leak's fixed, ponies won't get so cold they use up all those towels! And without all that laundry, there'll be plenty of hot water for all the steam anypony could want!"
"Applejack's ""Day"" Off","Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox; story by Neal Dusedau, Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox",applejack,"[laughs] No, thanks. I'm just relieved I can finally relax in the steam. What do you say, Rarity?"
"Applejack's ""Day"" Off","Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox; story by Neal Dusedau, Michael P.

Honestly, how in Equestria did it never occur to you to check for leaks?"
"Applejack's ""Day"" Off","Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox; story by Neal Dusedau, Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox",rarity,You obviously need an outside eye to evaluate the situation. It's lucky for you Applejack is too stubborn to relax!
"Applejack's ""Day"" Off","Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox; story by Neal Dusedau, Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox",applejack,"Uh, I'm sorry, Rarity. We'll just have to do this another day. Twilight and Spike should be done feedin' the pigs by now."
"Applejack's ""Day"" Off","Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox; story by Neal Dusedau, Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox",rarity,Twilight is a very capable pony. I'm sure she can figure out what to do next.

"Applejack's ""Day"" Off","Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox; story by Neal Dusedau, Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox",rarity,"Of course. [gasps] Why don't we pop back so you could explain to Twilight what to do next, and then we'll come back here and pick up where we left off?"
"Applejack's ""Day"" Off","Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox; story by Neal Dusedau, Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox",applejack,"Well, I suppose I could try... assumin' everythin' went well so far."
"Applejack's ""Day"" Off","Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox; story by Neal Dusedau, Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox",rarity,"[laughing] Oh, Applejack, honestly! How could it not?"
"Applejack's ""Day"" Off","Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox; story by Neal Dusedau, Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox",spike,Wouldn't it be easier to just fly?
"Applejack's ""Day"" Off","Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox; story by Neal Dusedau, Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox",applejack,"I'm sorry, Rarity, but I think I'm gonna have to finish these chores myself."
"Applejack's ""Day"" Off","Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox; story by Neal Dusedau, Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox",rarity,"Twilight, darling! How in the world did you end up there?"
"Applejack's ""Day"" Off","Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox; story by Neal Dusedau, Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox",twilight sparkle,Spike and I were just trying to follow Applejack's list as closely as possible.
"Applejack's ""Day"" Off","Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox; story by Neal Dusedau, Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox",spike,Mmmh... Maybe not the best plan.
"Applejack's ""Day"" Off","Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox; story by Neal Dusedau, Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox",twilight sparkle,"I'm sorry, Applejack, but we never even got started feeding the pigs."
"Applejack's ""Day"" Off","Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox; story by Neal Dusedau, Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox",applejack,"That's alright, Twilight. I know you did your best. I guess a list can't really capture all the ways I have of doin' things."
"Applejack's ""Day"" Off","Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox; story by Neal Dusedau, Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox",twilight sparkle,At least you two got to spend some time at the spa together.
"Applejack's ""Day"" Off","Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox; story by Neal Dusedau, Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox",spike,"Yeah, that must've been super relaxing!"
"Applejack's ""Day"" Off","Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox; story by Neal Dusedau, Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox",rarity,"Well, if watching Applejack fix plumbing counts as relaxing, then yes."
"Applejack's ""Day"" Off","Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox; story by Neal Dusedau, Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox",twilight sparkle,What about your hour of spa perfection?
"Applejack's ""Day"" Off","Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox; story by Neal Dusedau, Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox",rarity,"As it turns out, the Ponyville Day Spa had a few problems with their steam room, and somepony refused to relax until she had fixed them."
"Applejack's ""Day"" Off","Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox; story by Neal Dusedau, Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox",applejack,"I'm sorry, but I just couldn't let those spa ponies go another minute puttin' up with problems they didn't even know they had! Somehow they just got used to a huge bottleneck of ponies standin' around waitin'. An' I took one good look at that spa jam, and I knew I had to do somethin'! Sometimes the simplest things can just derail a whole operation. [babbles] Whether it's a leaky pipe or doin' too much laundry. You can't just stick to the same old way of doin' things and expect them to get better. [clucking] I mean, thinkin' you can is just plumb ridiculous. Right? [short laugh] It's funny when you realize the extra work they were doin' was actually makin' things worse!"
"Applejack's ""Day"" Off","Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox; story by Neal Dusedau, Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox",applejack,"I mean, I guess it's possible to get stuck in a routine where you're doin' all this extra stuff and not realize it, but I can't for the life of me think of how! [beat] Why are y'all starin' at me like that?"
"Applejack's ""Day"" Off","Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox; story by Neal Dusedau, Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox",rarity,Um... Are you certain everything you just did is entirely necessary to feed the pigs?
"Applejack's ""Day"" Off","Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox; story by Neal Dusedau, Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox",applejack,"What? Of course! Why would I be doin' it if it weren't? See, this gate here used to squeak so loud, the pigs would run to the other side of the pen and never come out! So I open and close it to let them know it's safe."
"Applejack's ""Day"" Off","Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox; story by Neal Dusedau, Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox",twilight sparkle,But it doesn't squeak anymore.
"Applejack's ""Day"" Off","Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox; story by Neal Dusedau, Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox",applejack,Of course not! I fixed that ages ago. Then I realized puttin' a little fright into 'em got 'em all hustlin' out of the pen.
"Applejack's ""Day"" Off","Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox; story by Neal Dusedau, Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox",spike,They don't look scared to me.
"Applejack's ""Day"" Off","Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox; story by Neal Dusedau, Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox",applejack,"Well, no. They got used to it. Which is why I started doin' the chicken dance! To show 'em that if they didn't get to eatin' their food, the chickens would. 'Course, bein' a chicken, I couldn't very well open the gate. Gettin' the food bucket to spill into the trough was just a happy accident because one time I left it there by mistake."
"Applejack's ""Day"" Off","Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox; story by Neal Dusedau, Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox",twilight sparkle,"Uh, Applejack? It seems like everything you're doing is to fix things that aren't really problems anymore."

"Applejack's ""Day"" Off","Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox; story by Neal Dusedau, Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox",rarity,Hmmm... Maybe it isn't so hard to get stuck doing extra work after all.

Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,I'm so glad you asked.
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,"And it was super awesome of you to invite me too! Things have been so busy with the Wonderbolts lately, it's great to get a chance to relax someplace quiet."
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,"Oh, no! Not again!"
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,"Wait, you don't mean<U+0097>!"
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,zephyr breeze,"Guess who's home! That's right, big sis, it's your one and only favorite little brother, moi."
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,zephyr breeze,"Hi, Flutterbutter! How's the bestest big sister ever? Hey, where's the love? How about a little excitement to see your baby brother?"
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,"I'm just surprised. When you left, you said mane therapy was your calling."
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,zephyr breeze,"Oh, it is, sis, it is. You would not believe how much stress ponies hold in their manes. Everything gets limp and unmanageable. No offense, but brushing alone won't solve the problem."
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,What went wrong?
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,zephyr breeze,"Nothing went wrong, per se. It's just the powers that be were so locked into their required styles, and you know me. I've got my own style! And I think they were a little threatened."
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,Ugh.
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,zephyr breeze,"Welllll, if it ain't Rainbows ""The Best Flyer There Ever Was"" Dash!"
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,"[flatly] Oh, this ought to be good."
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,zephyr breeze,"Sorry, I shouldn't tease you. I know the whole super awesome flyer bit's just to impress me."
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,zephyr breeze,"Still, thanks for showing up for my homecoming. It's, it's sweet."
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,zephyr breeze,"I kinda thought there'd be more ponies here. I mean, what about your party planner friend, um... Sprinkle Pie! She could've turned this into a real house partay, am I right? I mean, this place could use it. [singsong] Drab!"
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,zephyr breeze,"Dad, please. When I get all my stuff back in here, you won't even remember what this boring old place looked like!"
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,"[whispering] Um, Mom, Dad, can I talk to you for a second?"
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,"I'm not so sure letting Zephyr move back home is a good idea. I know you both want to help, but don't you remember last time?"
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,[sighs] I know. It just seems like his place always ends up being your place. And then he sort of makes you do everything for him!
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,zephyr breeze,"And they were all like, ""We love your free spirit, Zeph! And it would be wrong to cage that! Go follow your dreams!"""
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,Zeph was just telling me all about the ins and outs of mane therapy school.
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,zephyr breeze,It's all so political. I just could not take it!
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,"Well, maybe if you stuck with it for more than a few weeks..."
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,zephyr breeze,"Sorry, sis, but when something's not the right fit, this pony's gotta fly!"
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,zephyr breeze,"[yawns] Anyway, good talk, Rainbows. I am so touched you came to see me, really. I hate to deprive you of my presence, but this breeze needs his Z's."
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,"You know it's the middle of the day, right?"
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,zephyr breeze,"I know. [maracas in background] Siesta! I'm just gonna assume you made up my room the way I like it, right, Mom? Oh, I almost forgot! All my stuff is out front. Wanna grab that for me, Pops? [short laugh] Thanks."
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,[sighs] Same old Zeph.
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,"I know you weren't expecting to see your brother, but you've been kind of quiet, even for you."
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,"I'm sorry, but I am just so... so... peeved right now! [gasps] Excuse my language!"
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,"Rainbow Dash! Fluttershy! It's me, Pinkie Pie! Your friend!"
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,"Oh, um, sorry about that."
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,"We just had lunch with Fluttershy's parents, and you'll never guess who showed up."
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,Ooh! Mayor Mare? Cranky Doodle Donkey? Cheese Sandwich? Ms. Harshwhinny?!
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,Zephyr Breeze.
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,"Oh, that makes more sense."
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,applejack,"And from the look on your face, I'm guessin' it's for another one of his ""extended stays""?"
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,She's a bit peeved.
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,"Zephyr's my brother, and I love him. But he's never learned to do anything for himself. I don't know why my parents keep letting him trot all over them!"
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,applejack,"Well, if your parents won't stand up for themselves, maybe you need to stand up for them."
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,"You know, you're right!"
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,Zephyr Breeze!
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,zephyr breeze,"Oh, hey, sis. Come to see me work my magic and turn this place from drab to fab, huh? Well, watch and learn!"
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,Can't you see what you're doing?!
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,zephyr breeze,Yeah! I'm getting rid of this old stuff so I can turn the backhouse into my art studio! I've decided I'm gonna be a sculptor!
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,I'm talking about Mom's flowers!
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,zephyr breeze,"She's gonna move them so I can have my meditation patio here. She loves replanting stuff. Don't you, Mom?"
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,And Dad's been collecting his favorite bits of cloud from the factory since before you were born.
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,You can't just fly in and change everything Mom and Dad have built here.
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,zephyr breeze,But this is the only place big enough for my studio/meditation garden. Ooh! Unless I do it in the living room!
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,"[to her parents] I know speaking up for yourself can be hard, believe me, but Zephyr will never stand on his own if he can lean on you."
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,zephyr breeze,"Don't be so dramatic, sis! Mom and Dad just wanna let me be me! Right? I can do plenty on my own."
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,I agree. Which is why you should move out.
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,zephyr breeze,"Oh. Well... I mean, I-I totally would, but... I don't think that's what Mom and Dad want! It's not, is it?"
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,zephyr breeze,"[tearing up] Sure. I mean, I really just came back here to keep you guys company, but... whatever's best for the family. I just... I just gotta grab a few essentials."
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,zephyr breeze,Of course! There's plenty of ponies who'd love for a little breeze to blow their way...
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,So... where's Zeph gonna go now?
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,"I'm not sure. Oh, I hope I did the right thing..."
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,Are you kidding? One hundred percent!
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,zephyr breeze,"[singsong] Hey, sis!"
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,zephyr breeze,Your new roomie's here!
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,"Okay, maybe like seventy percent."
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,"Um, Zephyr. When Mom and Dad told you to find someplace else to live, I don't think they meant here."
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,zephyr breeze,"Well, it's not their house, so by definition, it's someplace else. Am I right, Rainbows? Stop oogling me and help settle this."
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,[sighs] You know what? I totally forgot that I promised to help Pinkie Pie... sprinkle... something.
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,You said you had plenty of places to go!
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,zephyr breeze,Ehhhh...
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,[sighs] Fine. You can stay here<U+0097>
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,zephyr breeze,You're the best! We're gonna have so much fun.
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,On one condition.
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,zephyr breeze,Totally. Anything.
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,You have to get a job.
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,zephyr breeze,"Cracking the whip, huh? You always were kind of bossy."
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,[through gritted teeth] Zephyr Breeze...
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,zephyr breeze,Kidding! Get a job. Absolutely.
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,zephyr breeze,[yawns] Where are we goin' so early? You have no idea how bad morning sun is for your mane.
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,Remember how we talked about you getting a job?
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,zephyr breeze,"It was just yesterday, and it's totally on my to-do list, but you can't expect to find something befitting my awesomeness overnight."
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,I thought you might say that.
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,So I did it for you.
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,zephyr breeze,What?!
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,rarity,These fabrics all need to be dyed those colors. Do you think you can handle that?
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,zephyr breeze,"[muttering] Um, I don't know..."
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,rarity,You get started while Fluttershy and I head to the store for more supplies. Ta-ta!
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,Good luck!
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,Thanks for giving my brother a job. I just hope he's up to the task.
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"Oh, darling, dyeing fabric is the simplest thing!"
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,rarity,You just dip cloth in a bo<U+0097>
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,zephyr breeze,"[humming to himself] Rarity, you're back!"
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,What did you do?
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,zephyr breeze,"Since you talk to animals all the time, I just figured it runs in the family, so why not outsource this stuff, you know?"
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,zephyr breeze,Turns out the animal communication thing isn't genetic.
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"Zephyr, I asked you to do this job! Not to pawn it off on innocent woodland creatures!"
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,zephyr breeze,"Okay, I guess you have some feelings about this. But you should know it's basically your cat's fault for walking by and giving me the idea. But I'm actually kinda into this look!"
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,zephyr breeze,So I guess what I'm saying is... you're welcome?
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"[frustrated stuttering] Zephyr, this is just unacceptable!"
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,zephyr breeze,Wow. I guess I know when my efforts aren't appreciated.
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,rarity,Ugghh!
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,zephyr breeze,Whoa! Those are tall!
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"I'm glad you noticed, because they're your new job."
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,zephyr breeze,Wha? [to Fluttershy] You said you were taking me to tea with the princess!
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,"Actually, I said I was going to tea with the princess. You're going to work."
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,zephyr breeze,"Sis, c'mon!"
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"Don't worry, Zephyr, it'll be easy. I just need a Pegasus pony to fly up and wipe each window down from top to bottom."
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,spike,And I'm here to make sure you do it right.
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"Wow, Zephyr! This looks amazing!"
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,zephyr breeze,"Uh, you know, like you said, it was easy!"
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,Where's Spike?
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,spike,Up here!
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"You were supposed to supervise, not do all the work!"
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,spike,"I was supervising! And then Zephyr asked me about different cleaning techniques and which one was best, and if I could<U+0097> Hey! I did all the work!"
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,zephyr breeze,Don't let him fool you. Old Spike is quite the taskmaster.
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,zephyr breeze,"Oh, come on, sis. I had to ask Spike to make sure I was doing it right."
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,"You didn't do it at all! [inhales] Well, I guarantee there won't be any fooling around on the next job."
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,zephyr breeze,Next job?
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,"That's right, Zeph! You're coming with me!"
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,zephyr breeze,"You don't have to come up with some excuse to hang out with me, Rainbows! Let's just go for a fly and see where the day takes us."
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,"[frustrated sigh] We're going to Wonderbolts Headquarters. And I am gonna give you a job so simple and straightforward, not even you can weasel your way out of it! [quickly] And the second you try, I'm gonna zap you with a storm cloud! Got it?!"
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,zephyr breeze,"Oh, I got it. I can already feel the electricity between us."
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,zephyr breeze,"Rainbow Dash is crazy, okay?! She expects me to do stuff right when she asks me to do it! It's insane!"
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,So you just quit? Again?
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,zephyr breeze,"Escaped is more like it. Besides, what was I supposed to do?"
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,"Keep trying? Finish something for once? Maybe that way, you'd actually find something you like to do!"
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,zephyr breeze,"That all sounds fine for your friends, but it's just not me."
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,"Then I'm sorry, Zephyr, but I don't think you can live here."
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,zephyr breeze,Fine! I'll just go live in the woods like my foreponies before me! Guess the only breeze this zephyr can count on is his own!
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,"Aw, cheer up, Fluttershy. I know it was hard, but you did the right thing. You couldn't let Zephyr pull the same stuff on you that he's always pulled on your folks!"
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,I guess so...
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,"Oh, hello, Constance!"
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,"Oh? Oh, dear."
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,zephyr breeze,"See, Wigford? The Breeze needs nopony! We've got food, shelter. Just need to put the old kettle on..."
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,zephyr breeze,"Come on, sticky-sticky, make with the sparks!"
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,zephyr breeze,Ugh! What's a pony got to do to find a decent stick around here?!
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,"I know he needs to learn to do things for himself, but..."
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,Oh... I can't let him live like this.
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,"Actually, I don't think he'd make it through the night."
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,zephyr breeze,"[gasps] Fluttershy! Hey! I was just, um, cozying up in my sleeping bag! Ready to call it an early night! [mock-tired] Such an exhausting day, y'know?"
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,It's noon.
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,zephyr breeze,You know me! [maracas in background] Siesta...
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,zephyr breeze,Ugh... I can't do this. I can't do anything.
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,"Zephyr, you're smart and talented. You could do anything if you just tried!"
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,zephyr breeze,"And what if I give everything I have and still fail? Honestly, I think it's better not to try at all."
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,But then you won't ever do anything.
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,zephyr breeze,"I don't expect you two to understand. I mean, when have you ever failed? You've literally helped save Equestria, like, a dozen times."
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,"And I was worried that I'd fail every time! Sometimes you have to do things, even though you might fail."
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,zephyr breeze,But failing is the worst!
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,"And quitting doesn't feel much better, does it?"
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,zephyr breeze,No.
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,"So here's the deal: You can come back with me, but you have to do exactly what I say. No exceptions."
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,zephyr breeze,[resigned] I will literally do anything you ask me if it means I don't have to stay here.
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,"Okay, you know what you have to do, right?"
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,zephyr breeze,"Beg for help, then quit when I get frustrated. Just kidding! Total opposite of that. Got it."
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,You think he can do it?
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,Everypony has times in their lives When their hearts are filled with doubt
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,zephyr breeze,Frustration builds up inside And it makes you want to shout
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,But if you just take that first step The next one will appear
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,zephyr breeze,There are times when you want to give up When you think that you can't go on
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,Everypony has times in their lives When their hearts are filled with doubt
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,But if you just give it your all You'll start to work it out
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,zephyr breeze,"And I know I can't give up too soon Get myself in the zone And I find I can walk, then run"
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,zephyr breeze,I can do it on my own
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,zephyr breeze,I can do it on my own I can do it on my own
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,zephyr breeze,I did it! I actually finished something! By myself!
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,And it looks exactly like it's supposed to.
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,"I knew you could do it, Zephyr."
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,zephyr breeze,"I didn't! But I do now. Thanks for believing in me, sis."
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,That's what big sisters are for.
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,"So, Zeph, now that you've accomplished this, what's next?"
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,zephyr breeze,"Anything I want! I mean, the sky's the limit, right?"
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,zephyr breeze,"But, y'know... I've got some baby steps in mind."
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,"Thanks for dinner, Mr. and Mrs. Shy! Ha! It was great as usual."
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,Huh...?
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,Have you heard from Zephyr? Is he doing well?
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,Heh. That's great.
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,zephyr breeze,[singsong] Guess who graduated from mane therapy training?
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,"Hah, awesome!"
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,"I'm so proud of you, Zephyr."
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,zephyr breeze,"It was only a matter of time before they recognized my true genius! But actually doing the work probably helped, and I wouldn't have if it weren't for you."
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,"Oh, I just gave you some encouragement. You did this on your own."
Flutter Brutter,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy,zephyr breeze,"And honestly, right now I feel like I can do anything... except find a place. I can still crash here for a few days, right?"
Spice Up Your Life,Michael Vogel,twilight sparkle,"As you've all probably noticed, it's been quite some time since the map has sent us on a mission of friendship."
Spice Up Your Life,Michael Vogel,spike,Yeah! Ever since Starlight messed with it to go back in time and try to change history!
Spice Up Your Life,Michael Vogel,twilight sparkle,"Yes. Since then. But, as part of her studies, Starlight's been assisting me. And together, we think we've come up with a spell that can get it working again!"
Spice Up Your Life,Michael Vogel,pinkie pie,"[simultaneously] Ooh, well done!"
Spice Up Your Life,Michael Vogel,twilight sparkle,Now without further ado...
Spice Up Your Life,Michael Vogel,pinkie pie,"Fluttershy and Twilight in Appleloosa! No, me and Rainbow Dash in Las Pegasus! No, Rainbow Dash and Twilight in Yakyakistan! No, Twilight and Twilight in Twilight's castle! Oh. Me! Me! Oh, me... and Rarity! Ooh! I hope it's some faraway place that nopony has gone before!"
Spice Up Your Life,Michael Vogel,rarity,"[chuckles nervously] Well, maybe not too far away. An adventure somewhere that has modern conveniences would be preferable. [gasps] Canterlot! This is wonderful! I can check the boutique! Perhaps there'll be some social events that we can attend! [gasps] I'll have to pack extra outfits! What will I wear?!"
Spice Up Your Life,Michael Vogel,pinkie pie,"Y'know, some ponies get excited about the silliest things."
Spice Up Your Life,Michael Vogel,rarity,"[sighs] Now then, as far as finding a friendship problem, I suggest we start at the castle and begin to question the proper<U+0097>"
Spice Up Your Life,Michael Vogel,pinkie pie,"Oh, Rarity, you don't find a friendship problem. It finds you. We just need to go with the flow, and eventually, kablam! We get friendship problem'd right between the eyes."
Spice Up Your Life,Michael Vogel,rarity,"Well, this is a team effort, so if you feel we should go with the flow, then with the flow we shall go. But where's the flow saying we should go?"
Spice Up Your Life,Michael Vogel,pinkie pie,You know Canterlot. What do you think we should do?
Spice Up Your Life,Michael Vogel,rarity,"Hm. Take your pick. Culture, couture, cuisine!"
Spice Up Your Life,Michael Vogel,rarity,"Oh, my. Well, it sounds like your stomach is saying we should flow towards some lunch? I know just where to go."
Spice Up Your Life,Michael Vogel,rarity,"Restaurant Row, the absolute best place for fine dining in all of Equestria!"
Spice Up Your Life,Michael Vogel,pinkie pie,"Ooh, so many choices! Where should we go? This one? That one? Those ones?"
Spice Up Your Life,Michael Vogel,rarity,Any establishments that have this <U+0096> the three-hoof rating.
Spice Up Your Life,Michael Vogel,pinkie pie,"Um, whose hooves?"
Spice Up Your Life,Michael Vogel,rarity,"Why, Zesty Gourmand, the Queen of Cuisine. When it comes to food, she is the ultimate authority in Canterlot and thus all Equestria. She judges a restaurant on cuisine, decor, and presentation. Without her approval, a restaurant simply cannot survive."
Spice Up Your Life,Michael Vogel,pinkie pie,What's so important about her approval?
Spice Up Your Life,Michael Vogel,rarity,"Zesty grew up around fine dining, and everypony hangs on her every word when it comes to cuisine."
Spice Up Your Life,Michael Vogel,rarity,"[gasps] Oh, my! Such presentation. Mm. Oh. [smacks lips] Ah. Yes. Very nice..."
Spice Up Your Life,Michael Vogel,pinkie pie,"Nom nom nom. [gulps, gags] Maybe, I'm not in the mood for... [whispers] whatever this is. Can we try someplace else?"
Spice Up Your Life,Michael Vogel,pinkie pie,Nom nom. Ugh. Maybe one more stop?
Spice Up Your Life,Michael Vogel,pinkie pie,Blech! Nope.
Spice Up Your Life,Michael Vogel,pinkie pie,"Maybe instead of trusting somepony else's hooves, I should pick the next place?"
Spice Up Your Life,Michael Vogel,rarity,Ugh! Very well.
Spice Up Your Life,Michael Vogel,rarity,The Tasty Treat. It's very... rustic. [whispers] It looks like it hasn't even been rated.
Spice Up Your Life,Michael Vogel,pinkie pie,Thank goodness! Hee-hee!
Spice Up Your Life,Michael Vogel,rarity,Are we sure they're open?
Spice Up Your Life,Michael Vogel,pinkie pie,[sniffs deeply] Mmmm. It smells open.
Spice Up Your Life,Michael Vogel,pinkie pie,"Yes, indeedy!"
Spice Up Your Life,Michael Vogel,rarity,We're actually in a bit of a hur<U+0097>
Spice Up Your Life,Michael Vogel,pinkie pie,"Yes, please!"
Spice Up Your Life,Michael Vogel,pinkie pie,We'll take one!
Spice Up Your Life,Michael Vogel,pinkie pie,How can you say no to that?
Spice Up Your Life,Michael Vogel,rarity,"Oh, me? Oh, I'm fine. Thank you. [aside, singsong, to Pinkie] No rating."
Spice Up Your Life,Michael Vogel,pinkie pie,Hiya! What's your name?
Spice Up Your Life,Michael Vogel,pinkie pie,Are you a chef here too?
Spice Up Your Life,Michael Vogel,pinkie pie,Then why are you stacking chairs?
Spice Up Your Life,Michael Vogel,pinkie pie,[slurps] So good!
Spice Up Your Life,Michael Vogel,rarity,"Um, Pinkie, perhaps we should excuse ourselves."
Spice Up Your Life,Michael Vogel,pinkie pie,"[muffled speaking] Oh, Rarity, try this!"
Spice Up Your Life,Michael Vogel,rarity,[munches] Ooh!
Spice Up Your Life,Michael Vogel,pinkie pie,"[spits] Rarity, I think that friendship problem just kablammed us right between the eyes!"
Spice Up Your Life,Michael Vogel,rarity,"These two? Oh, I don't know, darling. The food is excellent, but I'm not sure there's much you and I can do to help them."
Spice Up Your Life,Michael Vogel,rarity,That's it!
Spice Up Your Life,Michael Vogel,pinkie pie,"Yes! Uh, what's it?"
Spice Up Your Life,Michael Vogel,rarity,The flow has led us here! This is our mission! [to Saffron and Coriander] We are going to get you a three-hoof rating and save your restaurant! I can get Zesty Gourmand here!
Spice Up Your Life,Michael Vogel,pinkie pie,[gasps] And I can pack this place with ponies!
Spice Up Your Life,Michael Vogel,pinkie pie,You really don't know Rarity.
Spice Up Your Life,Michael Vogel,rarity,[singsong] I've done it!
Spice Up Your Life,Michael Vogel,pinkie pie,See?
Spice Up Your Life,Michael Vogel,rarity,"It took all of my charm and cajoling, but I was able to convince Zesty Gourmand to come and try the food!"
Spice Up Your Life,Michael Vogel,rarity,"Ah, yes. Well, um, there is a bit of a challenge. The only time she could make herself available is tonight."
Spice Up Your Life,Michael Vogel,rarity,"Zesty rates a restaurant on cuisine, decor, and presentation, and she has very specific tastes. If she's coming tonight, there is quite a bit of work that needs to get done."
Spice Up Your Life,Michael Vogel,pinkie pie,Like what?
Spice Up Your Life,Michael Vogel,rarity,"Oh, a tweak here, a tuck there, some slight modifications to the menu. [laughs nervously] We just need the place to feel more cosmopolitan."
Spice Up Your Life,Michael Vogel,rarity,Why don't I stay behind with Coriander to get the restaurant ready for Zesty's arrival? You and Saffron can try and drum up some business.
Spice Up Your Life,Michael Vogel,pinkie pie,"One packed restaurant, coming right up!"
Spice Up Your Life,Michael Vogel,rarity,"Coriander, I understand your trepidation. But I promise you, we will get those hooves by making this place feel just like all of the other restaurants on Restaurant Row!"
Spice Up Your Life,Michael Vogel,pinkie pie,It'll be fine. Rarity's gonna make sure that The Tasty Treat is the most unique and beautiful restaurant in Canterlot! Not like all of those stuffy places on Restaurant Row.
Spice Up Your Life,Michael Vogel,rarity,"Here' If you want to succeed You must follow the trends, that's the key"
Spice Up Your Life,Michael Vogel,pinkie pie,Here' Your food is so good The flavor's so fancy and free
Spice Up Your Life,Michael Vogel,rarity,"You need to change If you want to compete But fear not, for I know what to do"
Spice Up Your Life,Michael Vogel,pinkie pie,Don't ever change Being different is good Don't let what others do be your cue
Spice Up Your Life,Michael Vogel,pinkie pie,Be unique
Spice Up Your Life,Michael Vogel,rarity,Just be the same
Spice Up Your Life,Michael Vogel,pinkie pie,Trust your heart
Spice Up Your Life,Michael Vogel,rarity,You'll make your name
Spice Up Your Life,Michael Vogel,pinkie pie,Try harder! Fillies and gentlecolts! Check out the super stupendous and amazing cuisine of The Tasty Treat! Grand re-opening tonight!
Spice Up Your Life,Michael Vogel,pinkie pie,Rrrgh! Stupid hooves!
Spice Up Your Life,Michael Vogel,pinkie pie,"Yes! Yes, it is!"
Spice Up Your Life,Michael Vogel,rarity,[sighs] This is going to be exactly what Zesty is looking for!
Spice Up Your Life,Michael Vogel,pinkie pie,"Rarity, what did you do?"
Spice Up Your Life,Michael Vogel,rarity,I know. Isn't it perfect? Zesty is sure to love it.
Spice Up Your Life,Michael Vogel,pinkie pie,I thought we were trying to make this the most unique and beautiful restaurant in Canterlot! Not make it exactly like every other restaurant!
Spice Up Your Life,Michael Vogel,rarity,[short laugh] We want to help our friends by getting them three hooves. That will only happen if this is like every other restaurant.
Spice Up Your Life,Michael Vogel,pinkie pie,Not that! Anything but that!
Spice Up Your Life,Michael Vogel,pinkie pie,"Rarity, how could you ruin the restaurant?!"
Spice Up Your Life,Michael Vogel,rarity,"Oh, pff. Kch. Ts! We helped save the restaurant. Now, where are the other guests? How many other ponies are coming?"
Spice Up Your Life,Michael Vogel,rarity,Just two?! I thought you said you could pack the place with ponies no matter what!
Spice Up Your Life,Michael Vogel,pinkie pie,You said you would make the restaurant better...
Spice Up Your Life,Michael Vogel,pinkie pie,...so I guess we both didn't know what we were talking about!
Spice Up Your Life,Michael Vogel,rarity,"[gasps] Zesty Gourmand! Everypony, places!"
Spice Up Your Life,Michael Vogel,rarity,"No-no-n-n-no, but that's not what Zesty wants!"
Spice Up Your Life,Michael Vogel,pinkie pie,What kind of food expert doesn't want flavor?! That's insane!
Spice Up Your Life,Michael Vogel,pinkie pie,I'm taking this out there!
Spice Up Your Life,Michael Vogel,rarity,No! Zesty will hate it! You are going to ruin this for them!
Spice Up Your Life,Michael Vogel,pinkie pie,"No, I'm trying to fix it after you ruined it!"
Spice Up Your Life,Michael Vogel,rarity,Zesty! Please wait! Allow me to explain!
Spice Up Your Life,Michael Vogel,pinkie pie,Disreputable?! You mean a place with food that actually tastes good?
Spice Up Your Life,Michael Vogel,pinkie pie,I'm so embarrassed.
Spice Up Your Life,Michael Vogel,rarity,I don't know that there are words to adequately express how truly sorry we are.
Spice Up Your Life,Michael Vogel,rarity,"Oh, my! This is truly delightful!"
Spice Up Your Life,Michael Vogel,pinkie pie,"Mmm, this is the best thing you've made so far! And I thought the food before was the best!"
Spice Up Your Life,Michael Vogel,rarity,You know what? Who cares what some stuffy unicorn thinks of the food here? It's exquisite.
Spice Up Your Life,Michael Vogel,pinkie pie,That's true.
Spice Up Your Life,Michael Vogel,rarity,And you don't need three silly hooves in your window to prove it.
Spice Up Your Life,Michael Vogel,pinkie pie,That's double true!
Spice Up Your Life,Michael Vogel,rarity,You just need ponies in here to give it a chance! Ponies that will tell everypony else in Canterlot that The Tasty Treat has the best food in the city!
Spice Up Your Life,Michael Vogel,pinkie pie,That's true times three!
Spice Up Your Life,Michael Vogel,rarity,"Ohhhh, yes, they will. Pinkie, we are the perfect team for this! We were just doing the wrong jobs! I will go out and bring the crowd! You stay here and make sure this place is every bit as unique and rustic as it was the moment we walked in!"
Spice Up Your Life,Michael Vogel,rarity,"You two? You are going to cook! Make whatever you want, and make a lot of it! I intend to bring a crowd!"
Spice Up Your Life,Michael Vogel,rarity,Would the owner of one of the premier boutiques in Canterlot put a stamp of approval on something that wasn't fabulous?
Spice Up Your Life,Michael Vogel,rarity,It's almost time! Is everypony ready for the grand re-re-opening?
Spice Up Your Life,Michael Vogel,pinkie pie,"Oh, you guys! Group hug!"
Spice Up Your Life,Michael Vogel,pinkie pie,Now come on! We've got a party to throw!
Spice Up Your Life,Michael Vogel,rarity,"No, we can't, and neither can you! Nopony has the right to tell these ponies what to think! Zesty, you have very... specific..."
Spice Up Your Life,Michael Vogel,pinkie pie,And very strange!
Spice Up Your Life,Michael Vogel,rarity,"Yes, and very strange opinions about food, and that's your right. But just because you like your food a certain way, there is no reason to tell these ponies that they need to do the same!"
Spice Up Your Life,Michael Vogel,rarity,"Zesty, are you sure you wouldn't like to try the food? Ignoring a unique and fresh establishment such as this could do serious damage to your social standing."
Spice Up Your Life,Michael Vogel,pinkie pie,Nothing can stop the dynamic duo of Pinkie and Rarity!
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,daring do,Whoa! [gasping] Oof!
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,rainbow dash,"Well, don't stop there! You read, I pack! That's the deal!"
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,twilight sparkle,"I'm sorry, Rainbow Dash. I just keep thinking about how much fun you're gonna have at the Daring Do convention. I wish Princess Celestia didn't need my help with the friendship summit in Griffonstone."
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,rainbow dash,Don't worry. I'll make sure A. K. Yearling signs your book. I can't believe she's gonna be there! She never goes to conventions!
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,rainbow dash,"Which, I guess, will be cool for all those other fanponies. But since you and I know A. K. Yearling personally, [hushed] and we know that she's secretly Daring Do herself, [normal] it's no big deal. This convention will be fun, but it's nothing to get too excited about."
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,rainbow dash,So excited!
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,rainbow dash,No thanks. Did that already. Ahhh.
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,rainbow dash,This is the...
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,quibble pants,Now this is something that only a true fan can appreciate.
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,rainbow dash,They even put the tiles in the right order.
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,quibble pants,"Huh. Good catch. Oh, I'm Quibble Pants. Nice to meet you."
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,rainbow dash,Rainbow Dash.
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,rainbow dash,Nice costume.
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,quibble pants,"You, too."
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,rainbow dash,Thanks. The hard part was figuring out the right...
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,quibble pants,"B-B-Because on page 84 of Sapphire Stone, i-it describes her dodging a, quote, ""score of arrows shooting forth from holes in the very walls,"" unquote, but then on page 107, Daring Do says she, quote, ""barely made it past the traps' barrage of arrows,"" unquote, but clearly, Daring Do is embellishing and the correct number of arrows is..."
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,rainbow dash,"[sighs] I am so glad I ran into you. Even though I knew the convention would be totally awesome, it's more fun when you're with someone who really knows Daring Do."
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,quibble pants,I know what you mean. It's so hard to find a pony who really gets it.
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,rainbow dash,"Hm. That's weird. We've only done stuff from the first trilogy. After lunch, we should probably start working our way back through the other books."
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,quibble pants,"Whoa, whoa, whoa. There are no other books."
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,rainbow dash,"Of course there are. Daring Do and the Trek of the Terrifying Towers, Daring Do and the Many Faces of<U+0097>"
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,quibble pants,"Uh, p-please, please don't. Just don't even mention the titles. I-I'm not saying those books don't exist. I'm saying that I refuse to acknowledge them."
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,rainbow dash,Why?
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,quibble pants,"'Cause they're horrible! I mean, there isn't a single thing after Ring of Destiny that is even remotely in the realm of the possible!"
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,rainbow dash,What?! I know for a fact that everything in every one of those books is one hundred percent possible!
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,quibble pants,"Uh, and how could you possibly know that?"
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,rainbow dash,"Gyuh, uh, I just... do!"
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,quibble pants,"Well, that's a compelling argument."
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,rainbow dash,Why would you even come to this convention if you hate Daring Do so much?
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,quibble pants,"I don't hate Daring Do. The first series was smart and cool and an amazing nod to old-time serialized adventure books, that somehow manages to be self-reflective and ironic while at the same time celebrating the art form without a hint of cynicism. Which is why I came here to ask A. K. Yearling muzzle-to-muzzle why she sold out and dumbed down the rest of her books into just a series of impossible action sequences!"
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,rainbow dash,"Okay, now I know you're crazy. A. K. Yearling is awesome, and every Daring Do book that comes out is better than the last!"
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,quibble pants,"Wha... Wow. Okay, yeah, I-I-I'm sorry, but I could never be friends with somepony who's willing to believe impossible stuff is possible as long as Daring Do does it."
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,rainbow dash,"That's okay, because I could never be friends with somepony who's so focused on things being possible that he's willing to turn his back on the coolest hero of all time!"
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,quibble pants,Fine!
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,rainbow dash,Fine!
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,rainbow dash,"Look, just tell A. K. Yearling that Rainbow Dash is here, and I need her help to convince a know-it-all pony that everything Daring Do's ever done actually happened!"
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,rainbow dash,A. K.! I gotta talk to you. It's an emergency!
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,rainbow dash,What? No. But there is a pony downstairs who thinks everything you've written after the first trilogy is totally unrealistic and terrible. And I need you to help me prove to him that it's all totally possible.
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,rainbow dash,Whoa!
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,rainbow dash,Yes! Sounds like another awesome Daring Do adventure! But... what are you doing here?
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,daring do,...I can just blend in with all the Daring Do cosplayers.
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,rainbow dash,How can I help?
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,daring do,Just keep your eyes out for anything suspicious.
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,rainbow dash,Got it!
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,rainbow dash,Does a pony who only likes your first trilogy qualify as suspicious?
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,rainbow dash,"Heh, just checking."
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,dr. caballeron,"Dr. [sighs] I find all this fanfare around my archenemy... disturbing. [to salespony] I mean, where is the booth for Caballeron?"
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,dr. caballeron,"Dr. I do not see the likeness. Come, let us find Daring Do and the Amulet of Culiacan. I don't want to spend any more time in this place than I have to!"
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,quibble pants,"Well, if it isn't the pony who know impossible things can happen because she just does!"
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,rainbow dash,"Ugh! Sorry, Quibble, I've got more important things to do than argue with a pony who thinks awesome means unrealistic."
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,quibble pants,"No, wait! I want to hear more about how you're one hundred percent sure that in Curse of the Jungle Queen, Daring Do could survive a sixty-story drop from the top of a waterfall after sustaining a broken wing in a category-six rapid!"
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,rainbow dash,"Ugh! Obviously, her wing wasn't broke<U+0097> Caballeron!"
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,quibble pants,"See, now that's a great character. Solid backstory, good motivations..."
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,rainbow dash,No-no-no-no! Caballeron is right there!
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,quibble pants,"Of course he is. He's also over there, over there... Ooh, ooh, over there, and and over there. Where are you going?"
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,quibble pants,And we're out here because...?
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,rainbow dash,"Daring Do told me that Caballeron came to this convention to steal the Amulet of Culiacan, and I just saw him and his henchponies come this way!"
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,quibble pants,Okay. I'm gonna head back inside. There's just a little too much crazy out here for the both of us.
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,dr. caballeron,"Dr. I do not know what Daring Do is playing at, but if she told you two fanponies of my plan to steal the amulet, you must work for her."
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,rainbow dash,"Caballeron! Hah! What do you have to say now, Quibble?"
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,quibble pants,"This was your plan to prove the Daring Do books are realistic? You bought a Daring Do Experience Adventu-cation, really?"
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,rainbow dash,"What?! No! Look around us! Henchponies, Caballeron, the jungle it took forever to get to? This is the real deal!"
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,quibble pants,Right. We're actually being held captive by Caballeron. Please! This guy's accent is all over the place! No offense.
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,dr. caballeron,Dr. I...
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,quibble pants,"So what's the setup here? You've... kidnapped us, and taken us to the middle of nowhere because...?"
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,dr. caballeron,"Dr. The Temple of Chicomoztoc is somewhere in this jungle. When I find it, the Seven-Sided Chest is as good as mine! I just need the Amulet of Culiacan to unlock it."
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,quibble pants,"Uh-huh, and Daring Do has the amulet so you came up with this over-complicated plot to lure her into the jungle and exchange it for us."
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,dr. caballeron,"Dr. I wouldn't call it over-complicated, but... yes."
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,quibble pants,"Okay, we're done here. Great work. Seriously, very believable."
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,quibble pants,"[grunts] Listen, pal, you can keep her money, but I'm not<U+0097>"
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,dr. caballeron,"Dr. Going anywhere! You may not approve of my plan, but I'm the mastermind here!"
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,quibble pants,[aside] Debatable...
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,dr. caballeron,"Dr. And I say you will remain here until Daring Do comes to rescue you. And if she wants you back in one piece, she will give me the amulet! Tie them up!"
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,rainbow dash,The Griffon's Lock!
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,dr. caballeron,Dr. You know of it? Further proof that you are an agent of Daring Do!
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,quibble pants,Or an avid reader.
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,quibble pants,"Listen, if I pretend to believe this nonsense is real, will you call off the henchpony repertory theater over there?"
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,rainbow dash,They're not gonna listen to me. They abducted us both.
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,quibble pants,[unconvincingly] Daring Do. Thank goodness. We're over here.
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,quibble pants,"[laughing] All four?! I mean, shouldn't at least one of them stay behind to guard us? Oh, oh, wait, the... No, because then it wouldn't be a terrible Daring Do adventure."
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,rainbow dash,It doesn't matter. We'll never solve the Griffon's Lock before they get back.
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,rainbow dash,"Okay, that was pretty good. Quick, we've gotta get out of here and warn Daring Do!"
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,quibble pants,No way. Just point me to the hotel and you can play fanpony and hunt treasure out here all day long.
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,rainbow dash,"[sighs] Fine. Let's just say this is a Daring Do Adventucation. The only way to get back to the convention is to go through it. So just follow me, and I'll lead you out. Deal?"
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,quibble pants,I... [groans] Fine.
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,rainbow dash,"[under her breath] Maybe if I just leave you in the jungle, it'll convince you."
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,quibble pants,"...which would make Daring Do left-hoofed, which we know is false, and that is everything that's wrong with Daring Do and the Trek to the Terrifying Tower. Now, the problems with the next book are even<U+0097> Oh, right. What Daring Do adventure would be complete without the precarious rope bridge?"
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,quibble pants,"Look, I'm all for making things feel as real as possible, but are these Adventu-cation ponies sure this thing is safe?"
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,rainbow dash,"Is it too ""realistic"" for you? Wouldn't want that on a Daring Do adventure, would we?"
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,quibble pants,"If this were really a real Daring Do adventure, I'm sure I'd step on the wrong plank at exactly the wrong<U+0097>"
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,quibble pants,Whoa!
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,quibble pants,[sighs] Good thing this is all just a pretend adventure. Least we know all of this struggling won't make the bridge fall apart.
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,quibble pants,You need to get your money back.
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,rainbow dash,Hah! How's that for not possible?
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,quibble pants,"That was... awesome! I-I-I thought we... and then you, and the flying...! Wow, and I was like, ""Where are you going?!"" A-a-and then you swerved, and I was, I was, I was on the water, and then [devolves into hyperventilating gibberish] Wow!"
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,rainbow dash,"Yeah. If you read that in a book, you might even think it was unrealistic."
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,quibble pants,"Okay, I'll give you that one. I mean we could have been done for. [beat] We could have been done for! W-What kind of Adventu-cation is this?! I mean, that's just, that's just bad business! What, what are these ponies thinking?!"
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,dr. caballeron,Dr. Make sure they are secure this time! We can't have them escaping again.
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,rainbow dash,[straining] You'll never get away with this!
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,dr. caballeron,"Dr. Won't I? You've led me to the temple, and Daring Do is too noble to let harm befall her companions, so the amulet is as good as mine. What? No witty remarks this time about how silly my plan is?"
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,quibble pants,"This isn't the official Daring Do Experience Adventu-cation, is it."
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,rainbow dash,Finally!
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,quibble pants,It's some cheap knockoff run by a bunch of incompetent ponies that have no idea how to execute this adventure with any level of safety!
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,rainbow dash,Ugh!
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,quibble pants,"What was that with the bridge?! We were in serious danger! I-I'm reporting you all to... well, I don't know who I'm reporting you to, but it's gonna be somepony important! Oh, and this cut-rate excuse for an ""Experience"" hasn't proved anything except that I'm right! It has all the hallmarks of a lame Daring Do adventure!"
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,rainbow dash,Uh... Quibble?
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,quibble pants,"No, I'm talking! Generic jungle location <U+0096> check. Overly complicated villain plot <U+0096> check. Random coincidences that conveniently get us to the next big set piece <U+0096> check!"
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,dr. caballeron,"Dr. Watch where you are stepping, you fool!"
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,quibble pants,"Listen, buddy, I don't take orders from some second-rate performer who learned acting from the Supervillain School of Bad Accents! The only thing this mess is missing is some giant Ahuizotl wannabe monster, and I have a feeling that would be a bit too much for you bargain-basement adventurers to pull off!"
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,quibble pants,Huh?
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,quibble pants,Um... you're real. This is real. This is real!
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,daring do,"I told you to warn me of anything suspicious, not run off on an adventure without me!"
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,quibble pants,"Wha... Whoa, whoa, y-you're real! You-you-you're friends with her?"
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,daring do,"Uh, we'll have to do introductions later. Right now we have to<U+0097>"
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,quibble pants,"G-Get out of here, yes! Thank you!"
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,daring do,"Actually, no."
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,quibble pants,What?!
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,daring do,We can't leave without the treasure. And we should probably get to it before our friend gets any higher.
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,rainbow dash,Whoa!
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,daring do,"Seven doors, seven locks. One of them leads to the treasure. I'd rather not think about what the others lead to."
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,quibble pants,"Yeah, yeah, the classic ""Pony and the Tiger"" bit. All you have to do is<U+0097>"
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,rainbow dash,"Um, maybe you should let Daring Do figure it out?"
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,quibble pants,"Oh, 'scuse me."
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,quibble pants,[coughs] Not that one.
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,quibble pants,Ehhhhh...
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,daring do,Is he always like this?
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,rainbow dash,Yeah. But... he's usually right.
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,daring do,[sighs] Which lock do you think it is?
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,quibble pants,"Ugh, finally. Look, each door has another door that matches. These two both have Earth ponies fighting serpents. These two have Pegasi fighting griffons. These two have unicorns fighting bears. But this one..."
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,daring do,...has an Alicorn on it! It's the only one without a match! How did I miss that?
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,quibble pants,I've been asking myself that ever since book four!
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,quibble pants,The Seven-Sided Chest of Chicomoztoc!
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,quibble pants,"Uh, guys...?"
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,rainbow dash,Uh... The way out is totally covered! How are we gonna get out of here?!
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,daring do,There!
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,quibble pants,"Seriously, do you ever not escape out of the top of a temple?!"
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,daring do,We'll have to carry Mr. Adventure Critic out with us!
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,rainbow dash,We won't be fast enough! We'll never make it!
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,quibble pants,Guys! I think Rainbow Dash and I have this covered.
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,quibble pants,Go around! You can't go over him!
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,daring do,Go over him?! Are you crazy?!
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,rainbow dash,"If Quibble says go over him, we go over him!"
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,quibble pants,You two are insane!
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,rainbow dash,You said go over him!
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,quibble pants,I said go around him!
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,daring do,[hushed] And I said be quiet!
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,dr. caballeron,Dr. This way! I heard them!
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,quibble pants,"[hushed] Okay, I got it. Let's create a fake treasure out of mud and rocks, give that to Caballeron, and then we<U+0097>"
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,daring do,[hushed] Not every Daring Do plan has to be super-complicated.
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,dr. caballeron,Dr. Rrrgh! I swear I heard them!
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,dr. caballeron,"Dr. I'll get you, Daring Dooooo!"
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,quibble pants,"Meh. Not particularly original or inspired, but it worked."
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,daring do,Who were you again?
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,rainbow dash,He's a fan.
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,daring do,[unconvinced] Uh-huh. [normal] There's some stairs on the other side of the temple that lead out of the ravine. I suggest you two take them and head west.
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,rainbow dash,What about you?
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,daring do,I've gotta get this to a museum. Thanks for your help. I couldn't have done it without you. Both of you.
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,rainbow dash,So...?
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,quibble pants,So... maybe the later books are slightly more realistic than I gave them credit for. Still don't like them.
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,rainbow dash,What?! How can you<U+0097>?!
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,quibble pants,"Wait, hold on. Before we get in another fight, I-I think I finally figured it out! I love the Daring Do that solves puzzles and uses her brain to get out of tough situations, and she did way more of that in the original trilogy! You love the Daring Do that is brave and awesome and comes out on top no matter what the odds!"
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,rainbow dash,Okay...?
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,quibble pants,"And that's okay! We might never agree on what makes Daring Do cool, but you... are definitely cool. I-I mean, the way you saved me on the bridge? Wow! And escaping from the temple... you, Rainbow Dash, are awesome."
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,rainbow dash,"Well... I-I'm not the one who can locate a treasure in half the time Daring Do can! You may have terrible taste in books, but you're pretty awesome yourself. In a brainy, egghead, puzzle-solving kind of way. Heh."
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,quibble pants,I guess we don't have to agree on everything to get along. Friends?
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,rainbow dash,Definitely friends.
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,quibble pants,"Uh, do you think A. K. Yearling would consider letting me write the next book? I... I think I can make things way clearer. I mean, for instance, in the second adventure..."
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,quibble pants,"...there's a side character. I don't want to kind of name it right now, because it's sort of this thing that I've already written a lot of fan fiction on. I don't want you to... Not that I'm saying that you would steal it! But I am saying this would totally go along my whole thing about puzzle-solving, except what if each puzzle that was solved, uh, unlocked a new karate move? Think of it that way, right? And I mean I'm kind of a ""Yearlite"" myself, so I'm sure she'd be open to<U+0097>"
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,rainbow dash,Uh... Quibble?
Stranger Than Fan Fiction,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,quibble pants,Sorry!
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,cheerilee,"Good morning, everypony! I hope you brought your thinking caps, because today we're going to learn about physics!"
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,scootaloo,Physics?
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,cheerilee,"Mm-hmm! Specifically, the use of force in energy conversions! In this case, using mechanical work to convert potential energy into kinetic energy!"
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,apple bloom,The what now?
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,sweetie belle,"Um, Miss Cheerilee? That sounds a bit over our heads."
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,scootaloo,Yeah. Why would we even need to know that stuff?
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,cheerilee,"Oh, it's very important. In fact, you'll most likely end up using it tomorrow."
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,apple bloom,Tomorrow? What for?
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,cheerilee,"Why, for participating in the... Applewood Derby!"
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,snails,"Oh, phew! For a second, I thought we were gonna have to, you know, learn stuff."
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,scootaloo,We get to race in the Applewood Derby tomorrow? That's so cool!
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,apple bloom,"My family's talked about it for years, and now I'm finally old enough to race!"
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,cheerilee,"Now hold on to your horseshoes, everypony. You've got a lot of work to do before you're ready to race."
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,snips,"Yeah, but... not schoolwork, right?"
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,cheerilee,"There'll be a block of applewood just like this one waiting for you at Sweet Apple Acres tomorrow, and you've got one day to turn it into a race-ready cart."
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,scootaloo,"Oh, yeah... That is a lot of work."
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,cheerilee,"Mm-hmm. Luckily, you'll each get to pick an older pony to help you! But choose wisely, because they'll also have to ride in the cart with you during the race."
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,scootaloo,Hmmm... I think I know just the pony to ask.
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,sweetie belle,Me too!
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,apple bloom,Me three!
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,cheerilee,"Just remember, everypony. Your cart has to be able to finish the race if you want to win one of the awards. Fastest <U+0096> for winning the race, naturally. Most traditional <U+0096> for the best working replica of an original Applewood cart. And most creative <U+0096> for the cart with the best overall design."
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,apple bloom,[dreamily] Hoo-wee! Those ribbons are the bees' knees.
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,cheerilee,"All right then, class! You've got a lot to learn if you want to build a race cart."
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,snips,Aww... I knew there was gonna be a catch!
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,sweetie belle,Wow! Have you seen what the carts used to look like in the olden days?
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,apple bloom,"Yeah, I know all about them. When Ponyville started the Derby, they decided to use the wood from our apple trees for the carts. The race has been a part of Sweet Apple Acres ever since."
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,sweetie belle,"I just think these old carts look so cool! But I guess you and Applejack will probably win the award for the most traditional, huh?"
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,apple bloom,"The Apples usually do, but honestly, I'd rather build the fastest cart there is and win the race!"
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,apple bloom,But... I'm pretty sure Scoot and Rainbow Dash'll take that award.
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,scootaloo,"You know, I race around so much on my scooter, being the fastest isn't such a big deal. Maybe I'll try to make the wildest looking cart I can think of!"
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,apple bloom,Really?
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,scootaloo,"Sure! If I win most creative, you can totally win the award for fastest!"
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,sweetie belle,And I can win the award for most traditional!
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,apple bloom,Sounds like we're all gonna try somethin' different. I can't wait to tell Applejack!
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,scootaloo,Let's get to it!
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,cutie mark crusaders,"Go, Crusaders!"
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,rainbow dash,Are you kidding?! Of course I'll help with the Applewood Derby! I want you to have as much fun as I did when I was a filly!
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,scootaloo,"Wait, Cloudsdale has a derby too?"
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,rainbow dash,Sure! Practically every town in Equestria has one! [sighs] I still remember racing my cloud cart...
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,young rainbow dash,This is so awesome! Woo-hoooooo!
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,scootaloo,And lemme guess. You won fastest cart.
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,rainbow dash,"Heh, obviously!"
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,scootaloo,So what do you say? Will you help me make my race cart?
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,rainbow dash,Help you? I'm all over it! I've got tons of ideas.
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,scootaloo,"Don't worry, I've got a lot of<U+0097> Whoa. Ideas of my own. Um..."
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,scootaloo,What are you looking for?
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,rainbow dash,"The blueprint for my derby cart, of course! I'll have to change it a little, 'cause this race is on roads, not on clouds. But trust me, your cart is gonna be amazing!"
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,scootaloo,"Um, okay, Rainbow Dash, thanks! How awesome is this? With Dash on my team, how could anything go wrong?"
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,applejack,"Well, I'm mighty flattered you wanna work with your big sis on your cart. I mean, the Applewood Derby did<U+0097>"
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,apple bloom,<U+0097>start on our farm. I know.
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,applejack,"Well, I couldn't be more proud to help my little sister take the prize for most traditional."
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,apple bloom,"Actually, I was kinda thinking of somethin' else. Like... fastest?"
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,applejack,"[scoffs] Fastest? Apple Bloom, things aren't like they were in the old days. The fastest cart now has gotta be slick and modern and<U+0097>"
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,apple bloom,Exactly!
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,applejack,"Not Apple at all. The Apples win most traditional. We have since the Derby started! Why would anypony want to win anythin' else? Now why don't you head off and get some chamomile vines, some hickory sticks, and some apple barrels, and I'll show you what an Apple family cart should look like!"
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,apple bloom,I guess I do have a family tradition to uphold...
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,rarity,[gasps] The Applewood Derby?! [excited giggling] Of course I'll help!
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,sweetie belle,"Wow. Uh, Rarity, I didn't know you'd be this excited."
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,rarity,"Me? Oh, why, I'm just itching to right an old wrong from long, long ago!"
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,rarity,"[narrating] I designed my own cart when I was just a filly, and I was positive I was going to win the prize for most creative, hooves down! But I came in second. Second!"
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,sweetie belle,You? Second in most creative? To whom?!
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,rarity,[narrating] But I learned a valuable lesson.
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,rarity,"I learned to know my audience, and the race cart audience wants big! They want bold!"
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,rarity,Chop chop! Everypony out!
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,rarity,We've got work to do!
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,rarity,...but I will fashion the biggest and boldest Derby cart to ever win the prize for most creative!
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,sweetie belle,"Actually, I was sorta thinking of something more... traditional?"
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,rarity,"Oh! [tittering] Please, darling, leave tradition to the Apples. We're doing big, we're doing bold! [humming to self] Soon the prize for most creative will finally be in my hooves!"
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,sweetie belle,You mean my hooves.
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,rarity,"Yes, that's what I said <U+0096> my hooves. Darling, I hope you're ready to get an early start tomorrow!"
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,sweetie belle,Uh... how early?
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,sweetie belle,"[yawns] [groans] Rarity, the sun's not even up yet."
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,applejack,"Oh, apples, quit complainin'! In my day, we were up even earlier!"
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,rainbow dash,"Hey, I'd get up in the middle of the night if it means my cart crosses that finish line first and wins fastest!"
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,rarity,And my cart wins most creative!
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,applejack,"And my cart wins most traditional! Hoo-wee, it's gonna be a good day!"
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,scootaloo,"You mean our carts, right?"
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,rarity,"Yes, that's what we said, darling."
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,applejack,Yup.
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,rainbow dash,Our carts.
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,apple bloom,Their carts? It almost sounds like they're planning on building them without us.
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,sweetie belle,"I'm sure they meant ""our"" carts. Like, the team cart, right?"
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,scootaloo,"Of course! I mean, they're all our older sisters. Practically. Plus, they've all done this before. I'm sure they know best. Let's just buckle down and get to work!"
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,rainbow dash,"Scootaloo, where have you been? I've only got 'til noon to make the fastest cart ever!"
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,scootaloo,"Uh, about that. I was really thinking of going for the most creative prize. I mean, I know all about speed already, so..."
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,rainbow dash,"Exactly! It's all about speed! You've gotta get across the finish line to win a prize, so we might as well get there first, right? Hey, I left a bunch of paint cans by the road. Bring them up here, would ya? Nothing as fun as painting racing stripes on the winning cart!"
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,scootaloo,[sighs] Right... Fun...
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,apple bloom,"Spendin' time buildin' a cart with my big sister? Why, this is just tee-riffic! Um... how can I help?"
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,applejack,"You can feast your eyes on... this! I-I mean, it ain't quite finished yet."
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,apple bloom,"Oh, good."
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,applejack,"But don't it have the makin's of the best cart you ever did see? Uh... is somethin' wrong, Apple Bloom?"
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,apple bloom,"Actually, I was kinda thinkin' of somethin' a little more modern. And less rickety. With maybe a chance of winning?"
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,apple bloom,"I'm an Apple, but... what if I just take off this fringe?"
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,applejack,"No, not the fringe!"
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,applejack,"Ugh! Why, shoot! Now I've gotta start all over from scratch, and it's almost race time!"
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,apple bloom,"Oh. So, maybe we can redesign it then? Just a little."
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,applejack,No time! And who'd want to redesign somethin' that's already perfect?
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,apple bloom,Right... Perfect...
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,sweetie belle,"Okay, so I sketched out some of my ideas."
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,sweetie belle,How about a nice yellow fringe on top?
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,rarity,"[muffled] Oh-ho-ho-ho, darling, [normal] the fringe is not exactly big! And that yellow is the least bold color I can imagine!"
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,sweetie belle,"Well, it doesn't have to be yellow. But I really do love the old-timey style. Like this."
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,rarity,"Sweetie Belle, precious face, ""old-timey"" is just another word for pass<e9>. Remember, big and bold! I do have a reputation to uphold! It was one thing to lose as a filly, but can you imagine if I didn't win the most creative now? Ponies might stop buying my couture!"
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,sweetie belle,But we're supposed to be doing this together!
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,sweetie belle,[sighs] Right... Wonderful...
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,apple bloom,"[tired] Hey, Crusader... How's it goin'?"
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,sweetie belle,"[sighs] Rarity's definitely made the biggest, boldest cart anypony's ever seen."
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,apple bloom,"Wow. Well, Applejack's built somethin' so traditional, it's practically an antique."
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,scootaloo,"[sighs] No matter what I say, there's no talking Rainbow Dash out of making the fastest cart in Equestria."
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,sweetie belle,Doesn't look like any of us ended up with what we wanted.
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,apple bloom,But... I'm sure our older sisters know what they're doin'. Right?
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,scootaloo,Right...
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,sweetie belle,Right.
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,apple bloom,"And even if our carts aren't exactly what we had in mind, it'll still be fun to drive them to the finish line."
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,sweetie belle,Sure! The race is the best part!
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,apple bloom,Yeah! CMCs behind the wheels!

The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,rarity,"You, too, Sweetie Belle. There's only one seat left aboard this creative masterpiece, and it's just for you. Woo-hoo!"
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,applejack,"Whoa, ponies! Wait for me! This traditional cart handles at the exact perfect pace <U+0096> slow! And I got the passenger seat all warmed up for ya, Apple Bloom!"
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,apple bloom,Passenger seat?!
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,scootaloo,[grunts] They're the only older ponies driving!
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,sweetie belle,"First they built the carts, now they're gonna drive them?!"
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,apple bloom,"I know they were all excited to help, but I don't think they're really helping anymore."
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,scootaloo,We better hurry if we wanna be a part of this race at all!
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,cheerilee,"Um, aren't you all missing somepony?"
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,applejack,They'll be along.
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,cheerilee,"And, uh, [hushed] usually the younger ponies drive the carts."
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,rarity,"[chuckles] Darling, do these look like usual carts to you?"
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,cheerilee,"[blows fanfare] Racers! On your marks, get set, go!"
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,apple bloom,[scream turns into a grunt] Can't we go any faster?!
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,applejack,Faster? Don't be silly. This is perfect!

The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,applejack,"My cart's the most traditional Just plain, no complications"
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,rainbow dash,"Look at me, I am the ace Might as well give up the chase"
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,cutie mark crusaders,Wish we could stop this race Start again and do it our way
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,scootaloo,Having any fun yet?
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,apple bloom,Nope! Maybe if we could go a little faster!
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,rarity,Gotta get some attention If I want that ribbon
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,rainbow dash,Gotta push the limit further Blow away the competition
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,applejack,"Gotta coast on through Just relax, we're gonna cruise it"

The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,cutie mark crusaders,They're not your carts!
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,apple bloom,We were supposed to design them!
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,scootaloo,And we were supposed to drive them!
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,sweetie belle,"The Derby was supposed to be for us, not the three of you! Now you've ruined it for everypony!"
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,rarity,Mmmh...
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,rarity,"Yes, well, I suppose we might have gotten a teensy bit carried away..."
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,applejack,But I thought you all wanted our help.
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,apple bloom,We did! We wanted your help to build our carts. But we all ended up with carts that are what each of you wanted!
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,rainbow dash,But why didn't you say anything?
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,scootaloo,You've all done the race before. I just figured you knew best!
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,sweetie belle,Plus it's hard to speak up to older ponies.
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,rarity,"Oh, I certainly understand that. But you mustn't think older ponies automatically know best."
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,rainbow dash,And we probably could have done a better job of listening to you.
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,applejack,Oof. I guess we owe all three of you an apology.
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,apple bloom,Maybe not just us.
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,rainbow dash,"[nervous laugh] Um, how do you feel about a do-over?"
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,cheerilee,I think that's a wonderful idea! But maybe the older ponies should sit this one out.
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,scootaloo,"Thanks for helping us fix up our carts. Pretty creative, right?"
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,apple bloom,"I know it's not traditional, but it sure looks fast, don't it?"
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,rarity,"You know, darling, I can't believe I'm saying this, but that yellow fringe is rather bold after all."
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,sweetie belle,"Thanks, everypony. We couldn't have done it without you."
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,applejack,"Yup, I sure am glad Miss Cheerilee agreed to run the race over again."
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,cheerilee,"Well, it isn't every year I get to say this twice, but... Derby racers to the starting line! Derby racers to the starting line! Racers! On your marks, get set... go!"
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,rainbow dash,And it's probably best keeping all the grown-ups on the sidelines. But... what are we supposed to do now?
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,rarity,I think I have an idea.
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,rarity,"[sipping through straw] Ahhh! Much better! Honestly, I'm not sure why we wanted to race those carts in the first place."
The Cart Before the Ponies,Ed Valentine; story by Ed Valentine and Michael Vogel,rainbow dash,Seriously! [sighs] This is the most relaxed I've been all day.
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,I'm so sorry I lost track of time at our picnic. I didn't mean for us to get caught out here after dark. But there's really nothing to be afraid of. The forest at night is the same as the forest during the day.
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,Only... darker.
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,"Still, maybe we should hurry back to the cottage."
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,Nothing to worry about. No reason to...
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,Ruuuun!
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,[hyperventilating] That wasn't funny! You really scared me! I hope you're happy.
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,Nope. You're too easy. You're scared of everything.
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,That's not true.
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,Boo.
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,"I mean, how could you not appreciate that?"
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,Because I don't think being scared is very fun!
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,"I do! Your heart gets all racy, your hooves get all tingly, your mouth gets all dry-ie! Actually, I don't like that part. But the rest is great!"
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,See? Everypony likes a good prank! They're just jokes!
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"Now, Rainbow Dash, I don't think Fluttershy would have called us all here to talk about this if she thought it was funny. Everypony has things they like and things they don't."
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,applejack,And scarin' Fluttershy is just lazy.
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,[scoffs] Lazy?!
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,A prank isn't very good if you're the only pony laughing.
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,"But what if it's really, really, really, really, really funny?"
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,And I can do funny.
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,I know you can. I guess the trick is making sure that your idea of funny matches the pony you're pranking.
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,That way<U+0097>
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,"Good one, Rainbow! Ha-ha! You have to admit! That was funny!"
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Not really.
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,applejack,Yeah. A whoopee cushion is like a joke shortcut.
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"Honestly, Rainbow Dash, if you are not willing to put forth the effort required to pull a prank that everypony can enjoy, you may as well not pull one at all."
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,"Fine! If you ponies want effort, then that's just what you'll get."
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,I'm not sure she understood what we meant.
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"I know you're excited about the Filly Guide Cookie Drive, but I still have to do a few finishing touches on your uniform."
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,sweetie belle,[lips smacking] Hmm. Not bad.
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"Huh. [reading] ""You asked for it."""
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,sweetie belle,What does it mean?
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"Hmm. I assume this is Dash's idea of a prank, which can only mean she's rigged some kind of booby trap to your Filly Guide uniform up there."
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,sweetie belle,So how do we get it down?
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"We don't. If Dash thinks I'm going to fall for whatever she's got in mind, she's got another thing coming. There's more uniforms where that one came from!"
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,sweetie belle,Hmm. The sewing machine cake is actually better than the cake cake.
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,rarity,Rainbow Dash!
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,[laughs] Gotcha! Ha-ha! How's that for effort?
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,"What's all this, Applejack? I thought you were gonna help me get ready for the Filly Guide Cookie Drive."
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,applejack,"Uh, yeah, sorry about that. But Rainbow Dash has been on a prankin' tear, and you can never be too careful."
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,Do you really think Dash is gonna try and prank you in your sleep?
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,applejack,Not if I have anythin' to say about it.
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,applejack,"See ya in the mornin', sugarcube."
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,applejack,Huh?!
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,applejack,Whoa!
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,Ha! Still think I'm lazy? Gotcha! [laughing] Pigpen...
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,applejack,[grunts] Ugh! Rainbow Dash!
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,[laughs] Gotcha!
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,Gotcha!
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,Gotcha!
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,Gotcha!
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Pinkie! We need your help.
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,Okay! For what?
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,rarity,Are you honestly going to stand there and tell us you know nothing about all the pranking Rainbow Dash has been doing?
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,"Oh, no! She's been pranking up a storm!"
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,"Did she get you, too?"
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,"[laughs] Oh, yeah! She and Gummy both!"
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,Boo!
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,They got me good.
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,applejack,"Well, she needs to stop."
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,Stop? But pranks are so much fun!
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Not for everypony. And it doesn't seem like Dash is taking the time to find out who enjoys them and who doesn't.
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"Uh, since you and Dash share such an, uh, affinity for pranking, we thought you might be able to get her to, um, uh... quit it!"
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,"Hey, Rainbow Dash! I have something very important to tell you!"
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,"Pinkie, hey! I actually have something totally important to tell you!"
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,You do? Ooh! You go first!
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,"Okay, you know how I've been pranking everypony?"
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,"Yeah! [giggles] It's been pretty funny! I-I-I mean, actually, that's what I have to talk to you about."
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,Here. Have a cookie.
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,"So, I got to thinking <U+0096> why waste my time pranking everypony one at a time when I could prank everypony at once?"
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,"Mmm, wow! Everypony at once?! That sounds amazing!"
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,"Gah, wait! I mean, it's not."
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,"You don't even know what it is yet! Pinkie, this is gonna be the best prank ever! I special ordered these joke cookies so the colors would match my mane."
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,And?
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,"And I'm gonna switch them with the Filly Guide cookies. When Scootaloo and her friends sell them, everypony in town's gonna get a rainbow mouth courtesy of Rainbow Dash! Ha-ha! It's gonna be so awesome!"
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,"Uh, I don't know. I mean, it doesn't really seem all that funny."
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,[gasps] What?!
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,Maybe this is a good time to stop pranking for a while. The other ponies in town really<U+0097>
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,"Stop?! No way! This prank is happening, Pinkie! And it's gonna be hilarious!"
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,"Pinkie, what's the deal? I told you I needed your help switching out all the Filly Guide cookies for the joke cookies. But when you didn't show, I had to do it all by myself! Uh, Pinkie?"
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,[chuckles] Wow. Your face is still pretty rainbowed.
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,"Yeah, I haven't really [coughs] been feeling well. And these joke cookies are the only thing that makes me feel better. You don't have any more, do you?!"
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,"Uh, no. I just told you, I used them all for the prank."
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,Oh.
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,"Pretty soon, the CMCs will start selling them to everypony in town. Ponies will open their boxes and start eating, then all of their teeth will turn rainbow-colored, and they'll know it was me! It's gonna be so awesome! C'mon, you don't wanna miss it!"
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,Actually... [coughs] I don't think I can even... stand... up... [raspy] Unless you've got more cookies!
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,"Aah! On second thought, maybe you better stay here and rest."
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,[sighs] Yeah. You're right. Sorry to miss out. I'm sure it's gonna be hilarious.
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,"All right, who's ready to sell some cookies?"
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,cutie mark crusaders,Me!
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,applejack,"Look here, Rainbow Dash. I know you promised Scootaloo you'd help out, but I don't want none of your pranks ruinin' these fillies' night."
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,"Look, I'll be with you the whole night so you can totally keep an eye on me."
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,"Come on, Applejack! Let's get started!"
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,scootaloo,Yeah! We've got a lot of ground to cover!
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,sweetie belle,We wanna hit every house in Ponyville!
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,applejack,I think you three should be real proud. Y'all did a mighty impressive job for your first go-'round.
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"You took the words right out of my mouth, Applejack. Isn't that right, Rainbow Dash?"
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,[hushed] Any minute now.
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,applejack,"Uh... ""any minute now"" what?"
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,"Huh? Oh, uh, nothing! Have you guys noticed how quiet it's gotten? I mean, it's still early, right?"
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"Of course it's quiet. Ponies can't talk while they're eating those fabulous cookies, heh."
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,You think?
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,rarity,Of course. They're probably all in a cookie coma right now.
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,Huh... Maybe you're right. I'll go check.
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,What is going on...? Okay. Definite cookie-eating happening. But... where is everypony? They must have seen their rainbow mouths by now... They should all be running out into the streets! Unless everypony went to bed early...
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,Pinkie?
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,"The whole town got the cookies, and now everypony is shut up in their houses! You don't think there's something wrong with the joke cookies, do you?"
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,Mrs. Cake! Phew! Have you seen Pinkie? I was thinking I might have something to do with her not feeling great.
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,Uh... Mrs... Cake...?
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,mrs. cake,Mrs. [droning] Cookies...! Cookies!
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,"[whimper] Uh, I can see you're busy! I'll come back!"
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,Uhh!
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,[droning] Cookies...!
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,mrs. cake,Mrs. [droning] More... cookies...!
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,mrs. cake,Mrs. [droning] Cookies...!
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,[droning] More cookies...
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,"[pant] Twilight! [pant] You gotta come with me to Sugarcube Corner! Something's going on with the Cakes! Well, not something exactly. I mean, it may have something to do with these joke cookies..."
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,[droning] Cooooooookies...
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,"Oh, no!"
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,[droning] Coooooookies...
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,[whimpers] Fluttershy<U+0097>
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,[droning] Cooooooookies...
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,granny smith,[groans] [droning] Cooooooookiiiiiiieeeeeeees...
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,granny smith,[droning] Cookies...
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,applejack,You sure you don't mind us all comin' over?
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"Oh, of course not. I think the girls have earned a little celebration for all of their hard work. And I have plenty of sewing machine cake left over. Unless anypony wants a cookie...?"
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,Don't touch those!
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,rarity,Oh! There is certainly no call for that! There's plenty for everypony.
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,Come on! We gotta get outta here!
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,applejack,What in tarnation are you goin' on about?
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,There's no time! You have to follow me!
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"Oh, Rainbow Dash, if you want all of those cookies, you will have to buy them, just like everypony else."
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,I don't want the cookies<U+0097>!
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,But they do!
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,rarity,Wh-wh-what... What's happening?
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,I'll explain later. Come on!
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,sweetie belle,We need to find somewhere to hide!
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,granny smith,Cookie! Cookie!
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,applejack,This way!
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,"[spits, pants] Did we lose them?"
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,scootaloo,[pants] Why are we running from the ponies of Ponyville?
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,sweetie belle,What happened to all of our friends?
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,[sighs] I think it's something in the cookies.
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,applejack,Ugh! That's ridiculous! Filly Guide cookies haven't changed for years! It's not like there's a new ingredient that's turnin' the whole town into cookie-cravin' zombies.
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,"Uh, unless there... is..."
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,rarity,What are you saying?
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,applejack,What did you do?
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,Cover the windows!
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,"[pants] Okay! So I may have switched all the Filly Guide cookies for joke cookies that were supposed to make ponies' mouths rainbow but somehow turned everypony into mindless cookie-eating zombies instead! I figure we just hide out here until the effects wear off, and as long as nopony else eats the cookies, we'll be fine."
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,rarity,"That's lovely, darling, except for one thing... [droning] We've already eaten theeeeeeeeeemmmmm..."
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,applejack,[droning] Looks like your prank up and backfiiiirrrrreeeeed...
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,cutie mark crusaders,[droning] Cooooooookiiiieeeees...
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,"No, no! Stay away! They're making you sick! You don't want these!"
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,[droning] But we dooooooo... We want cookiiiiiiiieeeeeeees...!
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,Nngh! Please! Stop! I never meant for this to happen! It was just a harmless prank! It was supposed to be funny! But this isn't funny at all!
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,[normal] Exactly!
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,What? Wait... What's happening?
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,rarity,Just delighting in pranking the prankster.
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,applejack,[chuckles] Yeah. How does it feel to get some of your own medicine?
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,So... you're... not sick? None of you are?
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,"Of course not, silly!"
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,This... was all... a prank?!
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,applejack,"Yep! And you can thank Pinkie Pie. After you told her about your plan to prank the whole town, she got everypony together and came up with a way to turn the tables on you."
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,"Aw, shucks, it was nothing! Just a little something I threw together."
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,Uh...
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,scootaloo,Wow! You should see your face!
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,[laughs] Talk about funny!
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,"[scoffs] Well, I don't think it's very funny! And I'm the one that got pranked! I was really scared! I thought I made everypony sick! You can't just go around<U+0097>"
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,<U+0097>pranking whoever you feel like?
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,fluttershy,Without thinking about how it might make them feel?
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,rarity,Or if they'd even enjoy it?
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,applejack,Or think it's funny?
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,rainbow dash,Yeah! [beat] Ohhh. I see what you did there.
28 Pranks Later,F.M. De Marco; story by Meghan McCarthy,pinkie pie,Pranks can be a lot of fun when everypony has a good time. I thought you just needed to see what it's like when they don't.

Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,discord,"Fun? With sidekicks? Oh, you must think that we're in a dimension where everything is opposite. [snap] ""Da-dee-la! I'm Opposite Discord, and I want to hang out with Spike and Big Mac! I'm sure I'd have fun!"""
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,discord,"[snap] Let me explain it to you as simply as I can. Me? Amazing! Them? Well, I've already forgotten who we're talking about. You see?"
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,fluttershy,All I'm saying is it's an opportunity to expand your circle of friends. [coddling] Unless you're afraid they won't like you?
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,discord,"Oh, please. Don't stoop to tedious reverse psychology. You're better than that."
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,fluttershy,It never hurts to make new friends.
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,discord,[scoffs] Consider it considered.
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,discord,Couldn't I just come with you instead?
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,fluttershy,Discord...
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,discord,"[gasps] Well, it's not my fault the new train route leads into an active volcano. Guess you'll have to stay."
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,applejack,"I got my bedroll, parka, unattractive but functional hikin' boots... Uh, anything I forgot, Pinkie Pie? You're our resident Yakyakistan expert."
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,Nope! I brought yeti food!
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,Did I forget to mention there's a pony-eating yeti on Frost Field Glacier? We're gonna have so much fun!
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,rainbow dash,"Heh. If he messes with us, I'll turn that yeti into confetti!"
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,applejack,Heh. Somepony's in an awful quick hurry to get us out of here. Don't y'all have too much fun without us.
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,twilight sparkle,"I bet you boys have big plans. Right, Spike?"
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,spike,"I'm sure I don't know what you're talking about. Although if I did, I certainly wouldn't be allowed to discuss it with you girls."
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,twilight sparkle,Buh-bye!
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,applejack,"Bye, y'all!"
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,spike,"[whispering] Uh, I dunno what to say. I mean, I hope he comes but I kinda don't want him to think of it..."
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,big mcintosh,[hushed] Yup.
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,discord,"Fascinating article, yes? [nervous laugh] [hushed, to himself] Don't let them come over, please don't let them come over, please don't let them come over, please, please, please<U+0097> [normal] Oh, salutations, my friend! Wish I could stay and chat, but I don't want to."
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,spike,"Wait! Um, we were wondering... What are you up to tonight?"
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,discord,"[to himself] Oh, here we go..."
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,spike,"Do you wanna, I don't know, hang out? Is that, like, something you do?"
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,discord,"Oh, Twilight's friend and Applejack's monosyllabic brother, if only I weren't super busy this evening."
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,spike,[to Big McIntosh] I guess guys' night will just be you and me.
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,discord,"A guys' night? You mean a rowdy evening of reckless revelry? Zoot suits, fedoras, swing dancing?"
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,spike,"Eh, something like that. [nervous] You should totally come. Three of us would be way better than two..."
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,discord,"That does sound fun, actually..."
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,spike,Too bad you're busy.
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,discord,"Well, I suppose I could squeeze you in if I move a few very important ponies around."
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,discord,"[gravelly accent] June, honey, be a dear. Reschedule Luna and Cay-Cay. [normal, aside] That's what I call Princess Celestia, what a hoot! [gravelly accent] In fact, clear the whole evening. Tonight is guys' night. These fellas invited me to spice things up and bring a little class to the whole affair."
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,discord,"[normal voice] Tonight will be the best night of your lives, and not just because you get to bask in my greatness."
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,spike,I do like basking in things. See you tonight. [hushed] Twilight's castle. The fun starts promptly at sundown.
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,discord,"Technically, the fun starts when I arrive, but I'll make sure it's around sunset. Adieu, fellas."
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,spike,"And... we have sundown. Repeat, we have sundown. I declare tonight's guys' night ceremonies officially open!"
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,big mcintosh,Eeyup!
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,spike,It's guys' night.
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,big mcintosh,Yup.
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,spike,"Oh, yeah."
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,big mcintosh,Yup.
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,spike,Havin' fun now.
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,big mcintosh,Yup.
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,spike,"Oh, yeah!"
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,big mcintosh,"Oh, yeah!"
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,spike,What the hay?
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,discord,"So, shall we hop to it? I made a list of the rowdiest establishments in Ponyville. It's rather short."
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,spike,"Actually, we're staying here. I hope you like awesome games!"
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,discord,Games? I love games. I'm great at games.
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,discord,"Famous pony charades? Oh, this is an easy one. Who am I? Huh? Huh?"
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,discord,"Oh, come on!"
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,spike,Uh... I'm talkin' about a real game.
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,discord,"Oh, you mean like trapping best friend ponies in hedge mazes and turning them against each other. Those were the days."
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,spike,Not exactly. Wait here.
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,discord,"Whatever it is, it can only get better by adding me to the mix."
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,spike,[off-screen] Okay!
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,spike,"In a world where evil reigns supreme, a small band of warriors stands tall against the darkness. This is... Ogres & Oubliettes!"
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,discord,"Oh, this looks like..."
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,spike,The best game ever? You're right!
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,discord,Yes...
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,spike,"Ogres & Oubliettes is a fantasy role-playing adventure game. Our goal, defeat the evil Squid Wizard, or... [stifling laughter] as we call him... the Squizard!"
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,spike,"[chuckling] [clears throat] The Squizard has laid siege to the last free city in Spiketopia. That's the name of the land. He's kidnapped a beautiful unicorn princess named Shmarity. [beat] Uh, which is like a normal name in Spiketopia, so, you know, don't think about it too much."
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,discord,Fear not. Your romantic delusions are safe with me.
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,spike,First things first <U+0096> you've gotta create a character! Name?
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,discord,How about... Discord?
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,spike,"[sighs] The whole point of the game is you get to use your imagination to be someone you're not. I'm Garbunkle, a famous magician. Everyone treats me with the utmost respect."
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,discord,Just like in real life?
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,spike,"And don't get jealous, but I'm a level 30 Enchanter with major skill points assigned to Intellect and Perception."
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,discord,"[not listening] Go on, I'm listening."
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,spike,"Big Mac's character is Sir McBiggun, a level 27 Black Knight Unicorn from Castle Chadwick!"
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,discord,[still not listening] I'm listening.
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,spike,"When his king aligned himself with the Squizard, Sir McBiggun would not besmirch his honor."
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,big mcintosh,Nnope!
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,discord,[clears throat] [mumbling] I'm listening.
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,spike,"And so it came to pass, the magician and black knight vowed to rid Spiketopia of the evil Squizard."
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,spike,"So, your character's name?"
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,discord,"I already have the best name in the universe. Why would I change it for something like ""Captain Wuzz""?"
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,spike,Captain Wuzz it is!
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,spike,"What class are you, Captain Wuzz? There's Archers, Mages, Rogues..."
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,discord,"[snorts] Can I suggest we take a break and, I don't know, go out and have some fun? Ponyville's not going to paint itself red."
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,spike,You'll love it once we get started! [rolls die] How 'bout an Archer?
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,discord,Sounds just as miserable as the other options. So fine.
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,spike,"Sir McBiggun, are you prepared to enter the world of Ogres & Oubliettes?"
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,big mcintosh,Eeyup.
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,spike,"Discord, or should I say, Captain Wuzz, are you<U+0097>"
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,discord,"Oh, get on with it."
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,spike,[rolls dice] We find ourselves trapped in the dungeon of the evil Squizard. The bars are locked tight.
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,spike,The bars exist in our imagination.
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,discord,"Really? You describe things, and then we pretend it's real?"
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,spike,It is real. In our imagination. It's your turn first. What do you wanna do?
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,discord,"Curse myself for attending this infernal evening? Ohhh, no, you mean in the game."
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,spike,"Well, you can do whatever you want. Then, I roll this twenty-sided die and see if you're successful."
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,discord,I stick my head through the bars and demand for the immediate release of the Lord of Chaos.
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,spike,"That's a big risk. You have to roll a seventeen or higher to succeed. [rolls die] Ooh, bad idea. The guard gets mad."
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,discord,This spell here. I transform him into a parsnip.
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,spike,You need eleven Intelligent points to cast a Transform Into Root Vegetable spell.
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,discord,I'm not intelligent? I cast it anyway because this game is stupid.
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,spike,[rolls die] The spell backfires. So [stifling laughter] your claws grow leaves and transform into parsnips!
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,spike,"The guard laughs. He calls his friends over, and they laugh too."
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,discord,"Don't you laugh at me, Big Mac! Does it really say that? Let me see."
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,spike,"[rolls die] [laughs] As you get angrier, everypony laughs harder!"
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,discord,I seal Sir McBiggun in a magic bubble until he stops laughing!
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,spike,"I told you, you can't do magic!"
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,big mcintosh,Whoaa! Nope! Nope! Nope!
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,discord,"""Not intelligent enough."" Please."
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,spike,"Cut it out, Discord!"
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,discord,"Oh, this game is insufferable! Let me show you a real guys' night!"
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,discord,"[laughing] This is the life! Jazz, dancing, the best table magic can buy! This is what guys' night is all about. Am I right, fellas?"
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,big mcintosh,Eeyup!
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,spike,"I know you probably didn't do this on purpose, but this table's the perfect size and shape!"
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,discord,I don't think so. Let's have a drink. Chocolate milkshakes?
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,spike,"[sighs] No, we want to go back to Ogres &<U+0097>"
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,discord,"Oh, how 'bout a different game? [magic zap] Those are very bad cards."
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,spike,Stop messing with us! We wanna<U+0097>
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,discord,A dance contest?
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,discord,Surprise! We won!
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,spike,Discord!
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,discord,[sinister] Yes?
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,spike,"Look, we don't wanna do these things. We wanna play our game. If you don't want to play with us, you can, I don't know, sit and watch."
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,discord,Sit and watch? Fine. We'll play your game. [reverberating] Are you ready to enter the world of Ogres & Oubliettes?
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,spike,Sir McBiggun?!
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,big mcintosh,Eeyup!
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,spike,And I'm... Garbunkle? That means... Sweetness! We're in the game! Check it out! Ka-zam!
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,spike,It's guys' night!
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,big mcintosh,Eeyup!
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,spike,"Oh, yeah!"
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,big mcintosh,Yup!
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,spike,In the game now!
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,big mcintosh,Yup!
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,spike,"Oh, yeah!"
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,big mcintosh,"Oh, yeah!"
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,spike,"Discord, where are you? This is great! You made the game real!"
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,discord,[reverberating] [laughs] Aren't games fun?
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,spike,Should we be worried he's using his scary voice?
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,discord,[reverberating] [chuckles] You're welcome.
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,spike,Run!
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,discord,"[reverberating] You find yourself on the battlefield. A barrage of arrows rains down on you. If you roll a fifteen or higher, the shield protects you. Fourteen or lower and, well... [laughs] You get the idea."
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,discord,Seventeen! Lucky you!
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,discord,Boo.
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,discord,Boo.
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,spike,Discord!
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,discord,"Sir McBiggun, I'd cover the entrance if I were you."
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,spike,This isn't funny!
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,discord,Isn't this what every gamer wants? To live the game? Like this?!
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,spike,Ugh!
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,spike,"[groans] This kinda hurts! Like, real pain!"
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,discord,"Oh, how kind of you to notice. It's the little details that really bring alternate dimensions to life, wouldn't you say?"
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,spike,"Discord, this is awful!"
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,spike,Why are you doing this? You're the worst!
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,discord,"If I'm the worst, then why did you invite me?"
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,spike,Because we felt bad for you!
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,discord,Because you... what?!
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,spike,"[panting] We're okay, we're okay! No thanks to you, Discord!"
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,discord,You felt sorry for me?
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,spike,"Who wouldn't? Fluttershy told us you practically begged her to stay! And then at the train station, you were just standing there, all alone!"
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,discord,This can't be. I'm supposed to feel sorry for you because I'm me and you're you.
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,spike,"[sighs] We only invited you to be nice! I mean, you're kind of a... weirdo!"
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,big mcintosh,Eeyup.
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,discord,"I ruined your night, and you don't even think I'm cool? Ugh. [zap] [muffled] How embarrassing. I should go. [normal] I have a lot of other friends I need to see tonight."
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,spike,Good!
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,discord,"Yes, so many other friends. [whimpers] Farewell, Garbunkle the magician and brave Sir McBiggun. May providence smile upon thee in thy quest to rid Spiketopia of the dreaded Squizard... [sighs] When I say it that way, the game doesn't sound half bad."
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,discord,"Oh, well."
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,spike,"[sighs] It... it's better this way, right?"
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,big mcintosh,Eeyup.
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,spike,"Because... now he can't bother us, 'cause he's off somewhere by himself... all alone... with no friends."
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,big mcintosh,Yup.
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,spike,"[sighs] [clears throat] [unenthusiastic] We find ourselves in the dungeon of the evil Squizard. The bars are locked, and... Ah, who am I kidding? We should give him another chance. [clears throat] Captain Wuzz? Can you hear me?"
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,discord,Oh! You realized how amazing I am and that I make you cooler just by being around me?
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,discord,"Uh... [stammering] No, no, actually, that's not what I meant to say... I'm... sssssss..."
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,spike,What?
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,discord,I'm ssssssss<U+0097>
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,spike,Can't hear you.
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,big mcintosh,Nope.
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,discord,"I'm trying to say I'm sorry, all right?! I'm sorry for ruining your game, and I'm sorry that I thought I was better than you! [pants] [quickly] Now let's play before this evening gets any sappier, shall we?"
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,spike,"Huh? Yeah, yeah! Okay! What if we forgot the board and the pieces for a minute? I mean, the whole game coming to life was completely terrifying, but also kind of the best thing ever! So, uh, Big Mac and I were wondering... What if you toned it down just a teensy bit?"
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,spike,"I've got your back, Captain Wuzz!"
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,big mcintosh,Wha-hah!
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,discord,[accented] Garbunkle! Follow my lead!
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,spike,Bull's-eye!
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,discord,Nice one!
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,big mcintosh,Eeyup!
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,big mcintosh,Eeyup!
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,big mcintosh,Eeyup!
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,big mcintosh,"Oh, yeah!"
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,twilight sparkle,We should just close the door and let them finish... whatever this... is.
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,rainbow dash,No way! Did you see Big Mac's sword? I totally want in!
Dungeons & Discords,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,"Yeah! I don't know what it is, but it looks like super duper fun!"
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,rainbow dash,"Hey, Applejack! Whatcha doin'?"
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,applejack,"Whoa! Oof! Ugh! Well, I was practicin' my distance buckin'."
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,rainbow dash,"Uh, distance bucking? What for?"
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,applejack,Because Cousin Braeburn and the rest of the Apple family in Appleloosa seem to think that their team can beat Ponyville at buckball.
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,rainbow dash,"What?! Ha! That's ridiculous! Nopony beats Ponyville! I mean, I could beat the whole town of Appleloosa at buckball with one wing tied behind my back!"
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,applejack,So I can count on ya to join the Ponyville buckball team?
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,rainbow dash,"Oh, yeah! I am so there! I've just got one question."
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,applejack,Hmm?
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,rainbow dash,Uh... what's buckball?
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,rainbow dash,"So, basically, buckball is the coolest game ever. Offense, defense, teamwork, nonstop action! It's got it all!"
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,fluttershy,"Wow, Rainbow Dash. You sure seem to know a lot about this game. I've never even heard of... buckball."
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,rainbow dash,"Yeah, I'm kind of an expert."
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,applejack,Hmph. An expert who hadn't heard of the game either until I told you.
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,rainbow dash,"Well, it's a new game. I probably know more than most ponies, so that makes me an expert."
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,pinkie pie,"I don't know anything about it at all. But it sounds like there's a ball and bucking, so I'm betting it's super duper fun!"
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,applejack,"The point is, my cousin Braeburn somehow convinced a Pegasus and a unicorn to come play with him on the Appleloosa team, and he can't stop braggin' about how his team is gonna beat ours!"
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,fluttershy,"But, um, we don't have a team."
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,rainbow dash,"Well, between Applejack and me, we've got two-thirds of a team. All we need is a unicorn. That's where you two come in."
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,pinkie pie,"[whispering loudly to Fluttershy] Uh... they know we're not unicorns, right?"
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,rainbow dash,"Uh, obviously. You're gonna be on my team, and Fluttershy is gonna be on Applejack's team."
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,applejack,We'll play against each other along with whatever unicorns want to try out until we find the best one.
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,pinkie pie,Ohhhh! Phew! That's a relief because I left my unicorn costume at home!
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,applejack,"I know a lot of you are here because I told you what an amazin' game buckball is. And even though it's already an Apple family favorite, most o' you probably don't know anything about it. So I thought we'd give you a quick demonstration. The two Earth ponies are on offense. They meet in the middle of the field for the buckoff. They both try to be the first one to kick it."
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,rainbow dash,"And the Pegasus is on defense. She tries to keep the ball from going in the goal and passes it back to the Earth pony on her team. Just give it a little kick, Pinkie."
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,pinkie pie,Yaah!
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,fluttershy,Aah!
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,pinkie pie,Ohhh. I get it.
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,applejack,And all the unicorns have to do is float these here baskets around the outside of the field and catch as many balls as possible for their team. [to Pinkie and Fluttershy] You two get the idea?
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,pinkie pie,Absolutely!
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,fluttershy,"Oh, I don't know. That ball moves pretty fast."
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,rainbow dash,All right. Now let's see which of you has what it takes.
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,rainbow dash,"When the ball comes towards you, catch it."
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,applejack,"Okay, just try your best, Pinkie. I have been doin' this a lot longer than you."
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,pinkie pie,[grunts] Aah!
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,applejack,[dazzled] Nice kick.
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,applejack,"Great save, Fluttershy!"
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,rainbow dash,"Coming your way, Pinkie!"
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,pinkie pie,Somersault kick!
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,pinkie pie,"Hey, this game is easy!"
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,fluttershy,Ooh! [giggles] It actually is kinda fun!
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,applejack,Where did Pinkie Pie learn to buck like that?
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,rainbow dash,And Fluttershy's spinning tail catch is pretty amazing.
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,applejack,"Um... okay. Well, let's see what the rest of you can do."
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,applejack,"Now, don't expect to be able to beat me twice in a row."
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,fluttershy,"Well, hello there, Mr. Ball. Whee!"
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,rainbow dash,Hiya!
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,fluttershy,"Hurry along, butterflies, before that ball comes and hits you."
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,applejack,Nope. Um... okay. Let's see what the rest of you can do.
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,rainbow dash,Nope.
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,applejack,Definitely not.
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,rainbow dash,No.
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,applejack,Not a chance.
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,rainbow dash,No.
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,applejack,Nope.
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,rainbow dash,Aaaand... no.
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,rainbow dash,[groans] This didn't go how I thought it would.
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,pinkie pie,"Whee! [giggles, grunts] Yeah! Ha! [giggles] Whee! Ha ha!"
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,applejack,It sure didn't.
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,fluttershy,This game is a whole lot more fun than I thought it would be.
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,pinkie pie,It's exactly as much fun as I thought it would be! A whole bunch!
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,snails,"Carryin' my water My water, my water Carryin' my water On my shoulder pole"
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,pinkie pie,Snails! Look out!
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,snails,Hmm?
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,applejack,Amazing!
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,snails,You should be more careful with these. You could lose them.
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,rainbow dash,"Hey, Snails, can you float one of those baskets over here?"
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,snails,Hmm? Sure. What do you want me to do with it?
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,applejack,Catch!
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,snails,Anything else?
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,fluttershy,"Wow, Snails. You're a natural at buckball."
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,pinkie pie,"It's a good thing, too. We were running out of unicorns."
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,fluttershy,Do you think you'll be ready to play with Applejack and Rainbow Dash against the Appleloosa team?
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,snails,"I guess I'll find out. Plus, after I deliver this water, I don't really have anything else to do."
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,rainbow dash,"Well, Snails, with you on the team, Ponyville is one step closer to crushing Appleloosa!"
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,applejack,"Huh. And after today, it's pretty clear who the other two players should be."
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,fluttershy,W-What do you mean? I thought you and Dash were gonna play.
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,pinkie pie,"Yeah! If you're not crushing Appleloosa, who is?"
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,rainbow dash,"[laughs] Uh, you two, obviously!"
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,fluttershy,"Um, you want us to play buckball against Appleloosa instead of you?"
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,rainbow dash,Mm-hmm.
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,pinkie pie,"That's ""uncredible""!"
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,pinkie pie,Unbelievable and incredible? [scoffs] Come on!
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,applejack,"I can't explain it, but you two are really good at this game. And if it means beatin' Appleloosa, I'll give either one of you my spot on the team quicker than Granny Smith can core an apple."
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,rainbow dash,"Me, too. I'd normally be so pumped all of Ponyville was counting on me to win, I'd run right over the competition. But you still flew rings around me."
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,fluttershy,"Oh, I'm sorry. I was just having fun."
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,applejack,"Well, you can have all the fun you want as long as it's while you're beatin' the hide off of Braeburn's team."
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,pinkie pie,I do like fun!
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,fluttershy,"Honestly, the game was a little scary at first, but once I got the hang of it, I had a pretty good time."
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,pinkie pie,Let's get this party started!
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,applejack,"All right. But if we really wanna beat Appleloosa, we're gonna have to get serious."
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,fluttershy,Serious?
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,pinkie pie,Serious how?
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,applejack,With serious practice!
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,fluttershy,[gulps] Wow. This looks pretty intense.
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,rainbow dash,"Well, duh! You two are gonna be representing all of Ponyville. And, more importantly, us!"
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,applejack,"That's why, before we leave for Appleloosa tomorrow, you two are gonna practice just as hard as we would."
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,rainbow dash,So let's hop to it! Snails already has a head start on you!
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,rainbow dash,"Okay, if you wanna win, you totally gotta get this drill down!"
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,fluttershy,I-I-I do?
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,rainbow dash,It's all about ball control.
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,fluttershy,[gasps] Whoa!
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,rainbow dash,"Ready? Go! Come on! Faster! You don't want Ponyville to lose because you can't get into high gear, do you?!"
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,fluttershy,[gasps] Whoa! Ugh!
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,applejack,All right. Bein' able to buck a ball into a goal from any direction is the most important thing in the game.
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,pinkie pie,"Eh, if you say so."
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,pinkie pie,Whee! Woo-hoo!
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,applejack,Keep it up! Just one miss'll ruin the Apple family's buckball reputation forever!
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,pinkie pie,Whoops.
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,rainbow dash,Come on! Push! Push! Push!
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,applejack,"Come on, now! Every shot is for Sweet Apple Acres! And me! And Dash! And all of Ponyville!"
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,pinkie pie,Whoa! Uhh! Ow.
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,rainbow dash,Faster!
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,fluttershy,Whoa!
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,applejack,Come on now!
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,pinkie pie,Wh-Wh-Whoa!
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,rainbow dash,Come on!
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,applejack,Keep it up!
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,pinkie pie,Whoa!
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,rainbow dash,Come on!
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,applejack,What in the apple happened to those two?
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,rainbow dash,I don't know. They mopped the field with us before.
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,applejack,"All right! That's it for today, y'all!"
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,pinkie pie,I thought practice was supposed to make us better.
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,fluttershy,Maybe we just need a little rest.
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,rainbow dash,Or a whole lot of it.
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,applejack,Just be sure to get your heads in the game before tomorrow. All of Ponyville is countin' on a win.
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,fluttershy,"I really don't want to let Applejack and Rainbow Dash down, or anypony else, but after that practice, I'm not feeling very confident."
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,pinkie pie,Maybe we weren't that bad!
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,pinkie pie,I guess I was hoping you saw something I didn't.
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,fluttershy,"I know our friends want us to win, but how can the whole town be counting on us if most ponies have never even heard of buckball?"
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,pinkie pie,I know! How can we disappoint a pony who doesn't even know we have a team?
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,fluttershy,Or that we're gonna play Appleloosa?
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,pinkie pie,Pfft. Yeah. I don't think we need to worry. I'd be surprised if anypony in this town cares about this game at all.
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,snails,Whoa. The whole town really seems to care about this game a lot.
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,rainbow dash,Heh. We kinda went around town and talked up the team a little.
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,applejack,Yup! We wanted to make sure you two knew that all of Ponyville was behind you!
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,pinkie pie,[nervous] Greaaaaat...
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,applejack,I hear the whole town's already plannin' a parade for when you get back after whuppin' Appleloosa! That should feel pretty good!
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,fluttershy,[nervous] It should...?
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,rainbow dash,"Totally! Just spend the whole ride to Appleloosa thinking about everypony cheering for the victorious Ponyville buckball team! [gasps] I bet Princess Celestia even comes to congratulate you! If that doesn't get you in ""the zone"", I don't know what will!"
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,fluttershy,"I don't know what zone Rainbow Dash is talking about, but I'm pretty sure I don't want to be in it. Do you?"
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,rainbow dash,Hey! You two are supposed to be in the zone!
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,pinkie pie,[squeaks] You see... the thing is... thinking about everypony... thinking about us...! Aah! There's just no way to...!
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,fluttershy,"There's no way that we can get in the zone, because the zone sounds like a horrible place since we are terrible at buckball and we are going to lose and let everypony down and we don't want to play anymore!"
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,snails,"I'm still okay with playing, in case you were worried."
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,rainbow dash,I don't get it. They're naturals! Why wouldn't they want to play anymore?
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,applejack,Maybe us telling them how much everypony was countin' on them messed them up somehow.
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,rainbow dash,What?! That's crazy talk! Having ponies depend on you is exactly what you need to focus! And<U+0097>
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,applejack,Get serious and play hard and<U+0097>
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,rainbow dash,"Get ready to totally smash the competition, and<U+0097> and... none of that sounds like Pinkie or Fluttershy, does it?"
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,applejack,"[sighs] Guess not. We got so wrapped up in what's important to us, we went and ruined what was fun about the game for them."
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,rainbow dash,[groans] What do we do now?
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,rainbow dash,Pinkie? Fluttershy?
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,applejack,We know you're in here! We've looked in every other car on the train!
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,fluttershy,[muffled] Maybe you need to look again!
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,pinkie pie,[muffled] Yeah! Because... we're totally not in here!
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,fluttershy,[muffled] And we're definitely not in here if you're gonna try and make us play against Appleloosa!
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,pinkie pie,Or anypony else!
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,fluttershy,Oh... we're sorry to let you down. But it's better to do it now than during the game against Appleloosa.
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,rainbow dash,You don't have to play against Appleloosa.
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,fluttershy,We don't?
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,applejack,Nope. We're gonna take your place. So you don't have to worry about that at all.
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,pinkie pie,[sighs] Why didn't you say so?
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,rainbow dash,But... we can't take on Braeburn and his team without any practice. So we need you to play just one more time.
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,applejack,Against us.
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,applejack,"Now I know we mixed up the teams before, but since Dash and I really need the practice, we'll play against the two of you."
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,fluttershy,"Oh, I don't know how much practice you'll get against us. We've been playing just awful."
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,rainbow dash,Don't worry about it. Applejack and I just need a little workout.
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,applejack,Yup. You two just do your best.
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,pinkie pie,I can do that!
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,applejack,Ahem.
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,fluttershy,[grunts] Huh!
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,fluttershy,Looks like you two really do need practice!
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,pinkie pie,Hee-hee! Ha! Whee!
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,fluttershy,"[giggling] If you need more practice, we can keep going."
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,pinkie pie,Yeah! I could do this all day!
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,rainbow dash,"[panting] No, thanks. Playing against you two is just as humiliating now as it was when we weren't trying to show you how awesome you are."
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,pinkie pie,Wait... what?
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,snails,Finally!
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,applejack,You must've noticed how you aren't bad anymore.
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,pinkie pie,"Oh, yeah! Weird!"
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,fluttershy,"But, um, why were we so terrible before?"
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,rainbow dash,"I guess some ponies thrive on pressure and some ponies don't. And even though we weren't playing, we were treating you like us, which totally stressed you out."
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,applejack,And that just sucked the fun right out of the game for you.
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,rainbow dash,"And having fun is what makes you really, really, really good!"
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,fluttershy,But being good doesn't matter if we're too afraid of letting ponies down.
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,pinkie pie,Yeah! What about all those ponies back in Ponyville counting on us to win?
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,applejack,"I'm sure folks want you to win, but not if worrying about it makes you miserable. Winning's never worth that."
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,fluttershy,But how do we keep from worrying about it?
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,snails,You could do what I do and not think about it. Seriously. I don't think about anything. Ever.
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,pinkie pie,Hm. Works for me!
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,rainbow dash,You guys are amazing!
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,pinkie pie,[panting] Braeburn is really good!
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,fluttershy,"So is that Pegasus. Oh, I don't know if we can win."
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,snails,You know what I would do?
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,pinkie pie,Not think about it?
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,snails,"Not think a<U+0097> [beat] Oh, yeah. That."
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,applejack,"Ha. And as long as you're havin' fun, it doesn't matter if you win or not."
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,pinkie pie,[giggles] I think it's more fun this way!
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,applejack,Huh. Looks like you three made quite an impression!
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,braeburn,"Well, cousin, I have to admit. Your Ponyville team played a pretty good game."
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,rainbow dash,Hah! Good game? We bucked the hooves right off of you!
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,braeburn,"Yup, you sure as shootin' did. I'm gonna have to get real serious about a strategy for our rematch."
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,fluttershy,"Oh, I wouldn't get too serious."
Buckball Season,Jennifer Skelly,pinkie pie,Yeah! Everypony knows the secret to good buckball is just having fun!
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,sweetie belle,So Scootaloo's keeping Petunia busy like you asked. What did you two want to talk about?
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,What's wrong?
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,sweetie belle,Unsettling?
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,I don't get what you mean.
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,scootaloo,Hey! Check out what we found!
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,scootaloo,"Of course! What'd you think she was gonna be, a pirate?"
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,scootaloo,"Woo-hoo! Another successful cutie intervention! You know, Crusaders, I don't wanna toot our own horn, but we've helped a lot of ponies figure out their purpose in life. Like Bluenote here. Nice saxophone, Bluenote!"
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,"Yep, everywhere you look, there's a pony we've helped find a purpose."
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,You've gotta admit. We've had a pretty good effect on everypony since we've discovered our destiny.
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,scootaloo,And started helping other ponies discover theirs! Could this get any better or what?
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,sweetie belle,"Now, Scootaloo, you do know there will always be challenges? Someday, somepony might even come to us with a problem that even we can't handle. Like, say..."
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,A griffon?
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,sweetie belle,Ha! Exactly! Like a griffon. But that's just crazy talk.
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,scootaloo,Or not!
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,sweetie belle,Is that really a griffon?
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,You're darn tootin' it is! What do you think that griffon wants?
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,sweetie belle,"I guess we've gotta ask her, but aren't griffons supposed to be kind of mean and cranky?"
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,scootaloo,"Crusaders, looks like we've gotta step carefully."
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,scootaloo,[strained voice] Aah! Ooh! This... griffon's... not... cranky.
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,How in the blooming apples did you know who we are?
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,gabby,"Know who you are? Know who you are?! Why, I've heard about you from everypony in Ponyville! I'm so excited to meet you, I could just explode! I'm Gabriella, but you can call me Gabby since we're friends now! Pleased to meet ya!"
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,"Well, howdy... um... Gabby."
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,gabby,[squeals] I'm just about the most excited anygriffon has ever been about anything!
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,sweetie belle,Excited? But whatever for?
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,gabby,What for? What for?! Everypony in town tells me of your amazing assistance! How you help ponies find their place in the world!
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,scootaloo,"It's a calling, but<U+0097>"
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,gabby,"And that's why I'm here. I need help, too. I want you to give me a cutie mark!"
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,"Um, can a griffon even get a cutie mark?"
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,scootaloo,"I dunno, but I think we should probably find out."
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,scootaloo,"So, Gabriella..."
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,gabby,"Gabby, 'kay?"
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,scootaloo,"Gabby, why do you even want a cutie mark?"
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,scootaloo,It doesn't seem like a very... griffon-y thing to want.
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,gabby,Right? Right?! Right?!
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,gabby,"You're tellin' me! I don't know if you've heard, but griffons can be a little bit... unfriendly."
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,gabby,"[voiceover] Most griffons don't pay much attention to each other. And if they do, it's not, y'know, the good kind of attention. As for me, I'm just a little mail delivery griffon who likes to spread a little bit of griffon-y sunshine on my rounds, which always makes me feel different from the other griffons."
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,gabby,[voiceover] I'd do anything for any old griffon in need.
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,gabby,"[voiceover] But it just always seemed like the harder I tried, the less I fit in. It wasn't until your friends came to Griffonstone that I realized some creatures actually like helping each other, and I saw something so awesomely awesome <U+0096> how helping spreads from pony to pony and griffon to griffon! I knew then that I had to find out why I was so different from the other griffons, and I knew the answer just had to have something to do with those wonderful, amazing marks on the ponies' flanks. And I admit, hehe, I became, um, maybe a little obsessed. So first chance I had to deliver a letter from Gilda, I took it, so I could find the perfect pony to help me understand what those marks are. Everypony here told me one thing <U+0096> I just had to see the Cutie Mark Crusaders! They've helped everypony here get their cutie marks, and I knew, I just knew, that someday I'd have one, too! A cutie mark of my very own!"
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,gabby,"That's why I flew all the way here! I want to find my own place in the world, and I know you can help me by giving me a cutie mark! So let's make with the cutie! [giggles] Whenever you're ready. Did it happen yet?"
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,sweetie belle,"Uh, not exactly."
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,gabby,Howboutnowhowboutnowhowboutnowhowboutnow?
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,"Um, Gabby, I hate to break it to ya, but it sounds like you might've heard some tall tales about what Crusaders can do."
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,scootaloo,"I mean, we are kinda awesome and all, but nopony can just give you a cutie mark. It just sort of... happens."
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,sweetie belle,"Though I'm pretty sure it doesn't happen to griffons. Or if it does, we've never ever heard of it."
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,gabby,"Oh. I hadn't thought of that. Sounds like a challenge! And who could be up to it but the world-famous Cutie Mark Crusaders? Cutie marks! It's in your name and everything, right? Right?! Right?! Now I have to deliver Gilda's letter to Rainbow Dash. I bet by the time I get back, you'll have it one hundred percent figured out! Toodles for now! Whee-hee-hee! Gonna get my cutie mark!"
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,sweetie belle,"What she wants... It's not possible, right?"
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,scootaloo,I don't know. But I know someone who just might.
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"I've read every book on the subject, and I've never read a thing about any creature other than a pony getting a cutie mark."
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,scootaloo,"But, Twilight, Gabby flew all the way here so we could help her. There's gotta be something we can do."
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,sweetie belle,"Say, is there some kind of spell you can whip up to make her mark appear?"
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"Um, I don't know if any of you remember, but using magic to get a cutie mark never really works out all that well."
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,cutie mark crusaders,Ohhh. Right.
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"Crusaders, I'm sorry. While I can't say for certain that it's utterly impossible, the chances of Gabby getting an actual mark are... pretty slim. Everything I've ever learned tells me. It's just not gonna happen."
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,"Oh, no! Poor Gabby! What the apples are we ever gonna tell her?"
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,sweetie belle,"Crusaders, this is terrible! Gabby really believed in us. And now, we're gonna let her down."
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,But what else can we do?
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,scootaloo,"Hmm. You know what, Crusaders? So what? Maybe we can't help Gabby get a cutie mark, but we can still do what we're best at. We can help her find her purpose!"
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,And I reckon doing that is the same for griffons as it is for ponies or any other creature in Equestria.
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,scootaloo,"All we have to do is be extra-special clear with her. Like, Crystal Empire clear."
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,cutie mark crusaders,Yeah!
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,gabby,Incoming!
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,gabby,"Hiya, you wonderful, wonderful Crusaders! I just know you've figured out how to help me because you're all so incredible!"
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,scootaloo,"Well, Gabby, we've talked it over, and we think we may just be able to help you out. But not exactly in the way you think. See, here's the thing about you getting a cutie mark<U+0097>"
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,scootaloo,Wait! You didn't let me finish!
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,sweetie belle,"Um, I think maybe that could've been clearer."
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,sweetie belle,She's still going. Anypony know if griffons ever get tired?
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,gabby,"What do you think my mark will be? A lightning bolt? An erupting volcano? I don't care if it's a jar of marmalade! I know I'll love it, whatever it is!"
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,"Hold on just a hoofstep, Gabby. There's somethin' we need to clear up. We can definitely help you find your purpose, but that mark's probably not gonna happen."
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,gabby,What?!?
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,scootaloo,It's true. Twilight's never heard of a creature other than a pony getting a cutie mark.
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,gabby,"Oh! [laughs] Is that all? You had me worried for a second. I-I mean, there's a first time for everything, right? And she didn't say it was impossible, right?"
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,"Well, not exactly."
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,gabby,"Well, then if anypony can make it happen, it's you three. I mean, you haven't failed yet."
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,scootaloo,"You know what, Gabby? I promise we're gonna do everything we can to help you get your mark."
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,sweetie belle,Aaaaand... she's off again.
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,Why in tarnation would you promise somethin' that just can't be done?
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,scootaloo,I know what it's like to want something that's out of reach. And just because it hasn't happened yet doesn't mean it can't. Maybe trying for the impossible isn't so bad.
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,sweetie belle,Guess we'll never know for sure unless we give it a try.
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,"All right, but where do we even start?"
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,scootaloo,Where we always do <U+0096> with a good old-fashioned Crusaders chart.
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,The first thing we gotta do is find your purpose.
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,scootaloo,Nopony gets a mark without one.
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,gabby,All right. Let's do this.
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,scootaloo,What are you good at? Do you play any sports?
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,Or like to dance?
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,sweetie belle,Or how about singing? I just love to sing! La-la-la-la!
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,gabby,"Wow! I kinda wanna just try everything! I mean, I don't even know what to pick!"
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,scootaloo,Don't worry. That's what we're here for.
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,sweetie belle,Like a racer at the starting line You're chomping at the bit
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,scootaloo,You are here to find your purpose And a place you really fit
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,And until you find your place in life You're never gonna quit
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,cutie mark crusaders,We can help you find the purpose in your life
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,gabby,A griffon mixes lion's strength With winged eagle's might When I finally find my purpose Then my cutie mark's in sight
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,cutie mark crusaders,"That's the spirit You ought to see what you do best Try it all, pick your fave And leave behind the rest"
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,gabby,"I'll try anything To get my cutie mark Keep up with me, Crusaders We're just getting our start"
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,cutie mark crusaders,Can we help her find the purpose in her life?
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,gabby,"Cheer you if you're feeling low Plant your garden, make it grow Write a piece for your quartet Filling in on clarinet"
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,cutie mark crusaders,"She's so good at things, it's frightening Cutie Mark Crusaders, I think we've got a problem!"
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,gabby,Build a boat And sail it out across the sea Need some help? You know that you can count on me
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,Now how we gonna do this?
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,sweetie belle,"Gabby's special purpose can't be everything, right?"
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,It may as well be. I don't know how we find what she's supposed to do when she can do it all.
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,scootaloo,"[sighs] And if finding her purpose seems impossible, we can just forget about the whole griffon-getting-a-cutie-mark thing, which is actually impossible. I never should've gotten her hopes up!"
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,gabby,"I did... it... all! So, lay it on me, Crusaders. What's my purpose? And how do we get a mark on these here haunches?"
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,scootaloo,"Gabby, we... we don't."
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,gabby,Wait. What are you saying?
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,We're sayin' that since you can do everything so amazingly well...
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,sweetie belle,We just can't figure out what one thing you're supposed to do.
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,scootaloo,"Gabby, we can't help you."
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,gabby,"But, but... you're the world-famous Cutie Mark Crusaders! I can't believe it! I... I... I won't believe it!"
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,"Gabby, wait!"
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,scootaloo,"We're sorry! We're so, so sorry! This is just awful. For the first time ever, the Cutie Mark Crusaders are cutie mark failures."
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,scootaloo,"I'm sorry, Crusaders. I really thought we could help Gabby."
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,sweetie belle,I thought we could help anypony.
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,Maybe that's just it <U+0096> maybe we can only help ponies.
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,scootaloo,Or maybe we just plain failed.
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,gabby,Failed? Then what do you call this?!
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,cutie mark crusaders,A cutie mark?!
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,sweetie belle,What? You got your mark after all! Even though we couldn't find your purpose? But<U+0096> What? Huh?! How?!
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,And what does it mean? A cauldron?
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,gabby,"Uh... I don't know. Maybe it means my purpose is, uh, helping Zecora with potions. That was the first thing I tried. I guess it just took some time to appear. But here it is!"
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,scootaloo,"This is awesome! We're not failures! Whatever we did worked! I had a feeling we could help you, and we did!"
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,Oh! We've gotta go see Twilight right away! She'll wanna know about this!
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,sweetie belle,Correction <U+0096> she needs to know about this! I bet she'll want to write a whole book about the very first griffon to get a cutie mark of her own!
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,gabby,"Oh, uh, totally! Um, but, you know, Rainbow Dash asked me to pick up her answer to Gilda's letter. I better take care of that before I forget. Heh. Here's an idea. Uh, y-you head to the castle, and I'll meet you there, cutie mark and all! Um... toodles!"
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,scootaloo,"Wow! Can you believe it? We were able to help her get her mark after all! Come on, Crusaders, let's tell Twilight!"
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"Gabby? You just missed her. She was in such a hurry, she didn't even come in. Just dropped this letter and zoomed away!"
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,scootaloo,"[reading] ""Dear Crusaders, I'll never forget you. You really are every bit as awesome as I'd heard. I'm heading home to tell all the griffons how you did the impossible by getting me my cutie mark. Toodles."""
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,Wait a second. Cutie mark?
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,You actually got a griffon a cutie mark for the first time in recorded history?! You know what this calls for? A full-scale research project!
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,sweetie belle,This makes no sense. Gabby didn't come in and show you her mark?
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,twilight sparkle,"You have got to get Gabby back here right away! I have so many questions! Oh, I hope I have enough ink and parchment to document everything! Spike! Guess what just happened!"
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,Weird. Gabby didn't show Twilight her mark like she said she was gonna do? Somethin' in this here applesauce smells kinda fishy.
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,scootaloo,"We'd better find her and find out what's going on. Come on, Crusaders."
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,scootaloo,"Keep your eyes on the skies, ponies. Gabby can't have gone far."
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,"She's not in the air. She's right there! Gabby! Hold up, we're a-comin'!"
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,sweetie belle,"Gabby, we're your friends. Why in Equestria are you running away from us?"
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,gabby,"Running away? Oh, I'm not running away. I'm just, uh, e-excited to show my lovely new cutie mark to everyone in Griffonstone!"
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,You mean the cutie mark that's runnin' right off your flank?
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,gabby,[defeated] Yup... That's the one. I guess the one thing I'm really not good at is faking things.
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,scootaloo,"Wow, Gabby. Painting on a fake cutie mark to make yourself feel better? You must have been really upset."
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,gabby,"Sure, I was disappointed. But I didn't do it to make myself feel better. I wanted to make you feel better."
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,gabby,I couldn't bear you three thinking you failed after you tried so hard to help. That's why I had to leave before you or Twilight found out the truth. [sighs] I'm sorry I wasn't honest with you. I'll just wing my way back to Griffonstone. Thanks for trying.
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,You don't need to apologize for carin' about how other ponies are feelin'.
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,sweetie belle,I'm just sorry we couldn't come through for you.
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,scootaloo,"Hmmm... Maybe we can. Gabby, clean up and meet us at the Crusaders' clubhouse!"
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,gabby,"I know you all tried your very best, but I guess griffons and cutie marks just don't mix. Maybe... I don't even have a special purpose."
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,scootaloo,"Hang on a second. We were racking our brains trying to figure out your destiny, until we remembered how every time you did something new, you tried to help everypony around you."
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,sweetie belle,"Even us. How did it feel when you showed up with that fake mark, and the three of us thought we'd actually helped you?"
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,gabby,Well... I was really glad I helped you feel happier.
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,scootaloo,So maybe helping is your thing! You might even say it's your purpose!
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,gabby,But helping just feels good. I-It couldn't have anything to do with what I'm supposed to do with my life... right?
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,scootaloo,"Gabby, finding your special purpose doesn't have to be about being good at something. It's about feeling good about something inside."
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,And it looks like your destiny is a whole lot like ours <U+0096> helping others. And you don't need a symbol on your flank to know that.
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,sweetie belle,"But since we are the Cutie Mark Crusaders, we made you one anyway. Behold!"
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,cutie mark crusaders,Your very own cutie mark! Ta-da!
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,scootaloo,We carved it to mark the moment we all figured out what you should do with your life.
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,scootaloo,"You bet we do! You're one of us now! Gabby, today we dub thee..."
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,cutie mark crusaders,The very first griffon member of the Cutie Mark Crusaders! Woo-hoo!
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,sweetie belle,You may not be able to get a cutie mark...
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,But you're selflessly dedicatin' your life to helpin' others anyhow. I can't think of anything more Crusader-y than that.
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,gabby,Awesome! My very own cute-cea<f1>era!
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,apple bloom,"Oh, land sakes! You sure have earned it."
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,sweetie belle,"And so have we! Scootaloo, you're pretty amazing. Even though things looked bleak, you still found a way to help Gabby in the end."
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,scootaloo,"'Course! Helping's what we do, right?"
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,gabby,"[laughing] I am so grateful! I'm gonna go home and do my very, very best to bring Cutie Mark Crusader values to Griffonstone! I promise."
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,scootaloo,"Promise us one other thing, too?"
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,cutie mark crusaders,Come back soon!
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,scootaloo,"After all, you're a Crusader now. Crusaders forever?"
The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Ed Valentine; story by Josh Haber and Meghan McCarthy,gabby,Crusaders forever!
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",applejack,The map is sendin' us where?!
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",fluttershy,Las Pegasus?!
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",applejack,But Las Pegasus is a wild vacation spot! It's just one big party!
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",fluttershy,"All those lights and sounds, not to mention the crowds... Oh, just the thought of it is overwhelming!"
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",twilight sparkle,"I know Las Pegasus doesn't seem like either of your cups of tea, but I have total faith you wouldn't have been called unless you were the perfect ponies for the job."
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",applejack,"Probably not as bad as we think. It can't just be a loud, obnoxious party all the time... right?"
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",fluttershy,"Uh, Applejack? It isn't as bad as we thought."
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",applejack,You're right. It's worse!
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",fluttershy,"Do you think the map could be on the fritz again? I mean, this place seems a lot more suited to Pinkie Pie or even Rainbow Dash."
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",applejack,"If Twilight trusts the map, then so do I. All we have to do is solve our friendship problem and get back home. 'Course, we have to find it first."
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",fluttershy,Wow. This Gladmane sure seems impressive.
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",gladmane,"Well, uh, it is a little embarrassing, but the crowds seem to like it. Uh-huh-huh."
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",applejack,Mr. Gladmane?
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",gladmane,Just Gladmane'll do. And it's a pleasure to meet actual cohorts of the Princess of Friendship! Thank you for coming. Thank you very much.
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",fluttershy,You know who we are?
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",gladmane,"I'm what you might call a friendship connoisseur, so naturally I'm familiar with the friends of the great Twilight Sparkle! Applejack, Fluttershy, it's an honor to have you here. Uh-huh-huh."
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",applejack,I have to admit you're not the type of pony I expected to find in Las Pegasus.
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",gladmane,"[laughs] Well, my guests may be looking for lights, music, and parties, but working hard and making friends is how I turned this hotel into what it is today, and how I plan to make it even bigger. Uh-huh-huh! Uh, excuse me for a second. [inhales] [through loudspeaker] Wise ponies may say the folks that come here are customers, but I can't help but thinkin' of each and every one of you as friends. That's why there's a three-for-one special on apple fritters in the cafe for the next hour! Enjoy! Uh-huh-huh!"
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",gladmane,Would you two like to take a tour of the place? I'm just about to do my rounds and check on my friends who work here.
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",fluttershy,[hushed] We do have a friendship problem to find.
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",applejack,"Lead the way, Mr. Gladmane!"
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",gladmane,"Just Gladmane now, you hear?"
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",gladmane,"New moves or not, I'm glad to have a star like you working for me, I'll tell you what."
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",gladmane,Stellar! Uh-huh-huh!
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",gladmane,"Now, don't make a fuss for ol' me. I'm just gonna keep on giving a tour to my new friends Applejack and Fluttershy."
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",applejack,Howdy!
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",fluttershy,Hi.
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",gladmane,"Aw, shucks. Well, let's leave the artists to their work."
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",applejack,[hushed] Doesn't look like there's any friendship problems here.
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",fluttershy,[gasps] I've never seen a pink prairie dog before!
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",gladmane,I like the folks that come here to have a unique experience. Uh-huh-huh.
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",fluttershy,Now this place is overwhelming in a good way!
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",gladmane,"Aw, glad you like it."
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",applejack,[clears throat] Fluttershy?
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",fluttershy,"Hmm? Oh, um, coming!"
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",fluttershy,There doesn't seem to be anything wrong around here at all.
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",applejack,I figured lookin' for a friendship problem in Las Pegasus would be like tryin' to find a needle in a stack of needles. But everypony seems to be gettin' along just fine.
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",flim,"Ladies and gentleponies, despite what my competition might say, I know you've come to this fair city to be entertained, and I assure you there is nothing more entertaining than the astounding acrobatics in Gladmane's Ponet Fantastique!"
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",flam,"Now, I suppose that might be true if it weren't for the existence, and far superiorly entertaining presence, of the show-stopping exotic animal act that Ponet Fantastique includes!"
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",fluttershy,Those voices sound familiar.
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",applejack,They sure do. Flim and Flam.
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",flim,"Why, I won't even dignify that assertion with a response! Except to say that if you were to consider buying your tickets from me, I might consider offering them to you at a substantial discount!"
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",flam,"But I've always thought you get what you pay for, and in my humble opinion, these tickets are a value at twice the price!"
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",flim,Don't let this price-gouging charlatan take you for a ride!
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",flam,[gasps] Charlatan? How dare you!
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",flim,Hah! How dare I?!
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",flam,"[simultaneous] Yes, how dare you! I was the one that..."
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",flim,"[simultaneous] I call 'em likes I see them, dear brother of mine!"
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",flam,"[simultaneous, background] I'm two minutes older than you <U+0096> don't you forget that, brother of mine!"
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",flim,"[simultaneous, background] I'm sick and tired of this..."
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",fluttershy,They certainly don't seem to be getting along. [gasps] You don't suppose we've been brought here to help them?
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",applejack,Absolutely not!
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",fluttershy,"I know you and the rest of the Apple family have had your issues with Flim and Flam in the past, but they're definitely having trouble, and solving a friendship problem is important, no matter who's having it."
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",applejack,"Well, of course that's true... for anypony but them!"
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",gladmane,"I'm sorry you had to see that. I don't know why, but those two have been fightin' ever since they got here. I thought giving them these jobs might help, but I... I guess it just made matters worse."
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",applejack,"Trust me. I know those ponies, and you're better off with them apart. The two of them together will cheat the hooves right out from under you!"
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",gladmane,"Yeah, I suppose you're right. Flim's such a showpony, and Flam has such a head for business. Why, if they ever did work together, they'd be running this place in two shakes! Ah, speaking of which, I'd better get back to work. Y'all enjoy your stay now, you hear?"
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",fluttershy,I'm pretty sure we should help Flim and Flam...
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",applejack,"And I'm pretty sure there's another friendship problem here, and I'm gonna search this resort top to bottom 'til I find it!"
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",flim,I hope you didn't travel all the way from Ponyville to try to get me to reconcile with my no-account brother.
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",flam,Brother? I don't believe I have one of those.
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",flim,"No! I already know what he thinks of me! All show and no substance! Well, if he's so smart, he should have no trouble becoming a big success on his own!"
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",flam,"""Ooh, why, he's the greatest salespony that ever lived, of course!"" Just ask him. He'll tell you all about it."
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",fluttershy,I'm sure you could work out your differences if you just sat down and talked to each other.
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",applejack,Shouldn't somepony do somethin'?
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",applejack,Heh-heh. Now that sounds like a real friendship problem!
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",applejack,I thought you two got along.
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",applejack,Two friendship problems in the same theater? Now we're talkin'!
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",fluttershy,"If you count Flim and Flam, that's three big friendship problems all in the same place!"
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",applejack,"Well, I don't count Flim and Flam since those two not bein' friends isn't a problem."
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",fluttershy,It certainly isn't for Gladmane. Sounds like he's better off with them fighting.
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",applejack,"Actually, the other ponies' problems seemed to be good for Gladmane too. Both the trapeze show and the animal act would be better off if they left, but everypony's so busy arguin' that they can't."
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",fluttershy,Do you think he knows?
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",applejack,"I don't know, but I'm startin' to think we should find out."
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",applejack,"I just can't figure it! The only pony who benefits from all this feudin' is Gladmane, but by all accounts, he's the best friend any of these ponies have!"
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",fluttershy,"Well, Bernard <U+0096> that adorable bunny from the acrobat's act <U+0096> claims that every morning, Gladmane tells the director that the star wants control of the show, and every afternoon tells the star that the director wants to get rid of her! But neither is true!"
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",fluttershy,And the Flying Prairinos <U+0096> the pink prairie dog family <U+0096> say Gladmane keeps changing their act to make each trainer think the other is doing it!
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",applejack,So all his talk about friendship is just a load of applesauce! He's gettin' them all to fight with each other on purpose!
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",fluttershy,But how can we get everypony to believe that's what he's doing?
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",applejack,There must be a way to trick him into telling the truth!
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",fluttershy,"Gee, if only there was a pony who knew how to trick a trickster."
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",fluttershy,Or maybe a pair of ponies?
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",applejack,[sighs] Fine. Guess bringin' Flim and Flam back together might be why we're here. Maybe.
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",flim,"Sorry if I don't take the word of somepony off the street, even if that street is in Ponyville."
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",fluttershy,But Gladmane is behind so many other friendship problems. How can you be sure he isn't the cause of yours?
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",flam,Because the only problem I have is standing right there.
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",flim,"Same here, buster!"
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",applejack,Do either of you even know what you're fightin' over?
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",flim,Gladmane let me know that ex-brother of mine thinks I'm just a mouthpiece without a single good idea!
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",flam,Gladmane assured me this former fraternal foal here thinks I couldn't sell heat lamps to yaks!
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",applejack,Sounds to me like neither of you said those things. Why'd you believe Gladmane when he said you did?
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",flim,Why would he lie?
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",fluttershy,Because he's afraid that the two of you together could move in and take over his resort.
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",applejack,"And if I'm tellin' you he said it, you know it's the absolute truth because<U+0097>"
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",flam,"Oh, brother of mine, I think it's time for a little payback!"
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",flim,The Canterlot Two-Step?
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",flam,"Mmm, we don't have the chickens. How about the Baltimare Flair?"
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",flim,"Ah, my flair isn't what it used to be."
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",gladmane,"[over loudspeaker] Listen here, y'all! If you're a friend of mine, you're entitled to a free night's stay, and everypony is a friend of mine! Thank you. Thank you very much."
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",flim,Are you thinking what I am?
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",flam,The High Roller Hustle!
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",applejack,The what now?
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",flam,"Trust us. When we're done, there won't be a pony in town who doesn't know the Applejack-iest truth about Gladmane! That is, assuming you two are willing to help."
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",flim,What size gown do you wear?
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",gladmane,"Wh-What's all the fuss, now?"
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",flim,"It's the grand matriarch of the Rich family, Impossibly Rich! She's one of the wealthiest ponies in Equestria."
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",gladmane,"Well, why didn't somepony tell me? You know how I like to give VIP guests my personal touch."
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",flim,"Well, she's not exactly a guest. Word is she's planning a resort of her own. [hushed] I think she's here to scout the competition."
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",gladmane,"[hushed] Oh, really?"
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",flim,"And with her bits, she could take over the whole strip, hire away anypony she wants!"
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",flim,"Uh, not me, of course! I love it here. My good-for-nothing brother, on the other hoof..."
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",gladmane,"[snorts] Impossibly Rich, what an honor it is to have you at my humble five-hoof resort. I'm sure Flam has done an excellent job showing you around, but nothing could beat a personalized tour from the mane himself. Uh-huh-huh."
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",flam,You'll have to excuse Ms. Rich. She saves the energy other ponies spend talking out loud and uses it to make more money.
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",flam,"She'd love a personal tour! Say, in, uh, about an hour?"
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",gladmane,"Well, that sounds right pleasant. And if you can break away for a moment, Flam, I'd love to see you in my office so I can get ready."
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",fluttershy,Are all of you sure this is a good idea?
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",flim,Abso-tively!
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",flam,Gladmane is one fish that's hooked but good!
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",applejack,I sure hope you two know what you're doin'.
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",flam,"Oho, don't you worry. When it comes to throwing ponies off their game..."
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",flim,No two ponies do it better than us!
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",applejack,Can't argue with that.
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",flam,"Hey there, boss, Impossibly Rich is just about ready for that tour. So what did you want to see me about?"
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",gladmane,"Actually, there's something I want you to see <U+0096> the Grand Plan. Every hotel on this strip as amazing as this one, and every one of 'em mine."
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",gladmane,"And all it'll take is a little salesponyship, like this."
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",gladmane,"[over loudspeaker] Hey there, friends. Uh-huh-huh. If you think my resort is fantastic, wait 'til you see Ponet Fantastique! Tickets are on sale now. Two for the price of one! Thank you. Thank you very much."
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",gladmane,Now I know Impossibly Rich has probably made you a tempting offer to come work for her.
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",flam,"Well uh, now that you mention it..."
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",gladmane,"And as your friend, I'd never tell you what to do. But nopony's gonna stand in the way of my plans, no matter how rich she is! And I sure wouldn't want you to end up on the losing side. Think you might consider staying here?"
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",flam,Um...
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",gladmane,Well all right then.
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",applejack,They're comin'!
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",gladmane,"And last but not least, Ms. Rich, the jewel in my crown."
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",flam,Impossibly wants you to know she's very impressed but doesn't think you can keep a resort of this caliber going for long.
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",gladmane,Oh? And why's that?
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",flam,Because you've got the best talents in the industry. What stops them from just leaving to join any competitor?
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",gladmane,"[laughs] Well, you see I have a trick for that, I must confess. Uh-huh-huh. And it all has to do [also over loudspeaker] with how I handle my employees."
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",flam,And how is that?
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",gladmane,"[also over loudspeaker] Well, like friends, of course! And I treat every one of my employees with the kindness they deserve."
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",flam,"[stammering] That's it? That's your secret, heh-heh? There's... [clears throat] ...nothing else?"
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",gladmane,"Nope, just friendship. But you know all about friendship, don't you... Fluttershy?!"
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",flim,You knew the whole time?
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",gladmane,Never try to con a con-pony. Uh-huh-huh. [laughs] Yeah!
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",gladmane,I'd have thought you'd have hit the road by now.
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",fluttershy,"Whether we were able to fool you or not, you can't just go on keeping ponies from getting along! It's just... mean!"
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",gladmane,"Now, maybe it is. But it's a meanness that works. Unlike your pathetic little ploy. I practically invented the ""High Roller Hustle"". But I suppose I should be impressed. You're the only ponies to ever figure out the secret to my success. Takes a lot of work keepin' everypony fightin'. But as long as I keep 'em convinced that I'm their only friend, all of Las Pegasus will be mine. Oh, you can't trick a confession out of a pony like me! I'm always one step ahead."
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",applejack,"Well, you better check your hooves, because you've just stepped in a confession!"
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",gladmane,"Oh, no. No, no, w-w-wait, wait!"
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",fluttershy,[over loudspeaker] Did that sound okay?
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",applejack,"[over loudspeaker] Flim and Flam told us you'd see right through the fake rich pony bit, and that once you did, you wouldn't be able to resist gloatin' about it! This was all part of the plan!"
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",gladmane,"Oh, now, now, friends! Listen, I-I can explain everything!"
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",applejack,Gladmane has left the buildin'!
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",fluttershy,I guess the map wasn't on the fritz after all.
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",fluttershy,"If it weren't for your history with Flim and Flam, you never would've been so determined to find somepony else to help, and we never would have found out what Gladmane was doing."
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",applejack,"And if it weren't for you wantin' to show even those two con-ponies kindness, we never would have been able to trick the trickster. [to Flim and Flam] Must've felt pretty nice to finally put all your connivin' and cheatin' skills to good use."
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",flam,"In fact, we might think of it as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity."
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",flim,"Emphasis on ""once""."
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",fluttershy,[suspiciously] What do you mean?
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",flam,"[over loudspeaker] While this establishment undergoes a slight change in management, my brother and I want to assure you that it remains the pinnacle of Las Pegasus entertainment! Which is why we invite each and every one of you to experience the wonder of the Ponet Fantastique Theater <U+0096> at half the normal cost of admission!"
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",flim,"[over loudspeaker] And while you're appreciating this historic venue totally devoid of any performers of any kind, we invite you to use the wonder of your own imaginations to fill the space at no additional charge!"
Viva Las Pegasus,"Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt; story by Michael Vogel, Kevin Burke & Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt",applejack,Flim and Flam!
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,twilight sparkle,"[yawns] I've prepared a full day of spells. You've been doing great, but now it's time for a real challenge!"
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,Oh-ho-ho! It is on! Where do we begin?
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,twilight sparkle,Teleportation! Multiple locations! Try to keep up!
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,twilight sparkle,Transfiguration!
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,twilight sparkle,Shields!
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,Whoo! I am on fire! What's next?
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,twilight sparkle,Maybe there is such a thing as too much studying.
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,"As you know, speed spells like Accelero are not easy. But if done correctly, they can allow you to be much more efficient with your day."
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,spike,"Way to go, Starlight!"
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,"[laughing] I'm not finished. I've discovered a very old spell, Similo Duplexis, when combined with Accelero in just the right way... [doubled up] ...you can literally be in two places at once! [normal] [sighs] Now I'm finished."
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,twilight sparkle,"I have to admit, your skills with magic really are nothing short of amazing. I'm very impressed."
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,[laughing] I've always been something of a natural.
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,twilight sparkle,"However, it doesn't look like you've tackled any friendship lessons since you met Trixie."
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,Are you sure? I could've sworn there were a couple in there somewhere...
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,twilight sparkle,I'm sure.
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,"I see... Well, I'm really quite busy this week. So many commitments. I'll try and find some time in my<U+0097>"
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,twilight sparkle,"No time like the present! Spike and I are headed to Canterlot. Princess Celestia wanted me to give her students a quick overview on the history of enchanted objects in Equestria. We'll be back after the presentation, which should be..."
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,spike,Twenty moons from now?
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,twilight sparkle,Tonight. It's a quick presentation.
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,spike,"[to himself] Sure, keep telling yourself that..."
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,twilight sparkle,"You can tackle a friendship lesson today, and we can review your progress when I get back later this evening."
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,[nervously] Of course! No problem! Friendship lesson... On it...
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,twilight sparkle,"Great! Can't wait. Now, Spike, help me color-code these cards according to time, place, and object."
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,"Huh? Huh! [humming and muttering to self] Oh, yeah. Mm-hmm."
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,spike,Hey! Twilight and I are about to head to Canterlot. Just checking to see if you need anything before we left.
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,"Nope, not at all! I'm good here. Oh, not good <U+0096> great! Not a problem in the world! Heh."
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,spike,"[disbelieving] Uh-huh. So... what are you doing, exactly?"
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,"I... was... just trying to decide which friendship lesson I was going to tackle while you two were in Canterlot. Bap-ba-du... Oh, yep, right here, where I just left them a second ago."
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,spike,"[blows] [reading] ""Bake a cake with Pinkie Pie,"" ""scrapbook with Applejack,"" ""sew with Rarity..."""
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,spike,"""Help an animal with Fluttershy,"" ""chillax with Rainbow Dash?"" What is chillaxing?"
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,No idea.
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,spike,"You know, uh, if you're nervous about your friendship lessons, it's totally okay to say so."
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,"Nervous, me? [fake laughter] Oh, Spike, you really are hilarious, ha-ha. You think I'm nervous that I'm gonna fail something as simple as baking a cake?"
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,spike,"Well, if you were, it'd be<U+0097>"
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,"Silly! Twilight just said how impressed she was that I combined a speed spell and a duplication spell. That was a challenge. These? Pfft, hah! I could combine all five of these at the same time without breaking a sweat."
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,spike,I think maybe you're missing<U+0097>
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,"An opportunity to really impress Twilight? [gasps] Great idea, Spike! I'm gonna get right on that! Good talk."
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,spike,And I thought Twilight was the master of the freak-out.
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,"So, with your help, I figure these should be done in no time."
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,applejack,Are you sure this is what Twilight would want? Seems like you might want to take your time with each of these.
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,"But by working as a team, we can get them done faster. And isn't teamwork a key factor in friendship?"
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,applejack,I... guess.
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,"Super! Pinkie Pie, since we're baking, you will be in the kitchen."
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,"Rarity, Applejack, you two can set up in the library."
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,rarity,"Oh, I don't know that a dusty old library has the proper lighting. Perhaps we can stay out here in the foyer."
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,I thought that Fluttershy and I could work with the animals right here in the foyer.
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,fluttershy,"Oh, um, whatever you think is best."
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,"Great. Now, Rainbow Dash<U+0097>"
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,fluttershy,"It might depend on the animal. For instance, this poor little eagle with a sprained wing might be better off up in one of the towers."
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure."
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,fluttershy,And these adorable little chipmunks might prefer a nook somewhere. Maybe if you spend some time getting to know<U+0097>
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,"In a minute, Fluttershy."
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,rainbow dash,"Uh, I don't know if we can chillax properly in the castle. We need very specific conditions for optimal chillaxing."
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,"Oh, I just assumed chillaxing could happen anywhere."
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,rainbow dash,Heh. Shows what you know about chillaxing. Let me do some location scouting.
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,"Okay... It seemed more efficient to start with the scrapbooking, so we can just get it out of the<U+0097>"
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,pinkie pie,"Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh! Can we start with me? We're gonna need time for the cake to bake! After all... It's a piece of cake to bake a pretty cake<U+0097>"
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,"Uh, we're on a schedule, no time for a song. We can start with baking, then<U+0097>"
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,rarity,But we can't design dresses after you've been baking with Pinkie. [hushed] She can be a bit messy.
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,pinkie pie,Mmm!
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,"Fine. We can start with the dresses, and then<U+0097>"
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,applejack,"While y'all figure that out, I'm gonna start layin' out the pictures for scrapbookin'. We got a whole lot of time to cover."
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,How much is a whole lot?
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,applejack,We've got at least eighty moons worth of memories to go through.
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,Eighty moons?!
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,rainbow dash,Ugh. There is nowhere to chillax in this castle! We're gonna have to set up somewhere else.
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,Could you all excuse me for... one... second?
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,rainbow dash,Wow. That pony really needs to chillax.
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,"[hyperventilating] Okay, Starlight. You've got this. A handful of friendship lessons is nothing compared to the spells you've mastered. [nervous laugh] Maybe if I cast a little spell to help things along... Something simple and safe. Fiducia Compelus... That's not bad. They would barely notice it, but... is it enough? Oh... Maybe Cogeria so they're more... open to suggestion. Oh, or maybe Cogeria combined with Fiducia Compelus! Yes, that could work nicely! Oh, with a hint of Persuadere to be sure it sticks."
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,Everypony'll probably thank me for getting it all done so quickly. And Twilight will be thrilled I've completed so many lessons. Everypony wins!
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,"Congratulations, Starlight. You're a genius. [gasps] Maybe the congratulations were a little premature..."
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,Cogeria... Persuadere... Fiducia... Hmm. Ah! Of course! Fiducia Compelus needs a trigger. [amplified] Ponies! Hear my voice and listen!
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,"Pinkie, kitchen. Rarity, Applejack, library. Fluttershy, stay here. Rainbow Dash, find somewhere inside the castle and set up a place where we can chillax."
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,"Let's get to work, Pinkie!"
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,pinkie pie,[mechanically] Okie-dokie! What would you like to do first?
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,"Uh, what are we supposed to do first?"
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,pinkie pie,"[mechanically] Whatever you want to do first, Starlight Glimmer."
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,"[reading] In a medium-size mixing bowl, beat together eggs, sugar, and two teaspoons of vanilla... [beat] mix in flour... [beat] [quickly] add baking soda, salt and cinnamon! Hmm. I think you can take it from here."
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,pinkie pie,[mechanically] Take what from where?
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,The baking. Just keep following the instructions in the book until I get back.
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,pinkie pie,[mechanically] Abso-tively! Instruction following starting... now!
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,Baking a cake <U+0096> check! Now on to sewing!
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,"What did you have in mind, Rarity?"
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,rarity,"[mechanically] Whatever you want me to have in my mind, Starlight Glimmer."
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,Can you make a dress exactly like that one?
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,rarity,[mechanically] Just like this one?
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,Just like it.
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,rarity,[mechanically] Absolutely. It will look perfectly divine.
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,That's a whole lot of photos. How do you usually organize them?
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,applejack,"[mechanically] However you want me to organize them, Starlight."
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,Okay. Tell me about this one.
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,applejack,"[mechanically] Sweet Apple Acres, twenty moons ago. Granny Smith was lookin' for her favorite pie tin. She looked in the kitchen, but it wasn't there. She looked in the barn, but it wasn't there."
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,Ugh. I don't need every little detail. Heh. Just sum up the story in one sentence.
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,applejack,[mechanically] Huh. Turns out Granny Smith didn't know how to make a pig do the backstroke.
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,"Uh-huh... Why don't you keep putting these photos in chronological order, and when I come back, you can give me more... highlights?"
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,applejack,"[mechanically] Sure thing, Starlight Glimmer."
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,"Fluttershy, where are all the animals?"
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,fluttershy,[mechanically] They ran away.
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,And why didn't you stop them?
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,fluttershy,[mechanically] Because you didn't ask me to.
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,Obviously I wanted you to... Never mind. Can you please round up all the animals in the castle and bring them back here to the foyer?
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,fluttershy,[mechanically] All the animals. Got it.

Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,rainbow dash,"[mechanically] Sure thing, Starlight Glimmer!"
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,Great. Let me know when it's ready.
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,rainbow dash,"[mechanically] Yes, Starlight Glimmer."
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,applejack,"[mechanically] Granny Smith knew she was gonna need a bigger boat, so Goldie Delicious says, ""If you can't say anythin' nice about anypony, come sit by me!"" Big Mac knew if he just covered himself in mud, the creature wouldn't be able to see him!"
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,rarity,[mechanically] Starlight Glimmer. I have finished the dress. Isn't it gorgeous?
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,What is that?
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,rarity,[mechanically] You wanted me to make a dress exactly like the one in the book.
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,"[sighs] Go make a real dress out of fabric, exactly like the one in the book."
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,rarity,"[mechanically] Ah. I see. Yes, of course, Starlight Glimmer."
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,Rarity! Make it bigger than the one in the book.
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,rarity,"[mechanically] Of course, darling. Bigger it is."
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,applejack,[mechanically] She was just a pony standin' in front of another pony askin' him to love her.
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,"Pinkie, what are you doing?!"
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,pinkie pie,"[mechanically] Following all of the instructions in the cookbook in order, Starlight Glimmer!"
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,I meant just the one cake! I was only gone a few minutes! How in Equestria did you get all of this done so fast?
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,Think the baking lesson is done.
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,"Oh, what now?"
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,applejack,"[mechanically] They can take our farm, but they can't take our freedom!"
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,What's going on?!
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,fluttershy,"[mechanically] I gathered all of the animals like you asked, Starlight Glimmer."
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,rarity,"[mechanically] Oh, yes, this will do nicely."
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,rarity,[mechanically] A much bigger dress!
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,applejack,"[mechanically, muffled] It was the best of apples, it was the worst of apples..."
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,"[exhales] I can handle this. It's just magic, and I know magic. What's that?!"
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,What did you say?
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,pinkie pie,[mechanically] The cakes are burning. You left the ovens on.
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,We need water!
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,rainbow dash,"[mechanically] Yes, Starlight Glimmer."
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,Storm clouds?!
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,applejack,"[mechanically] Big Mac told me, ""With a whole lot of power comes a heck of a lot of responsibility."""
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,[groans] This can't get any worse!
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,twilight sparkle,What is going on?!
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,spike,I had no idea we had spiders in the castle! I'm never sleeping again!
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,Maybe if I had reversed the Fiducia Compelus and Cogeria... Or maybe I added too much Persuadere... What?
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,spike,You're really missing the point here.
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,twilight sparkle,[sighs] I finally untangled that mess of a spell and got everypony home. It was really powerful stuff. They're gonna feel that in the morning. Now please try to explain to me how in the name of Celestia things got this out of control.
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,"Well, it was the first time I cast that particular spell, and I didn't fully think it through. I-I bet if I had reversed<U+0097>"
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,twilight sparkle,I think you might be missing the point here.
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,spike,Told ya.
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,twilight sparkle,What made you think that casting a spell on your friends to do your bidding was even remotely a good idea?
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,"Well, when you put it that way, it sounds really bad."
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,twilight sparkle,That's because it is really bad!
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,twilight sparkle,"Starlight, I'm not mad at you, but I am disappointed. You've been doing so well. I just don't understand how a friendship lesson turned into all of this."
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,"Ugh, fine! I've been avoiding the friendship lessons on purpose."
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,twilight sparkle,Why?
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,"I can cast complex spells, but baking a cake with Pinkie Pie freaks me out! And yes, I know how ridiculous that sounds. That's why I didn't say anything. I thought if I just kept wowing you with my magical abilities, you might just... not... notice?"
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,twilight sparkle,Baking a cake freaks you out?
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,"Yes! Baking a cake, sewing <U+0096> all of it! What if I was bad at it? I didn't want to be a disappointment to anypony, and I ended up being a disappointment to everypony."
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,twilight sparkle,"Starlight, do you think anypony cares if you can bake a cake?"
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,But the lesson<U+0097>
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,twilight sparkle,"Was to get to know Pinkie Pie better by doing something she loves. It was a friendship lesson, not a baking lesson."
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,"Oh. You know, I think I might have missed the point here."
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,spike,Told ya.
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,So now what?
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,twilight sparkle,Now it's time for a pretty advanced friendship lesson. It's called apologizing.
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,applejack,"[groaning] I don't know what kind of whammy Starlight put on us, but I feel like I got shoved through the Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000."
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,rainbow dash,"Ugh, tell me about it."
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,rarity,"[hushed] If everypony could speak in a whisper for the next few days, that would be delightful. My head is thumping...!"
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,fluttershy,[tired] I was up all night calming the animals down.
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,rarity,"[hushed] Fluttershy, please! Not so loud..."
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,pinkie pie,Starlight's spell made me burn perfectly good cake! I never burn cake!
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,"Yeah, about that... Things got a little out of hand last night."
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,applejack,"Well, ain't that the understatement of the day."
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,pinkie pie,"Hmph! Tell it to the cake, sister!"
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,rarity,[hushed] Can we all please argue at a lower volume?
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,I really messed up. I cast the spell because I was nervous about working with you on the friendship lessons.
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,rainbow dash,"Well, here's a friendship lesson for ya <U+0097> don't cast spells on your friends!"
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,"Believe me, I know. What I did was wrong, a-and I can't take it back. You're right to be upset, and I hope one day I can make it up to you. But all I can say is... I'm sorry. Now, if you'll excuse me, I've gotta go clean the castle covered in wet cake batter and spiders."
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,rainbow dash,That was a pretty good apology.
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,fluttershy,Seems like she feels pretty bad.
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,applejack,"Hey, Starlight! Most of the Apple family photos are still layin' around in the wreckage. I think I'll come along and hunt 'em down."
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,fluttershy,"Oh, and I feel awful for disturbing all of those cute little spiders and bats. I should check on them."
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,rarity,"Ah, yes, and I left some lovely fabric out. I should come and move it to that nice quiet library."
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,rainbow dash,"Uh, I'll come and get those storm clouds out of the bathroom."
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,pinkie pie,Fine! Somepony has to bake a cake to honor all the poor cakes that sacrificed their batter in last night's tragedy!
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,twilight sparkle,It seems your apology went well.
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,"[sighs] I'm just lucky to have such understanding friends, but it's probably going to be a while before I try to tackle those friendship lessons again."
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,twilight sparkle,What do you mean? You've been doing them all day.
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,What are you talking about? I've been cleaning up the mess I made by totally failing at friendship.
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,twilight sparkle,Really? But didn't I see you sewing with Rarity?
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,"Yes, but<U+0097>"
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,twilight sparkle,"And you and Applejack did a great job collecting those photos and putting them in the book. Helping animals with Fluttershy, baking with Pinkie Pie <U+0096> those sound like your assignments to me. In fact, I think there's just one that you're missing."
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,"Sun <U+0096> check. Chairs <U+0096> check. And thanks to a simple Catadupa Levitata spell, we've got water. Is that everything we need to chillax?"
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,rainbow dash,Nope.
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,No? What did I miss?
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,rainbow dash,Quiet.
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,Ah! Right.
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,rainbow dash,Hey! She completes the lesson when I say she completes it. So less learning and more chillaxing!
Every Little Thing She Does,Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,So... How long do we sit quietly?

Where the Apple Lies,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy & Dave Rapp,filthy rich,"[chuckles] Don't mind Spoiled Milk. She's just proud of me. Uh, but she's right. I'm in charge of the store now, and I'm just burstin' with ideas I wanna try!"
Where the Apple Lies,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy & Dave Rapp,young applejack,Like what?
Where the Apple Lies,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy & Dave Rapp,filthy rich,"Well, how 'bout this? Cider season's around the corner. Why not let me sell it for ya?"
Where the Apple Lies,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy & Dave Rapp,young applejack,That is an interesting idea.
Where the Apple Lies,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy & Dave Rapp,young big mcintosh,"Well, maybe it's interestin', an' maybe it ain't. But it's definitely not a new idea. Granny Smith told us your grandpa, Stinkin' Rich, used to ask her every year if he could sell our cider in your store, and Granny told him every year about the tradition of everypony in Ponyville linin' up out at Sweet Apple Acres."
Where the Apple Lies,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy & Dave Rapp,filthy rich,"So start a new tradition. Some day, one o' y'all will take over the farm just like I've taken over the store. I'm guessin' it'll the one with the best ideas."
Where the Apple Lies,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy & Dave Rapp,young big mcintosh,"Well, now, as I've said many a time before, ideas are all well an' good, but you can't plow a field<U+0097>"
Where the Apple Lies,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy & Dave Rapp,young applejack,"Ya know what? How 'bout we give you three barrels of cider early, and if it sells well, we'll make a deal for the rest?"
Where the Apple Lies,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy & Dave Rapp,filthy rich,"Oh, hey, now! Perfect! [to Spoiled Milk] Come on, honey. I've gotta get everything ready."
Where the Apple Lies,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy & Dave Rapp,young applejack,"Hoo-wee! I tell ya, if the future means me runnin' Sweet Apple Acres and you bein' quiet, I can't wait!"
Where the Apple Lies,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy & Dave Rapp,young big mcintosh,I just can't believe you'd make a deal with Filthy Rich without even talkin' to Granny!
Where the Apple Lies,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy & Dave Rapp,young applejack,"Aw, Granny will love the idea. And then she'll decide that I'm the one who should take over the farm. You'll see."
Where the Apple Lies,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy & Dave Rapp,granny smith,See what?
Where the Apple Lies,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy & Dave Rapp,young big mcintosh,"Applejack here had another one of her ""big ideas"", and I think we all know my position on ideas. You can't<U+0097>"
Where the Apple Lies,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy & Dave Rapp,young big mcintosh,Ee... right.
Where the Apple Lies,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy & Dave Rapp,granny smith,"Big idea, hmmm?"
Where the Apple Lies,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy & Dave Rapp,young applejack,"Actually, more of an opportunity. Y'see, we ran into Filthy Rich in town. Did ya know he's runnin' the family store now?"
Where the Apple Lies,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy & Dave Rapp,granny smith,"And what does this here ""opportunity"" mean for Sweet Apple Acres?"
Where the Apple Lies,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy & Dave Rapp,young applejack,"Well, uh, since cider season is almost here, he<U+0097>or, I-I mean, I<U+0097>thought it'd be a good idea to give him a few barrels of cider to sell at the store before the season starts."
Where the Apple Lies,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy & Dave Rapp,granny smith,"Oh, is that all? Absolutely not!"
Where the Apple Lies,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy & Dave Rapp,young applejack,"[scoffs] But, Granny, why can't we sell a few barrels o' cider early to Filthy Rich? And how is it any different than when you gave zap apple jam to Filthy's grandpappy to sell?"
Where the Apple Lies,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy & Dave Rapp,granny smith,"Your cider and your jam ain't the same thing! Zap apple jam jars preserve the flavor for moons, but cider starts to spoil the second it comes out the press. That is why every cider season, all of Ponyville lines up at Sweet Apple Acres. And first come is first served! Hmph!"
Where the Apple Lies,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy & Dave Rapp,young applejack,"I get what you're sayin', Granny. But couldn't you make an exception just this once? I sort of promised."
Where the Apple Lies,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy & Dave Rapp,granny smith,"Mm, meh-enh. Besides, cider-makin' is iffy business. And we're probably not gonna have a lot this year anyway, what with all the blight. I am sorry, Applejack, but you's just gonna have to un-promise."
Where the Apple Lies,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy & Dave Rapp,young applejack,[sighs] Oh.
Where the Apple Lies,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy & Dave Rapp,young big mcintosh,"I hate to say I told you so, Applejack, but<U+0097>"
Where the Apple Lies,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy & Dave Rapp,young applejack,You an' I both know you don't hate to say anythin'.
Where the Apple Lies,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy & Dave Rapp,young big mcintosh,"Well, I've always thought that the most important thing a pony can do is say exactly what's on his mind to anypony who'll listen, so everypony everywhere always knows everythin' they're thinkin', and<U+0097>"
Where the Apple Lies,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy & Dave Rapp,young applejack,And you don't ever have to listen to anypony else.
Where the Apple Lies,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy & Dave Rapp,young big mcintosh,What?
Where the Apple Lies,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy & Dave Rapp,young applejack,Exactly.
Where the Apple Lies,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy & Dave Rapp,filthy rich,"Well, if it ain't my new business partner!"
Where the Apple Lies,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy & Dave Rapp,young applejack,"Uh, about the cider, Rich..."
Where the Apple Lies,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy & Dave Rapp,filthy rich,Take a look at what I did last night after we made our deal!
Where the Apple Lies,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy & Dave Rapp,filthy rich,"Whoo! Ha! Pretty great, huh?"
Where the Apple Lies,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy & Dave Rapp,young applejack,"The thing is, I-I don't think I can get you any."
Where the Apple Lies,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy & Dave Rapp,filthy rich,"What? Well, I did all this work on your say-so! We shook hooves and everything!"
Where the Apple Lies,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy & Dave Rapp,young big mcintosh,"Well, you see, at Sweet Apple Acres, we've always been about quality, and while your basic jam jar'll keep<U+0097>"
Where the Apple Lies,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy & Dave Rapp,young applejack,"Plus it's been a tough harvest this year, what with all the blight."
Where the Apple Lies,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy & Dave Rapp,filthy rich,"Gah! Sounds to me like you're tryin' to make excuses! Whenever Granddad dealt with Granny Smith, she kept her word! If you can't do that, then maybe our families should stop doin' business together! Altogether!"
Where the Apple Lies,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy & Dave Rapp,young big mcintosh,"Now, now, the thing is, Rich, it ain't really up to us. Y'see, Granny's<U+0097>"
Where the Apple Lies,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy & Dave Rapp,young applejack,"Uh, sick!"
Where the Apple Lies,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy & Dave Rapp,filthy rich,"Wait, Granny's sick? I-I had no idea."
Where the Apple Lies,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy & Dave Rapp,young big mcintosh,Ee... yeah. Nopony did.
Where the Apple Lies,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy & Dave Rapp,young applejack,"Uh, what Big Mac means is, uh, we've been tryin' to keep it quiet. Don't want people to make rash decisions about doin' business with Sweet Apple Acres just because we're, uh, a little short-hooved at the moment."
Where the Apple Lies,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy & Dave Rapp,filthy rich,"Oh, my! O-Of course, of course! I am so sorry. Please let me know if there's anything I can do."
Where the Apple Lies,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy & Dave Rapp,young applejack,"Much appreciated. But right now, we-we only ask for your understandin' during this difficult time."
Where the Apple Lies,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy & Dave Rapp,filthy rich,Mm-hmm.
Where the Apple Lies,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy & Dave Rapp,young big mcintosh,"You were supposed to tell Rich the simple truth! But instead, you made things worse with a giant lie!"
Where the Apple Lies,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy & Dave Rapp,young applejack,"W-W-What was I supposed to do? You heard Rich. If I told him the truth, he was gonna stop doin' business with us altogether."
Where the Apple Lies,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy & Dave Rapp,young big mcintosh,"Yeah, but that's only because I... I forgot to ask if we had any oat crumbles for this delicious-lookin' salad, Granny."
Where the Apple Lies,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy & Dave Rapp,young big mcintosh,[hushed] That was only because you made promises you couldn't keep! But there's gotta be a better way out of this mess than by makin' up some story about Granny bein' sick!
Where the Apple Lies,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy & Dave Rapp,young applejack,"[hushed] Well, it worked, didn't it?"
Where the Apple Lies,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy & Dave Rapp,filthy rich,Sorry to drop by unannounced. We just wanted to come by to wish Granny a speedy recovery.
Where the Apple Lies,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy & Dave Rapp,young big mcintosh,"[sarcastic] Look, sis. Our good friend, Mr. Rich and his fianc<e9>e... are here. Oh, and they brought flowers! For Granny! On account o' she's sick! Like you said. Ain't that sweet?"
Where the Apple Lies,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy & Dave Rapp,young applejack,"Uh, excuse me one second!"
Where the Apple Lies,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy & Dave Rapp,granny smith,Aah!
Where the Apple Lies,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy & Dave Rapp,granny smith,"Golly, what in tarnation?"
Where the Apple Lies,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy & Dave Rapp,young applejack,"Oh, I'm sorry, Granny. I-I didn't see ya there."
Where the Apple Lies,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy & Dave Rapp,granny smith,"Ya came blastin' in so fast, t'weren't possible to see nothin'!"
Where the Apple Lies,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy & Dave Rapp,young applejack,"Can you go out to the barn? I, uh, I think I might've left a blight sprayer in the orchard."
Where the Apple Lies,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy & Dave Rapp,granny smith,"Are you outta yer apple-pickin' mind?! It's suppertime, girl!"
Where the Apple Lies,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy & Dave Rapp,young applejack,"I know, but, uh, if we forgot a sprayer, I'd wanna get it before dark. You go start countin', a<U+0097>and I'll tell Big Mac we'll be right back, okay?"
Where the Apple Lies,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy & Dave Rapp,young big mcintosh,"...so from that moment on, I took to referrin' to myself as Big or Large or..."
Where the Apple Lies,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy & Dave Rapp,filthy rich,"Oh, Applejack! Your brother was just explainin' why he always wears his yoke."
Where the Apple Lies,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy & Dave Rapp,young applejack,"Oh, well, you know how Big Mac can get to... to talkin', especially when he's upset. And right now, he's just as worried about Granny Smith as I am."
Where the Apple Lies,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy & Dave Rapp,filthy rich,"Oh, dear. Is she doin' that bad?"
Where the Apple Lies,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy & Dave Rapp,young applejack,"Well, one thing's for sure, she... she shouldn't be seein' anypony right now. In fact, I'm gettin' more upset just thinkin' about it. Excuse me."
Where the Apple Lies,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy & Dave Rapp,granny smith,D'oh! What in the frilly fumidil has gotten into you?!
Where the Apple Lies,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy & Dave Rapp,young applejack,"Sorry, Granny. I just decided if I helped you, it would go faster."
Where the Apple Lies,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy & Dave Rapp,granny smith,"Well, you're too late. All the sprayers are here."
Where the Apple Lies,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy & Dave Rapp,young applejack,"Oh, good. Uh, say, Granny, when did you first fight the apple blight again?"
Where the Apple Lies,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy & Dave Rapp,granny smith,"It was my second year here in Ponyville. Uh, they was before I had the rick on the one knee."
Where the Apple Lies,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy & Dave Rapp,young big mcintosh,"...and others say that's how the trees got to growin' so tall. But to me, it's just how I got my cutie mark!"
Where the Apple Lies,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy & Dave Rapp,young applejack,"Uh, Big Mac didn't wanna be rude, but you just can't see Granny right now, because she's... got apple blight!"
Where the Apple Lies,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy & Dave Rapp,filthy rich,[gasps] I thought only trees got the blight!
Where the Apple Lies,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy & Dave Rapp,young applejack,"Yeah, that's usually the case. [beat] The doctors think it's from workin' in the orchards for so many years. [beat] Y'see, we had to take Granny to Ponyville General. We just got back right before you showed up."
Where the Apple Lies,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy & Dave Rapp,filthy rich,"Oh, my. That is terrible!"
Where the Apple Lies,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy & Dave Rapp,young applejack,"Um, I'm sure you'll be fine, but you should leave... [coughs] ...just in case."
Where the Apple Lies,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy & Dave Rapp,filthy rich,You're right. We're gonna have to hurry if we wanna get there before visitin' hours are over.
Where the Apple Lies,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy & Dave Rapp,young applejack,That's right. Wait. Get where?
Where the Apple Lies,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy & Dave Rapp,filthy rich,"Why, the hospital, of course. I'm sure we'll see you there."
Where the Apple Lies,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy & Dave Rapp,young big mcintosh,Tellin' Filthy Rich that Granny's in the hospital just made everythin' a hundred times worse! What are we supposed to do now?
Where the Apple Lies,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy & Dave Rapp,young applejack,I got it!
Where the Apple Lies,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy & Dave Rapp,granny smith,"Dropped my second best teeth right in the pigpen, and that was the worst case of apple blight I have ever seen!"
Where the Apple Lies,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy & Dave Rapp,young applejack,"I'd love to hear more, Granny, but we gotta get to the hospital right away!"
Where the Apple Lies,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy & Dave Rapp,granny smith,The hospital? Why? Who's sick?
Where the Apple Lies,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy & Dave Rapp,young big mcintosh,"You are, apparently."
Where the Apple Lies,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy & Dave Rapp,young applejack,What he means is you're needed at the hospital.
Where the Apple Lies,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy & Dave Rapp,granny smith,Heh. Whatever for?
Where the Apple Lies,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy & Dave Rapp,young applejack,"It's the apple blight! It's startin' to infect ponies now! The doctors need an expert opinion, and nopony knows more about fightin' blight than Granny Smith!"
Where the Apple Lies,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy & Dave Rapp,granny smith,"Well, what in tarnation are we waitin' for? Let's go!"
Where the Apple Lies,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy & Dave Rapp,young applejack,"[gasps] You know, we're supposed to go in, uh, in the back! Uh, to avoid anypony in the waitin' room with the blight."
Where the Apple Lies,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy & Dave Rapp,young applejack,Oops! I almost forgot!
Where the Apple Lies,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy & Dave Rapp,young big mcintosh,Hrk!
Where the Apple Lies,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy & Dave Rapp,young applejack,This is perfect! Now you don't have to worry about catchin' the blight.
Where the Apple Lies,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy & Dave Rapp,granny smith,"[slightly muffled] If you say so, dearie."
Where the Apple Lies,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy & Dave Rapp,young applejack,"Now you wait right here while I, uh... check on your presentation!"
Where the Apple Lies,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy & Dave Rapp,granny smith,What in the rotten rhubarb is goin' on here?
Where the Apple Lies,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy & Dave Rapp,young applejack,[nervous laugh] Fancy meetin' you two here!
Where the Apple Lies,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy & Dave Rapp,filthy rich,"Well, I'm glad we found you, because I can't seem to find Granny's room or any nurses who've even heard about a pony with apple blight."
Where the Apple Lies,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy & Dave Rapp,filthy rich,"Uh, aren't you comin' with us?"
Where the Apple Lies,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy & Dave Rapp,young applejack,"Uh, I'll catch up! I gotta find Big Mac!"
Where the Apple Lies,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy & Dave Rapp,young applejack,"Okay, Granny, just wait here one second and we can go."
Where the Apple Lies,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy & Dave Rapp,granny smith,Where are you two going?
Where the Apple Lies,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy & Dave Rapp,young applejack,"Big Mac can't come! He, uh, might be contagious!"
Where the Apple Lies,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy & Dave Rapp,young applejack,"All right, climb up here and I'll cover you up. Then I'll bring Rich in, tell him you're Granny, but you're not allowed to take the sheets off. You moan a few times, he leaves, and this whole thing is over."
Where the Apple Lies,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy & Dave Rapp,young big mcintosh,"This is spinnin' way out of control, Applejack! Now I know you thought sellin' cider in Filthy's store was a good idea, but it ain't worth lyin' to him about Granny bein' sick and needin' to go to the hospital, or fibbin' to Granny about them wantin' her come here to talk about the blight, or<U+0097>"
Where the Apple Lies,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy & Dave Rapp,young applejack,"Big McIntosh, please just listen to me for once! This ain't about my ideas. If Rich finds out about all the lies, he'll cut off ties with us and the farm'll go under! Now do you want that to happen, or do you wanna help?"
Where the Apple Lies,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy & Dave Rapp,young big mcintosh,"Why can't you be Granny? You're her size, and this is all your fault in the first place."
Where the Apple Lies,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy & Dave Rapp,young applejack,"I would, but if I let you do the talkin', you'd just ramble on and on until we all got caught!"
Where the Apple Lies,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy & Dave Rapp,young applejack,"Just lay down, keep still, and promise me you won't say anythin' for once in your life!"
Where the Apple Lies,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy & Dave Rapp,young big mcintosh,[unconvinced] Eeeeyup.
Where the Apple Lies,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy & Dave Rapp,young applejack,Granny! [squeaks] [hushed] Granny!
Where the Apple Lies,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy & Dave Rapp,granny smith,It's about time! What is goin' on around here?!
Where the Apple Lies,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy & Dave Rapp,young applejack,"Uh, Granny, they need you to wait here! I'll come get ya!"
Where the Apple Lies,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy & Dave Rapp,filthy rich,[panting] There you are! We've been going in circles looking for Granny's room!
Where the Apple Lies,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy & Dave Rapp,young applejack,"Well, you're in luck, 'cause it's-it's right over here, and this time I'll make sure you don't get lost."
Where the Apple Lies,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy & Dave Rapp,young applejack,What in the dadgum<U+0097>?!
Where the Apple Lies,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy & Dave Rapp,young applejack,"He<U+0096> I mean, she was right here! Oh, no. We gotta go!"
Where the Apple Lies,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy & Dave Rapp,filthy rich,Where are they takin' her?
Where the Apple Lies,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy & Dave Rapp,young applejack,"You two, don't lose that gurney! [hushed] Granny, what are you doin'? You were supposed to stay there!"
Where the Apple Lies,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy & Dave Rapp,granny smith,It was a supply closet!
Where the Apple Lies,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy & Dave Rapp,young applejack,"Oh. Uh... Well, okay, come with me, but be quiet! You know, save your voice for the big presentation!"
Where the Apple Lies,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy & Dave Rapp,young applejack,But-but-but-but that's my brother on there!
Where the Apple Lies,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy & Dave Rapp,granny smith,Now apple blight is a serious disease!
Where the Apple Lies,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy & Dave Rapp,granny smith,"And once your trunk turns red like this, the only thing to do is prune the branches."
Where the Apple Lies,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy & Dave Rapp,filthy rich,"[gasps] Oh, no! Granny!"
Where the Apple Lies,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy & Dave Rapp,granny smith,"Well, sure! What else you gonna do once the blight gets this bad?"
Where the Apple Lies,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy & Dave Rapp,young applejack,"Everypony, just stop! This is all a big misunderstandin'! [pants] Actually... it's a big lie."
Where the Apple Lies,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy & Dave Rapp,granny smith,Big Mac?!
Where the Apple Lies,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy & Dave Rapp,filthy rich,"[gasps] Granny Smith?! What is goin' on here, Applejack?!"
Where the Apple Lies,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy & Dave Rapp,granny smith,That is a darn good question.
Where the Apple Lies,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy & Dave Rapp,young applejack,"[sighs] I'm not sure if I was worried that nopony was listenin' to my ideas or just nervous that I wouldn't be the one to end up runnin' the farm, but... I promised somethin' to Filthy Rich that I couldn't deliver, and I was too embarrassed to admit it."
Where the Apple Lies,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy & Dave Rapp,filthy rich,So Granny was never sick?
Where the Apple Lies,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy & Dave Rapp,granny smith,And there ain't no apple blighted ponies?
Where the Apple Lies,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy & Dave Rapp,young big mcintosh,Nnnope.
Where the Apple Lies,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy & Dave Rapp,young applejack,"Those were all lies. A-And I thought if you found out, you'd stop doin' business with the farm. So I just kept tellin' more."
Where the Apple Lies,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy & Dave Rapp,young applejack,Please don't make Granny and the farm suffer for what I did! This whole thing is my fault.
Where the Apple Lies,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy & Dave Rapp,young big mcintosh,"That's... not entirely true. Maybe if I paid more attention to what you had to say instead of talkin' all the time, none o' this would've happened in the first place. I just need to... talk less and listen more. Especially to you."
Where the Apple Lies,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy & Dave Rapp,young applejack,"[sighs] Thanks, big brother. And whether it's me runnin' Sweet Apple Acres or you, I know it'll be in good hooves."
Where the Apple Lies,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy & Dave Rapp,granny smith,"Well, that's nice, but I don't know what in blazes you two are talkin' about! I ain't goin' anywhere anytime soon! [blows raspberry] Runnin' the farm. Not after this display! Not likely! [to Filthy Rich] And don't you go gettin' any ideas about cuttin' ties with Sweet Apple Acres, or I'm goin' right to your grandpappy. Get me?"
Where the Apple Lies,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy & Dave Rapp,filthy rich,"[stutters] Um, yes, ma'am."
Where the Apple Lies,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy & Dave Rapp,granny smith,"Now, who here still wants to hear about the apple blight? Now, when I was a filly..."
Where the Apple Lies,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy & Dave Rapp,apple bloom,I can't believe you told all those lies!
Where the Apple Lies,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy & Dave Rapp,applejack,"It's not a story I'm proud of, but it taught me a lifelong lesson about bein' honest. I hope you learned somethin', too."
Where the Apple Lies,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy & Dave Rapp,apple bloom,I sure did. I learned that nopony starts out perfect and sometimes you gotta make a few mistakes to figure out who you are.
Where the Apple Lies,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy & Dave Rapp,big mcintosh,Eeyup.
Where the Apple Lies,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy & Dave Rapp,apple bloom,But I think the most important thing I learned is who really runs Sweet Apple Acres.
Where the Apple Lies,Dave Rapp; story by Meghan McCarthy & Dave Rapp,granny smith,You're darn tootin'! Now everypony quit your lollygaggery and get back to work! Right after we have a glass of cider.

Top Bolt,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, Joanna Lewis, & Kristine Songco",twilight sparkle,You should tell them. I'm sure they'd appreciate any notes from you.
Top Bolt,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, Joanna Lewis, & Kristine Songco",rainbow dash,Nah. I wouldn't want to mess with their confidence.
Top Bolt,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, Joanna Lewis, & Kristine Songco",twilight sparkle,But they'll never get better if they don't know what to work on.
Top Bolt,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, Joanna Lewis, & Kristine Songco",spitfire,"Sloppy wing placement, crooked lines... I'm gonna have to drill them on basic technique in the classroom portion."
Top Bolt,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, Joanna Lewis, & Kristine Songco",twilight sparkle,Classroom portion?
Top Bolt,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, Joanna Lewis, & Kristine Songco",spitfire,"Yeah, it's everypony's least favorite part of trial week, but it has to be done."
Top Bolt,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, Joanna Lewis, & Kristine Songco",twilight sparkle,Maybe we can help!
Top Bolt,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, Joanna Lewis, & Kristine Songco",rainbow dash,We can?
Top Bolt,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, Joanna Lewis, & Kristine Songco",twilight sparkle,"Absolutely! Between your flying skills and my teaching expertise, they could learn a lot! Plus, once they get to know us, they'll be more comfortable coming to us with their friendship problems!"
Top Bolt,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, Joanna Lewis, & Kristine Songco",rainbow dash,Count us in!
Top Bolt,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, Joanna Lewis, & Kristine Songco",spitfire,You have your work cut out for you.
Top Bolt,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, Joanna Lewis, & Kristine Songco",twilight sparkle,Thank goodness I had time to whip up a few charts on flight patterns and wing symmetry! It's fresh in my mind from when I learned to fly! This is so exciting!
Top Bolt,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, Joanna Lewis, & Kristine Songco",twilight sparkle,I'm pretty sure their thirst for knowledge will keep them bright-eyed and bushy-tailed.
Top Bolt,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, Joanna Lewis, & Kristine Songco",rainbow dash,"[chuckles] Good one, Twilight."
Top Bolt,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, Joanna Lewis, & Kristine Songco",rainbow dash,"Wake up, newbies! Class is in session!"
Top Bolt,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, Joanna Lewis, & Kristine Songco",twilight sparkle,"Hello, students! I'm Twilight Sparkle, and this is Rainbow Dash."
Top Bolt,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, Joanna Lewis, & Kristine Songco",rainbow dash,"But you can call us ""T-Sparks"" and ""The Dashinator""!"
Top Bolt,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, Joanna Lewis, & Kristine Songco",rainbow dash,[laughs nervously] Just kidding.
Top Bolt,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, Joanna Lewis, & Kristine Songco",twilight sparkle,And we're here to go over basic flying technique.
Top Bolt,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, Joanna Lewis, & Kristine Songco",rainbow dash,Who said that?!
Top Bolt,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, Joanna Lewis, & Kristine Songco",sky stinger,"Me. I mean, we're here because we're amazingly awesome crazy-good flyers. We're way past basics."
Top Bolt,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, Joanna Lewis, & Kristine Songco",rainbow dash,What's your name?
Top Bolt,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, Joanna Lewis, & Kristine Songco",sky stinger,"Sky Stinger. You've, uh, never heard of me?"
Top Bolt,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, Joanna Lewis, & Kristine Songco",vapor trail,He set the record for the fastest vertical acceleration rate! Five hundred feet in two seconds!
Top Bolt,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, Joanna Lewis, & Kristine Songco",rainbow dash,[unimpressed] Huh. That's pretty impressive.
Top Bolt,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, Joanna Lewis, & Kristine Songco",vapor trail,It's amazing.
Top Bolt,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, Joanna Lewis, & Kristine Songco",twilight sparkle,"[clears throat] It is, and we can talk personal records after class, Ms...?"
Top Bolt,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, Joanna Lewis, & Kristine Songco",sky stinger,Vapor Trail. She's my wingpony. I never fly without her.
Top Bolt,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, Joanna Lewis, & Kristine Songco",rainbow dash,But you'll have to in the solo trials.
Top Bolt,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, Joanna Lewis, & Kristine Songco",vapor trail,There are... [gulps] ...solo trials?
Top Bolt,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, Joanna Lewis, & Kristine Songco",rainbow dash,Yup. It's a part of your final evaluation.
Top Bolt,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, Joanna Lewis, & Kristine Songco",sky stinger,"[scoffs] We'll ace that test with our wings tied behind our flanks. My picture will go right up there, next to yours."
Top Bolt,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, Joanna Lewis, & Kristine Songco",rainbow dash,"That's a mighty big claim, considering everypony here is an amazingly awesome crazy-good flyer."
Top Bolt,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, Joanna Lewis, & Kristine Songco",sky stinger,I know.
Top Bolt,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, Joanna Lewis, & Kristine Songco",twilight sparkle,"[clears throat] Okay! Let's get back on track. Now, who can tell me the best wing angle to achieve minimal air resistance?"
Top Bolt,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, Joanna Lewis, & Kristine Songco",rainbow dash,[quickly] Wake up newbies! Class is in session!
Top Bolt,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, Joanna Lewis, & Kristine Songco",twilight sparkle,"Well, there were a few hiccups, but overall, that went pretty well."
Top Bolt,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, Joanna Lewis, & Kristine Songco",rainbow dash,"[cricks neck, yawns] Yeah, nopony fell asleep. What? I'm not a student!"
Top Bolt,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, Joanna Lewis, & Kristine Songco",sky stinger,"Hey, Teach!"
Top Bolt,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, Joanna Lewis, & Kristine Songco",rainbow dash,Me or Twilight? Probably Twilight.
Top Bolt,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, Joanna Lewis, & Kristine Songco",sky stinger,"Um, uh, both. About the solo test. I'm actually kinda worried about it."
Top Bolt,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, Joanna Lewis, & Kristine Songco",twilight sparkle,"Aw, that's all right. We all have moments where we doubt ourselves."
Top Bolt,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, Joanna Lewis, & Kristine Songco",sky stinger,"No, no. I've absolutely zero doubts about myself. I'm a strong flyer. Like, really, really, really strong. This isn't about me. I'm worried for Vapor."
Top Bolt,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, Joanna Lewis, & Kristine Songco",twilight sparkle,"Oh, well, that is very... kind of you?"
Top Bolt,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, Joanna Lewis, & Kristine Songco",rainbow dash,Tell you what. It's almost time for your freestyle training. Why don't you grab her and show us what you got?
Top Bolt,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, Joanna Lewis, & Kristine Songco",sky stinger,Yes! Prepare to be impressed!
Top Bolt,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, Joanna Lewis, & Kristine Songco",sky stinger,By me.
Top Bolt,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, Joanna Lewis, & Kristine Songco",sky stinger,"Like I said, Vapor still needs work."
Top Bolt,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, Joanna Lewis, & Kristine Songco",twilight sparkle,"Well, he may be full of himself, but I have to admit, Sky is an excellent flyer. He must have shot up two hundred feet!"
Top Bolt,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, Joanna Lewis, & Kristine Songco",rainbow dash,But did you see Vapor Trail? Her wing was under his. I think she gave him a boost.
Top Bolt,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, Joanna Lewis, & Kristine Songco",twilight sparkle,I guess I didn't even notice Vapor. I was too busy watching Sky.
Top Bolt,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, Joanna Lewis, & Kristine Songco",twilight sparkle,"[gasps] I think you're right! Vapor just created a gust of wind that caught Sky's wing at a forty-five degree angle, propelling him into a flipping loop! [beat] Somepony paid attention in class!"
Top Bolt,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, Joanna Lewis, & Kristine Songco",rainbow dash,Sky obviously has no idea he's not actually amazingly awesome.
Top Bolt,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, Joanna Lewis, & Kristine Songco",twilight sparkle,"And Vapor's so busy making her friend look good, she's not focused on her own flying at all. [gasps] This must be our friendship problem! And there's only one thing to do!"
Top Bolt,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, Joanna Lewis, & Kristine Songco",twilight sparkle,You don't want to tell them?
Top Bolt,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, Joanna Lewis, & Kristine Songco",rainbow dash,Of course not! Flying is like thirty percent skill and seventy percent confidence! You can't mess with a flyer's confidence!
Top Bolt,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, Joanna Lewis, & Kristine Songco",twilight sparkle,"But you can't improve if you don't think you have to! Besides, Vapor's keeping a pretty big secret from Sky, and that could lead to trouble!"
Top Bolt,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, Joanna Lewis, & Kristine Songco",rainbow dash,"Yeah, but if we tell them that they've been holding each other back, that could be trouble too!"
Top Bolt,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, Joanna Lewis, & Kristine Songco",sky stinger,"Ah, I nailed that flipping loop. I'm actually surprised you're still here. Thought I blew you away."
Top Bolt,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, Joanna Lewis, & Kristine Songco",vapor trail,"[out of breath] You were... great, Sky."
Top Bolt,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, Joanna Lewis, & Kristine Songco",spitfire,"Come on, Vapor Trail! You're gonna have to build up your endurance if you want a shot at the Academy! Wonderbolts don't get winded! Angel Wings, you call that cloud-busting?! That cloud barely knew you were there! I love my job."
Top Bolt,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, Joanna Lewis, & Kristine Songco",sky stinger,"We'll keep working, and who knows? One day, you might come close to being almost as good as me."
Top Bolt,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, Joanna Lewis, & Kristine Songco",sky stinger,You do have a really great sneeze.
Top Bolt,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, Joanna Lewis, & Kristine Songco",vapor trail,"Thanks, Sky, but I don't think I can sneeze my way into the Academy. [sighs] I'm pretty beat. I'm gonna hit the showers."
Top Bolt,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, Joanna Lewis, & Kristine Songco",sky stinger,You have to help her.
Top Bolt,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, Joanna Lewis, & Kristine Songco",twilight sparkle,"Actually, she's not the one<U+0097>"
Top Bolt,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, Joanna Lewis, & Kristine Songco",rainbow dash,Will do!
Top Bolt,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, Joanna Lewis, & Kristine Songco",rainbow dash,"Hey, you did great. You're a really strong flyer."
Top Bolt,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, Joanna Lewis, & Kristine Songco",vapor trail,"Uh, me?"
Top Bolt,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, Joanna Lewis, & Kristine Songco",twilight sparkle,"Vapor Trail, we know what you've been doing."
Top Bolt,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, Joanna Lewis, & Kristine Songco",rainbow dash,You've been doing great!
Top Bolt,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, Joanna Lewis, & Kristine Songco",twilight sparkle,[groans] You've been helping Sky!
Top Bolt,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, Joanna Lewis, & Kristine Songco",vapor trail,"Uh, I don't know what you're talking about! Sky doesn't need anypony's help. He's amazing."
Top Bolt,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, Joanna Lewis, & Kristine Songco",rainbow dash,[sighs] Not without you. And it's gonna be pretty obvious during the solo trials when he can't get enough air to do a flipping loop.
Top Bolt,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, Joanna Lewis, & Kristine Songco",vapor trail,"Oh, no! I can't let that happen! I mean, ah, uh... Aw, sugarcubes!"
Top Bolt,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, Joanna Lewis, & Kristine Songco",twilight sparkle,Why are you doing this for him?
Top Bolt,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, Joanna Lewis, & Kristine Songco",vapor trail,[sighs] It started when we were kids. You have to understand...
Top Bolt,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, Joanna Lewis, & Kristine Songco",vapor trail,"[narrating] ...Sky grew up with a lot of siblings. It was tough. He was always trying to get his parents' attention. Meanwhile, I was an only child who hated all the attention I got from mine."
Top Bolt,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, Joanna Lewis, & Kristine Songco",vapor trail,"[narrating] Flying together gave us both what we wanted! But I never told Sky how much I was helping him. It started with a small boost here or a little gust of wind there, but I didn't think my help could actually hurt his chances."
Top Bolt,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, Joanna Lewis, & Kristine Songco",twilight sparkle,I understand. But now you're both in trouble!
Top Bolt,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, Joanna Lewis, & Kristine Songco",rainbow dash,"You need to work on your tricks, and Sky needs to be able to fly without you or he won't make it."
Top Bolt,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, Joanna Lewis, & Kristine Songco",vapor trail,"Oh, but he has to! Flying with the Wonderbolts has been Sky's dream ever since he was a colt!"
Top Bolt,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, Joanna Lewis, & Kristine Songco",twilight sparkle,What about you?
Top Bolt,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, Joanna Lewis, & Kristine Songco",vapor trail,I... I guess I haven't thought about it. I just want to be with my best friend.
Top Bolt,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, Joanna Lewis, & Kristine Songco",rainbow dash,Then we have to find a way to help both of you.
Top Bolt,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, Joanna Lewis, & Kristine Songco",twilight sparkle,Starting with telling Sky the truth.
Top Bolt,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, Joanna Lewis, & Kristine Songco",vapor trail,"No, you can't! Sky will be crushed! And without his confidence, he won't fly as well!"
Top Bolt,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, Joanna Lewis, & Kristine Songco",twilight sparkle,[sighs] Then I guess we'll give Dash's method a shot.
Top Bolt,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, Joanna Lewis, & Kristine Songco",rainbow dash,"Yes! Hah-hah! I love being right! Okay, here's what we do. Sky needs to build his strength. Air drills, wing lifts, all that boring methodical stuff."
Top Bolt,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, Joanna Lewis, & Kristine Songco",twilight sparkle,Sounds like my cup of oats.
Top Bolt,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, Joanna Lewis, & Kristine Songco",vapor trail,But how will we get him to do that? He doesn't think he needs practice.
Top Bolt,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, Joanna Lewis, & Kristine Songco",rainbow dash,We'll just tell Sky that he should practice with Twilight so you won't feel so self-conscious about getting special training from me.
Top Bolt,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, Joanna Lewis, & Kristine Songco",vapor trail,With you? Really?! You'd do that for me?
Top Bolt,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, Joanna Lewis, & Kristine Songco",rainbow dash,Hah. You say that like it's not gonna be a blast.
Top Bolt,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, Joanna Lewis, & Kristine Songco",vapor trail,Whooa... Ah!
Top Bolt,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, Joanna Lewis, & Kristine Songco",rainbow dash,"Oh, you were awesome!"
Top Bolt,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, Joanna Lewis, & Kristine Songco",vapor trail,Really? Thanks! I can't believe I was able to keep up!
Top Bolt,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, Joanna Lewis, & Kristine Songco",rainbow dash,That's the first nice thing I've heard you say about yourself.
Top Bolt,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, Joanna Lewis, & Kristine Songco",sky stinger,"Hey, can we switch now? I want to do tricks with Rainbow Dash!"
Top Bolt,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, Joanna Lewis, & Kristine Songco",vapor trail,"You can't! I mean, uh, you're already so good at the fancy stuff!"
Top Bolt,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, Joanna Lewis, & Kristine Songco",sky stinger,"Heh. And the basic stuff. [beat] You're right, I don't need to practice at all."
Top Bolt,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, Joanna Lewis, & Kristine Songco",vapor trail,"Um, maybe, Sky, you should..."
Top Bolt,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, Joanna Lewis, & Kristine Songco",sky stinger,I'm already the best and everypony's gonna know it when I'm asked to join the Academy tomorrow.
Top Bolt,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, Joanna Lewis, & Kristine Songco",vapor trail,But not if you don't practice...!
Top Bolt,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, Joanna Lewis, & Kristine Songco",sky stinger,"Heh. I wouldn't be surprised if they asked me to become a Wonderbolt straight out of the trials. Boom, dream achieved."
Top Bolt,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, Joanna Lewis, & Kristine Songco",sky stinger,What did you say?
Top Bolt,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, Joanna Lewis, & Kristine Songco",vapor trail,"[sighs] Sky, I want you to get in as much as anypony, and you're amazing, but..."
Top Bolt,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, Joanna Lewis, & Kristine Songco",sky stinger,But what?
Top Bolt,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, Joanna Lewis, & Kristine Songco",vapor trail,I've been... helping you.
Top Bolt,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, Joanna Lewis, & Kristine Songco",rainbow dash,Gyuh...
Top Bolt,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, Joanna Lewis, & Kristine Songco",sky stinger,"[panting] How can you do this to me? Did you all know? Oh, great. So everypony but me knows I'm a joke. Was this your plan the whole time? To embarrass me?"
Top Bolt,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, Joanna Lewis, & Kristine Songco",vapor trail,What? No! Don't you know me at all?
Top Bolt,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, Joanna Lewis, & Kristine Songco",sky stinger,"I guess not, since it took me this long to find out you're a terrible wingpony!"
Top Bolt,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, Joanna Lewis, & Kristine Songco",vapor trail,[gasps] I can't believe you!
Top Bolt,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, Joanna Lewis, & Kristine Songco",sky stinger,I can't believe I was ever your friend!
Top Bolt,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, Joanna Lewis, & Kristine Songco",vapor trail,Thanks a lot.
Top Bolt,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, Joanna Lewis, & Kristine Songco",rainbow dash,Do you think they're still mad?
Top Bolt,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, Joanna Lewis, & Kristine Songco",rainbow dash,"Yeah, they're still mad."
Top Bolt,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, Joanna Lewis, & Kristine Songco",twilight sparkle,"This is all my fault. If we'd just done things your way, maybe we could have avoided this whole mess."
Top Bolt,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, Joanna Lewis, & Kristine Songco",rainbow dash,"No, it's my fault. It hit me when I was watching Sky train with you. He wasn't even trying!"
Top Bolt,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, Joanna Lewis, & Kristine Songco",rainbow dash,"Oh, no. He's lost his confidence."
Top Bolt,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, Joanna Lewis, & Kristine Songco",spitfire,Do you want to tell me why one of my most promising students is flying like a balloon with a hole in it?!
Top Bolt,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, Joanna Lewis, & Kristine Songco",rainbow dash,"Uh, it's a long story, but we'll fix it."
Top Bolt,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, Joanna Lewis, & Kristine Songco",rainbow dash,"[groans] We really messed up, huh?"
Top Bolt,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, Joanna Lewis, & Kristine Songco",twilight sparkle,I have a plan.
Top Bolt,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, Joanna Lewis, & Kristine Songco",twilight sparkle,"Hey, Sky. I thought I might find you here."
Top Bolt,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, Joanna Lewis, & Kristine Songco",sky stinger,"Well, apparently, I need a lot of practice. Guess I'm not the natural I thought I was."
Top Bolt,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, Joanna Lewis, & Kristine Songco",twilight sparkle,"No, you're not."
Top Bolt,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, Joanna Lewis, & Kristine Songco",sky stinger,[sarcastic] Thanks. Good pep talk.
Top Bolt,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, Joanna Lewis, & Kristine Songco",twilight sparkle,"I wasn't a natural at friendship. But with some practice and help from my friends, I got better, and now I'm the Princess of Friendship!"
Top Bolt,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, Joanna Lewis, & Kristine Songco",sky stinger,So you're saying I can be the... Princess of Flying?
Top Bolt,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, Joanna Lewis, & Kristine Songco",rainbow dash,"You know, you're really good. You're lead pony material."
Top Bolt,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, Joanna Lewis, & Kristine Songco",vapor trail,"Hm. That's sweet of you, but no. I couldn't handle all the attention."
Top Bolt,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, Joanna Lewis, & Kristine Songco",rainbow dash,"But you'll never become a Wonderbolt if you're too afraid to shine. That is what you want, right?"
Top Bolt,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, Joanna Lewis, & Kristine Songco",vapor trail,"Well, not at first. I just wanted to be with Sky. But learning to do all those fun tricks with you? It made me realize this is something I want for myself!"
Top Bolt,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, Joanna Lewis, & Kristine Songco",rainbow dash,I was hoping you'd say that. Come with me.
Top Bolt,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, Joanna Lewis, & Kristine Songco",sky stinger,What's she doing here?
Top Bolt,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, Joanna Lewis, & Kristine Songco",rainbow dash,"Sky, Vapor was never trying to steal your spotlight. She thought she was helping you."
Top Bolt,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, Joanna Lewis, & Kristine Songco",twilight sparkle,"And Vapor, you shouldn't have been so content to take a back seat."
Top Bolt,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, Joanna Lewis, & Kristine Songco",rainbow dash,"Now, you can either stay mad, or help each other and become two of the greatest flyers the Wonderbolt Academy has ever seen! [beat] Please pick the second option. I don't want Spitfire to be mad at me."
Top Bolt,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, Joanna Lewis, & Kristine Songco",vapor trail,"You got this, Sky!"
Top Bolt,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, Joanna Lewis, & Kristine Songco",sky stinger,Focus on a cloud when you spin! It'll help you fly straight when you come out of it!
Top Bolt,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, Joanna Lewis, & Kristine Songco",vapor trail,Uh-huh!
Top Bolt,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, Joanna Lewis, & Kristine Songco",spitfire,Congratulations! You've both made it into the Wonderbolt Academy!
Top Bolt,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, Joanna Lewis, & Kristine Songco",spitfire,"Whatever you did, it worked. They still have a lot of potential. Who knows? They might even be better than you, Crash."
Top Bolt,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, Joanna Lewis, & Kristine Songco",rainbow dash,"[laughing] Okay, let's not get carried away."
Top Bolt,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, Joanna Lewis, & Kristine Songco",rainbow dash,"Hey, I heard that!"
Top Bolt,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, Joanna Lewis, & Kristine Songco",vapor trail,I can't believe we did it!
Top Bolt,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, Joanna Lewis, & Kristine Songco",sky stinger,"You were great! Even though you can out-fly me, you can be my wingpony anytime."
Top Bolt,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, Joanna Lewis, & Kristine Songco",vapor trail,Aw. [chuckles] And you can be mine.
Top Bolt,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, Joanna Lewis, & Kristine Songco",twilight sparkle,Phew. It's good to be home.
Top Bolt,"Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco; story by Meghan McCarthy, Joanna Lewis, & Kristine Songco",rainbow dash,"[sighs] You're telling me. Now we can finally catch up with some Daring Do, I can make cider with Applejack<U+0097>"
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,spike,"[grunting, yelps] Well, we don't all have magical horns."
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,twilight sparkle,I've been meaning to move these older books to my reference section for a while. Got to keep the new books front and center! Thank you both for your help.
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,"Are you kidding? After all you've done for me, this is the least I can do."
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,twilight sparkle,"Oh, please. I haven't done that much."
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,Nah. You just taught me the value of friendship. Not much at all.
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,twilight sparkle,"I may have offered some guidance, but you are responsible for the pony you've become. I'm proud to call you my student and my friend. Now we just need to get rid of these boxes. Spike, can you<U+0097>? Spike?"
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,spike,What's that?
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,twilight sparkle,Is it a bird?
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,Is it a parasprite?
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,spike,It's... it's... incoming!
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,twilight sparkle,Oh. I usually get letters by dragon.
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,spike,It is the fastest way to get mail!
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,For me? Who'd be sending me a letter? It's... the ponies from my old village.
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,twilight sparkle,Are they in danger?
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,spike,Are they upset with you?
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,No... It's worse! They've invited me to the annual Sunset Festival!
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,"[exhales] Uh, hey there, everypony."
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,I-I... I was invited. To the Sunset Festival?
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,double diamond,"Uh, yeah, but we didn't think you'd actually show up."
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,But... I... apologized. I thought everything was fine.
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,Please...! Stop...! Stop!
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,What happened? Is anypony there? Princess Luna? W-What are you doing here?
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,princess luna,"Dreams are my domain, Starlight Glimmer. I am here because you need me to be."
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,Oh. It's only a dream.
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,princess luna,"It may only be a dream, but the feelings in it are real."
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,[sighs] Great. So I guess I'm more afraid of going back to the village than I thought. What do I do now?
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,princess luna,"I have been helped time and time again by six very special ponies. They helped me overcome my past. You're fortunate to have them as friends. I suggest you share your concerns with them. I see much of myself in you, Starlight Glimmer, and I can tell you from personal experience that things do indeed get better."
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,...and Princess Luna said I should tell you all how I was feeling. So... there it is. I'm afraid to go back to the village for the celebration.
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,rarity,"But why, darling? You went back to apologize. They accepted. Everypony has moved on."
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,"But have they? They don't really know how much I've changed. Or even worse, maybe I haven't changed as much as I think I have!"
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,rainbow dash,"Trust me. You are a totally different pony now. I mean, you were pretty awful."
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,applejack,Rainbow Dash!
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,rainbow dash,What? She was! It's a compliment!
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,fluttershy,I don't think they would've sent the invitation if they didn't want you to come. I'm sure they'd be happy to see you.
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,pinkie pie,"And getting an invitation to a party and not going?! That's like... I-It's like...! Well, I don't know what it's like, but it is definitely bad."
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,applejack,Just be honest with them. I'm sure they'll understand where you're comin' from.
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,twilight sparkle,"I understand how hard this is for you. Maybe if you took a friend along, it might make things easier. Somepony you trust who would look out for you?"
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,"Thanks so much for doing this, Trixie. When Twilight said I should bring a friend, you were the first pony I thought of."
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,trixie,"Great idea, Princess Twilight. Asking me <U+0096> Starlight's best friend <U+0096> to help her on this difficult journey really shows how wise a princess you have become."
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,twilight sparkle,"[through gritted teeth] Thanks, Trixie. [hushed, to Spike] I was talking about me."
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,"The festival lasts a whole week, but I'm sure we won't stay that long."
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,trixie,There it is! The town where you<U+0097>
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,"Magically stole everypony's cutie marks, replaced them with equal signs, and forced them all to hide their natural talents? Yes."
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,trixie,"I was going to say where you came from, but yours is a more... emotionally traumatic answer."
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,[sighs] I just want to... blend in. Be just another pony in the crowd enjoying the Sunset Festival with my friend.
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,trixie,"Sounds good to me! And if things get weird for you, just let me know. I've got your flank."
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,Is that a promise?
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,trixie,Not just a promise. A great and powerful promise!
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,"Well, I couldn't ask for more than that. If we're gonna do this, let's do it."
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,double diamond,"Oh! Starlight, you came!"
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,sugar belle,How is it living in a castle?
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,double diamond,It is so<U+00A0>good to see you!
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,"[small groan] It's good to see all of you, too."
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,"O-Oh, you don't need me to decide that. Heh. Whatever you think is probably best."
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,double diamond,"Uh, well, how about helping us with the routes for the relay races tomorrow? Can you take a look?"
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,"Oh, I-I shouldn't. You all go ahead. I-I just want to enjoy the festival."
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,sugar belle,"But you will be a judge for the baking competition, right?"
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,double diamond,We had a few questions about the order of the acts for the talent show.
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,trixie,"The Great and Powerful Trixie would like to thank you all for being such an amazing audience. Sadly, it is time for us to depart. Good night, fillies and gentlefoals!"
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,"Ugh! I was horrible when I led that town! I was ready for them to not trust me, but... I wasn't ready for them to put me in charge again! With my past, I should never be in charge of anything!"
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,trixie,"So you messed up. Big deal. [hushed] Don't you ever tell another pony I said this, but even Trixie's made mistakes. [giggles] I know! The trick is to just move on and pretend they never happened."
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,I feel like that's almost good advice.
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,"Hey, uh, Pinkie Pie!"
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,pinkie pie,Hey... [beat] you!
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,So... you're probably wondering why I'm back so soon.
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,pinkie pie,Where were you?
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,I... went to my old village? For the festival?
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,pinkie pie,"Ooh, sounds fun! How was it?"
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,It was kind of a disaster. I came back early because I freaked out!
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,pinkie pie,"Ooh, sounds awful! Bye!"
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,That was... strange.
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,trixie,Isn't she always strange?
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,"Yeah, but not like that. Hey! I'm back early."
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,rarity,Ah. Welcome back?
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,Have you two noticed Pinkie acting a little strange?
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,applejack,Pinkie Pie always acts strange.
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,trixie,Told you.
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,"Anyway, I wanted to talk to all of you. Things didn't go the way I thought they were going to go at the Sunset Festival."
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,rarity,What happened?
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,I kind of freaked out and ran out of the village.
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,applejack,You freaked out and ran away from a festival? Ha! That's the funniest danged thing I've heard all day.
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,rarity,[laughing] Oh my. Let me guess. The decorations were terrifying!
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,fluttershy,[whispering] ...Applejack for friendship business.
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,rainbow dash,"Hello, ponies. We need Rarity and Applejack. Very important friendship business."
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,trixie,"I have to say, I'm really not as impressed with your friends as the rest of Equestria is."
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,I need to talk to Twilight!
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,Twilight? Hello?
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,spike,What do you want? Twilight's very busy!
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,"Spike, I really need to speak with her."
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,spike,"Make an appointment! She's a princess, after all!"
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,What's wrong with you? Why are you being so<U+0097>
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,twilight sparkle,Rude? I think a certain dragon didn't get his nap today.
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,spike,"Yeah, right. Whatever."
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,twilight sparkle,Sorry. He's been acting a little off all day. I think he missed a meal or something.
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,He's not the only one. Everypony's acting a little strange today.
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,twilight sparkle,"Yes, it's definitely been one of those days! How are you?"
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,"Not great, actually. You're probably wondering why I'm back from the village so early."
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,twilight sparkle,"I didn't want to bring it up, but yeah, it did seem strange. Did it not go well?"
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,"The townsponies kept asking me things, like they expected me to be in charge again. But being a leader is the last thing I should ever be. So we left. Very suddenly. In a literal puff of smoke."
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,twilight sparkle,"Wow, you should definitely never go back to that village."
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,What?
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,twilight sparkle,"If you were worried about what they thought of you before, it's probably way worse now. I'd cut my losses."
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,"That's... surprising advice, coming from you."
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,twilight sparkle,Trust me. I'm the Princess of Friendship. You don't need those ponies. You can always make more friends.
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,twilight sparkle,"Ah! Speaking of friends, if you'll excuse me, important business to attend to!"
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,Cut my losses? That can't be right.
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,"Hey, I wanted to apologize for my behavior earlier. Party Favor, can you hear me?"
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,twilight sparkle,I told you you can never speak to them again!
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,What are you all doing here?
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,twilight sparkle,"Making sure you do what I said! I'm your teacher, aren't I? Didn't I say to never come back here?!"
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,"Yes, but that just doesn't seem right. You aren't acting like yourself."
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,A dream? This is another dream!
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,princess luna,[whispering] Starlight Glimmer...!
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,Princess Luna?
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,princess luna,Starlight Glimmer!
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,"Princess Luna, where are you?"
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,princess luna,"Starlight Glimmer, there is no time! You must get help!"
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,What? What are you talking about? This is just a dream!
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,princess luna,"Not here! In the waking world! They've taken my sister and I! It's worse than the last time! Your dream called to me, and I was able to break through! You must find help!"
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,What are you saying?! Who's taken you?!
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,Princess Luna!
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,[panting] They're back!
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,"Trixie? Trixie, it's Starlight! Are you awake?"
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,trixie,"[muffled, bleary] Of course, Princess Celestia... I'd love to perform for peanut butter crackers..."
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,"Trixie, wake up!"
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,trixie,[coughing] [tired] Starlight? What time is it?
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,It's late. I think I figured out what's wrong with my friends!
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,trixie,[yawning] I have a whole list of things that are wrong with your friends. We can go over it in the morning.
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,"No, Trixie, we're in danger!"
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,trixie,"[sighs] Okay, fine! Aside from lack of sleep, how are we in danger?"
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,I think the<U+0097>! [beat] What did you tell me never to tell another pony?
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,trixie,"Starlight, if you woke me up to play guessing games<U+0097>"
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,"After we left my village, what did you tell me to never tell another pony you said?"
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,trixie,[sighs] [through very gritted teeth] That even Trixie's made mistakes.
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,"Trixie, there's no time for this! What did you say?"
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,trixie,That even Trixie's made mistakes! Okay? Are you happy?!
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,[sighs] Yes. Sorry. I just had to make sure you weren't... [hushed] one of them!
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,trixie,[hushed] One of who?
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,A changeling! I think they've taken Princess Celestia and Princess Luna!
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,trixie,"What?! Are you sure?! I mean, what do we<U+0097>? We have to tell Twilight!"
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,"If I'm right, then it's too late for that."
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,twilight sparkle,Is it ready?
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,applejack,Just one more.
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,Queen Chrysalis!
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,queen chrysalis,Ugh. I can't take any of you seriously when you look like that.
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,twilight sparkle,"Oh, right."
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,queen chrysalis,Much better. Now report!
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,queen chrysalis,Excellent. And I've just received word that the princesses from Canterlot have successfully been replaced as well.
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,trixie,[panting] I can't deal with this! I'm just a performer! This is... This is princess-level stuff! But the changelings have all the princesses... We're doomed!
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,"Maybe not. Uh, Queen Chrysalis only said they took Luna and Celestia and obviously Twilight and the others... but maybe Cadance is still safe. Our best bet is to get to the Crystal Empire before the changelings do. That way we can<U+0097>"
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,thorax,There's no help coming from the Crystal Empire.
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,Thorax?
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,thorax,Yes.
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,Your wings look... different.
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,thorax,I guess they do.
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,How do I know you aren't some other changeling pretending to be Thorax?
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,thorax,You were there when Spike defended me to the ponies of the Crystal Empire. Princess Twilight said<U+0097>
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,thorax,"As the Princess of Friendship, I should set an example for all of Equestria. But today it was Spike who taught me<U+0097>"
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,"Okay, okay. I believe you. We don't need the whole speech."
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,"Trixie, this is Thorax. He's a reformed changeling. He's on our side. Understand?"
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,thorax,Hi. It's a pleasure to...
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,trixie,"If Starlight says you're on our side, I believe her. But maybe just stay over there for now, okay?"
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,What did you mean there's no help? Did the changelings get Cadance too?
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,thorax,"They took Cadance, Shining Armor, and Flurry Heart! Sunburst sent me here to get Princess Twilight's help, but... but it sounds like it's too late for that, too! So... what should we do?"
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,trixie,"Yeah, Starlight. What are we gonna do?"
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,I... I don't know! There has to be somepony else who can handle this?
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,trixie,There is nopony else! Everypony with powerful magic is already gone!
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,discord,"You know whenever ponies talk about powerful magic, they always leave me out. If I weren't so evolved, I might decide to take it personally. Well, isn't this quite the combination of secondary characters? Where are Twilight and the girls?"
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,"First, how do we know that you're really you?"
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,discord,Shall I continue?
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,"Chrysalis and the changelings are back. They've ponynapped all of the most powerful ponies in Equestria! Celestia, Luna, Cadance, Shining Armor, Flurry Heart, Twilight and her friends. We need to<U+0097>"
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,discord,[hushed] They took Fluttershy?
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,Yes!
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,discord,[menacingly] Where?
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,"The Changeling Kingdom. With you on our side, I can<U+0097>"
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,discord,"Odd. I was trying to take us right to Fluttershy, but there is no Fluttershy."
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,trixie,[whimpers] I think I have a pretty good idea where she might be...
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,thorax,I'd hoped never to see that place again. Now what?
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,It's... the ponies from my old village.
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,Oh. It's only a dream.
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,"With my past, I should never be in charge of anything!"
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,princess luna,They've taken my sister and I! It's worse than the last time!
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,Chrysalis and the changelings are back. They've ponynapped all of the most powerful ponies in Equestria!
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,...this is Thorax. He's a reformed changeling.
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,discord,[hushed] They took Fluttershy?
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,trixie,[whimpers] I think I have a pretty good idea where she might be...
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,discord,"Oh, this is so strange. We're here and that's there, and I clearly meant for us to be there and not here."
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,thorax,"Oh, I-I can probably explain<U+0097>"
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,discord,"Oh, well. If at first you don't succeed..."
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,Maybe we should come up with a plan first?
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,discord,[blows] A what?
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,trixie,"You know, figuring out the best way to do something before you actually do it."
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,discord,"[laughs] Oh, that's adorable. But you see, unlike you, I can do anything."
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,thorax,"Uh, actually<U+0097>"
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,discord,"That's all very nice, but really a waste of time. We have me. And what else could we possibly need?"
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,trixie,A draconequus with magic and half a brain might help.
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,discord,"Why are you here again? I mean, it's not like you're going to stop the changelings by pulling a rabbit out of a hat. At least my magic can do something."
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,thorax,The thing about magic here is<U+0097>
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,thorax,I've been trying to tell you! Nothing other than changeling magic works here. Chrysalis' throne is carved from an ancient dark stone that soaks up outside magic the same way changelings soak up love. It's how she keeps the hive safe.
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,trixie,"[to Starlight] So, uh, what kind of plan were you thinking?"
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,"Without magic, I have no idea. But nopony else is coming. So somepony better come up with something."
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,"Anypony? Anything? Hmm. This throne <U+0096> if we get into the hive and destroy it, can we get our magic back?"
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,thorax,Uh-huh!
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,discord,"Well, that's a terrible plan. How are we even supposed to get to the hive?"
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,trixie,We walk.
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,discord,I haven't walked that far in a millennia!
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,discord,"Oh, I don't know how any of you manage not being able to disappear and reappear whenever you want!"
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,trixie,"Well, I, for one, definitely miss you being able to disappear!"
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,Give Discord a break. None of us knew we weren't going to be able to use magic.
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,thorax,I did.
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,"If we get separated, it might make sense to have a way to make sure we are who we say we are."
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,trixie,"How about if we say ""klutzy"" and you say ""draconequus""?"
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,"""Klutzy draconequus"". Works for me."
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,thorax,I'll definitely remember it.
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,trixie,Okay. I am definitely glad you came. I don't think we'd be able to find our way without you.
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,thorax,You definitely wouldn't.
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,trixie,"Um, where's the way out?"
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,thorax,"It's a changeling hive. It shifts and changes like we do, and we're the only ones who can navigate it. It's total chaos to non-changelings."
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,discord,"Well, it's decent chaos. I don't know if I'd call it ""total""."
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,discord,Are we sure that I'll get my magic back when we destroy this throne thingy?
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,"If Thorax is right, then yes."
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,discord,"[sarcastic] Well, that's reassuring."
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,trixie,And how are we supposed to destroy the throne when we find it?
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,I... don't know.
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,trixie,[sarcastic] That's reassuring.
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,discord,I don't suppose you brought any throne-destroying tools along with these useless sideshow props.
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,trixie,Asks the Lord of Chaos who can't go for a walk without whining nonstop!
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,discord,"Yes, but when the throne is destroyed, I'll be able to rip the very fabric of reality to save our friends, while you'll still be a self-absorbed, below-average illusionist!"
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,trixie,"Self-absorbed?! Why, you...!"
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,"Cut. It. Out! I'm just barely keeping it together, and it would be wonderful if you two could actually try to help instead of bickering like foals!"
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,discord,[defeated] Okay.
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,trixie,How can we help?
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,"Don't ask me! I couldn't even handle giving advice at the Sunset Festival, and I had magic then! And the three of us are as good as useless! At least Thorax knows where we're going."
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,thorax,"Um, guys? I think we're lost."
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,trixie,"Oh, great. We might as well just sit here and wait for the changelings to soak up all of our love or whatever gross thing it is that they do. How often do you all get hungry?"
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,thorax,"Actually, I haven't been since I met Spike. And changelings are always hungry. We can never get enough love."
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,trixie,"Well, that's just super<U+0097>"
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,But you aren't hungry at all now?
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,thorax,"Huh. Once I made a few friends, I guess I just sort of forgot about the whole feeding thing."
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,Is that about the same time your wings changed?
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,thorax,I guess so.
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,trixie,[hushed] Can you please lower your voice?! You're gonna get us all captured!
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,discord,"Oh, you keep saying that, but I haven't seen an actual changeling since we got into this hive."
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,trixie,W-What's that?
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,thorax,A changeling patrol!
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,discord,This seems like one of those moments where we need a plan.
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,trixie,"What kind of plan?! We have no magic, and it's not like my illusions are gonna save us!"
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,Do you have any of your smoke bombs?
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,trixie,Are you kidding?
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,thorax,Looking for somepony?
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,discord,"Not exactly great and powerful, but effective."
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,trixie,Hm. I'll take it.
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,"""Klutzy""..."
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,discord,Ugh. I really think we need a new code word!
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,thorax,That was a pretty good plan.
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,trixie,But we still don't know where we're going.
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,"Actually, we might. Two of the changelings didn't go with the rest."
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,thorax,"Oh! With an intruder in the hive, they went to protect the queen! Good thinking, Starlight!"
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,trixie,Now what?
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,We... go in.
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,thorax,"Even if I wanted to, there's no way past the guards. We'll be spotted for sure."
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,We need some kind of... distraction.
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,trixie,I'm fresh out of smoke bombs.
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,discord,"Normally, I'm the most distracting thing I can think of, but without magic..."
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,You shouldn't underestimate yourself.
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,discord,"[taps microphone] Hello, changelings and changelettes! Believe me, I was just as surprised as you are that I'm here! When I heard that I'd be playing for a bunch of changelings, I was beside myself! Then I realized, it was just one of you."
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,discord,"[nervous laugh] But, seriously, this isn't the toughest crowd I've ever been in front of. But it's definitely the easiest to bug!"
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,discord,"Well, if you think that you can do any better, be my guest!"
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,trixie,It is absolutely ridiculous that that worked.
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,discord,It is certainly a pleasure to have such dedicated fans. I'll have to come back with some new material after I rescue Fluttershy.
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,discord,Fluttershy!
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,fluttershy,Discord! I'm stuck!
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,discord,You certainly are. And I should probably help you get free. But... oh-ho-ho-ho-ho...
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,fluttershy,But what?
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,discord,But you are obviously not Fluttershy!
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,fluttershy,Oh.
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,discord,"I mean, I'm separated from the group and just happen to come across the one pony I care most about? I can smell this setup a mile away."
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,fluttershy,"[sniffs, crying] No. You're right. There's no way you should trust me. Just go find the others. [wailing] I understand!"
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,discord,"Oh, come on!"
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,thorax,"We can't wait for Discord. Between seeing him and Trixie, the castle will be crawling with guards soon."
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,"But if we do manage to destroy Chrysalis' throne, we'll need him. He could take on the entire changeling army by sneezing if he wanted to."
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,trixie,He's probably already been captured!
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,thorax,We can't stay here. We gotta find the throne.
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,trixie,"""Klutzy""...?"
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,"[whispering] You know that's not Discord, right?"
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,trixie,Obviously.
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,thorax,"I know this trick. If he says to go left, we should definitely go right. He's leading us to a swarm waiting to attack!"
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,trixie,"[sighs] Okay, I'll handle it. You two just get ready to run into the other tunnel."
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,"Wait, what?! Trixie, you can't! I won't know what to do! We've already lost Discord; I can't lose you too! Without magic, I<U+0097>"
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,trixie,"Starlight. You got us this far with just my illusions and Discord's annoying personality. You don't need magic to figure out what to do next. I know you're afraid to be in charge, but you are really good at it! Listen to your best friend. Hey, Discord! Want to see the new trick I've been working on? I call it the ""Changeling Catcher""! Run!"
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,trixie,[nervously] Ta-da...
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,queen chrysalis,"[laughing evilly] One little pony all by herself. [joints cracking] Oh, how will I ever prevent this daring rescue?"
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,queen chrysalis,"Well, well, well. The Princess of Friendship's sole pupil. Honestly, I didn't think you were worth replacing with one of my drones."
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,thorax,[strains] You won't get away with this!
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,queen chrysalis,"I already have. Nopony is coming to save you. Your little squad was it. And now, there's just you."
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,thorax,Thorax is still out there.
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,queen chrysalis,"Don't mention that traitor's name in my kingdom! He was a fool to leave and even more a fool to return! When I find him, he'll learn just what happens to those who betray the hive!"
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,queen chrysalis,"And it seems I don't have far to look, do I..."
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,queen chrysalis,Thorax?
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,queen chrysalis,"Very clever. And clearly Thorax revealed to you the secret of my throne. I can't have powerful ponies using their abilities against me. Even with your rather embarrassing little rescue attempt, everything has gone according to my plan."
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,What plan? Why did you do all this?!
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,What if you didn't have to?
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,queen chrysalis,Ridiculous! The hunger of changelings can never be satisfied!
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,"Exactly! Thorax left the hive and made a friend. He shared love, and now he doesn't need to feed. You don't have to live your lives starving all the time!"
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,queen chrysalis,"You know nothing of the changelings or what it takes to be their queen! I decide what is best for my subjects, not some mewling grub!"
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,I know what it's like to lead by fear and intimidation! And I know what it's like to want everypony to do what you say! But I was wrong. A real leader doesn't force her subjects to deny who they are! She celebrates what makes them unique and listens when one of them finds a better way!
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,queen chrysalis,The only thing Thorax has found is what happens to those who turn their back on the hive!
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,No! Stop!
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,queen chrysalis,Just as soon as I drain every last ounce of love from him and show my subjects what a real leader is!
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,thorax,[straining] I can feel the love inside me slipping away...! I can't hold onto it much longer...!
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,Then don't! Sharing love is what made you different to begin with! You should share yours with Chrysalis! Give her all of it!
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,This is what happens when you give love freely instead of taking it!
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,discord,Fluttershy?
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,fluttershy,"It's, um, good to see you, too."
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,twilight sparkle,Starlight? What happened?
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,"We defeated the changelings with no magic at all, they found a new leader, and... they're all kinda... good now."
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,princess luna,"Well done, Starlight Glimmer. It seems as though you've learned a great deal since we last spoke."
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,"When Twilight and her friends defeated me, I chose to run away and seek revenge! You don't have to! You can be the leader your subjects deserve."
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,queen chrysalis,"There is no revenge you could ever conceive of that will come close to what I will exact upon you one day, Starlight Glimmer!"
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,princess celestia,"Thorax, as the new leader of the changelings, I look forward to discussing how we can improve our relationship in the future. However, for the moment, perhaps it is best that we leave the Changeling Kingdom to the changelings."
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,discord,Splendid idea! Now who's ready for some celebratory tea at Fluttershy's?!
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,fluttershy,"Oh! Uh, everypony?"
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,"Actually, now that you can snap your claws and send us absolutely anywhere again, I think I have a better option."
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,double diamond,"You left in such a hurry before, we kinda thought you didn't wanna come."
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,"Yeah... I guess after the way I used my magic on all of you, I wasn't sure I was somepony who should even be in charge of a baking contest. I was afraid I might go back to being the pony I used to be. But I realize that sometimes you don't have a choice. You have to step up. And I have changed! I can handle it. Whether that means saving Equestria or helping friends out with the Sunset Festival. Speaking of which, I know the Festival's almost over, but I kinda invited a few of my friends to join. Hope that's okay."
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,double diamond,[laughing] Are you kidding? Of course!
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,Great! Now where's that baking contest? This pony needs a cupcake!
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,discord,So I'm able to rip the very fabric of reality again.
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,trixie,"Yeah, yeah. And I'm still a self-absorbed, below-average illusionist, right?"
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,discord,"Actually, I was going to say a couple of those illusions were slightly above average. If you ever need a little chaos in your act, let me know."
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,trixie,Ha! When pigs fly!
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,trixie,Whoa! Whoooooaaaa!
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Josh Haber & Michael Vogel,rainbow dash,Somepony is really gonna have to catch us up on what we missed.
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,starlight glimmer,"Hey, Spike. What's up?"
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,spike,"Just, uh, wanted to make sure you're ready for your big ceremony today."
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,starlight glimmer,Yep!
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,starlight glimmer,"Wow, I still can't believe my friends and I are getting medals..."
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,Shhh!
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,starlight glimmer,...of honor.
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,spike,"Are you kidding? You totally deserve it! After all, you... saved Equestria from... Queen Chrysalis! With the help of Trixie and Thorax and Discord and..."
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,starlight glimmer,"Uh, yeah. I know what happened. I was kinda there."
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,spike,"Uh, right. Uh, so... what are you wearin'?"
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,starlight glimmer,Not sure. Why? Am I supposed to dress up?
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,starlight glimmer,What are you looking at?
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,spike,"No, don't look!"
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,spike,"'Cause there was a spider there, but it's, uh, gone now, so, uh... thanks, Starlight! Byeeee!"
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,starlight glimmer,Huh?
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,spike,"Ha-ha! She had no idea. We're a good team, Sparkle!"
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,"""Sparkle""? [laughs] Yeah, we are. So do you think she'll like it? I want this present to say, ""I'm so proud of you both as a mentor and a friend. Equestria is safer thanks to you."""
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,spike,Oh. I thought you were getting her a mirror like yours.
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,I am.
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,spike,"Uh, maybe you should get her a card 'cause I don't think the mirror will say all that. But I think she'll like it."
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,It's just what her room needs. The first thing she'll see when she wakes up is herself surrounded by all her friends. I plan on giving it to her after the ceremony.
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,spike,"Yeah, about that. Don't you need to get the castle ready for the celebration?"
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,Nah. Pinkie Pie's got that covered.
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,pinkie pie,Hmmm.
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,pinkie pie,Phew!
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,"Starlight, Trixie, Thorax, and Discord were brave in the face of danger, resourceful when things got challenging, and proved that the bonds of friendship, no matter how unlikely, are stronger than any adversity. By stopping Queen Chrysalis, not only did they save Equestria; they set the changelings free from her reign."
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,princess celestia,And that's why we're proud and honored to give them the Equestrian Pink Hearts of Courage!
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,pinkie pie,"Yeah! Oh. Uh, no. Not quite. Uh... all right. There it is!"
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,pinkie pie,Yay!
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,We are so proud of you all!
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,trixie,It was the Great and Powerful Trrrrixie's pleasure to save you from your imminent doom.
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,discord,"Yes, because you did it all by yourself."
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,sunburst,I can't believe you managed to do it without magic.
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,starlight glimmer,"Oh, I just did what anypony would have done."
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,princess celestia,"It's a wonderful feeling, isn't it? Watching your student shine the way you always knew they could."
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,[laughs] My cheeks are sore! I don't think I've ever smiled this much in my life!
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,princess celestia,I can only imagine what that feels like.
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,discord,"Yes, Starlight is student of the year, isn't she? She has so much potential. So, what are we going to do with her? And by ""we"", I definitely mean ""you"". Being her mentor and all that, her destiny falls squarely on your haunches."
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,"Oh, don't you worry. I've planned enough friendship lessons to cover the next three years."
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,What's so funny?
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,discord,"No, no. Clearly, Starlight is beyond basic friendship lessons. She just won a medal, for Equestria's sake. I thought you were joking. You are joking, right?"
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,[nervous laugh] Of course I was.
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,discord,"Obviously, you should have a grand master plan for her, the same way Celestia set you on the path that eventually made you a princess."
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,Yep.
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,discord,"Oh, good. I'm sure she can't wait to hear all about it."
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,starlight glimmer,So how's the whole ruling-a-kingdom thing going?
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,thorax,It's a bit overwhelming. But we're adjusting.
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,applejack,"Eh, not-not exactly."
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,discord,"Oh, Starlight. Princess Twilight has something very important to tell us. Well, just you, really, but I'm nosy and I want to hear."
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,starlight glimmer,Okay. Would you excuse m<U+0097>?
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,starlight glimmer,Never mind. What's going on?
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,discord,"Well, Twilight was just about to reveal her grand master plan for you."
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,starlight glimmer,Really? I was kind of wondering what we were gonna do next.
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,discord,Yes. I'd say we were both fairly interested.
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,trixie,"Starlight, come on! The Ponyville Chronicle wants to take our picture! Ugh. You, too, Discord."
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,discord,Psst! I see what you're doing.
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,You do?
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,discord,"You already planned the perfect moment during the party to make the grand announcement to everypony about your plan. Brava, Twilight! I can't wait to tell your plan to Fluttershy and the others!"
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,"Discord, no!"
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,spike,"Twilight, are you reading during a party... again?"
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,"No, no, no! She's already good at that! She mastered this! She taught me about this one!"
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,spike,Wild guess <U+0096> something's wrong.
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,spike,Whoa!
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,"I had years worth of friendship lessons ready to go, but when we were captured by Chrysalis, Starlight took charge and really stepped up. I don't think friendship lessons are enough for her anymore."
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,princess celestia,So you have an overachieving student. Sounds familiar.
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,"That's why I had to talk to you. You, of all ponies, would know what to do. I mean, you were me and I was Starlight. But, for now, I need you to pretend you're you and I'm me."
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,spike,Huh?
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,princess celestia,Heh. Go on.
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,"When I was your student, and you were in this place, you<U+0097> Oh, no! You sent me to Ponyville! Which means it's time for me to send Starlight Glimmer away!"
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,"I can't believe it! It's really time for Starlight to go, isn't it?"
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,princess celestia,"Only you can make that decision. It's a difficult one, but your heart knows what's right, even as it hurts."
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,spike,"Where're you gonna send her? Uh, too soon?"
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,"No. This is something I have to do. Oh, boy."
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,fluttershy,"Oh, boy!"
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,discord,Whatever Twilight's planning for Starlight is going to be so exciting!
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,applejack,Hmm. Wonder why she didn't tell any of us about it.
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,discord,"Probably because you're not as close as you think you are. [laughs] Just kidding. She wanted it to be a big surprise. Just between us, she's getting ready to make a big announcement!"
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,pinkie pie,"[squeals] That's so exciting! And surprising. Usually, you tell your party planner about all your plans for your party."
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,rainbow dash,"Well, she definitely has one. I mean when has Twilight not had a plan?"
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,"[low muttering] Gosh, I don't know... I just don't want to send her to the wrong place... [sighs] I just, I just don't know... [gasps] I got it! Since defeating Chrysalis, Starlight's given the changelings an opportunity to revolutionize their society. Maybe I can send her there."
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,spike,Cool spell.
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,"If Starlight goes to the changeling hive, she can help them adjust to their new way of life."
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,starlight glimmer,"Okay, Friendship 101. Thorax and I are going to show you how to compromise."
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,thorax,[stiltedly] I want to have honeysuckle nectar for lunch.
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,starlight glimmer,"[stiltedly] I would like a sandwich. Oh, no. What should we do?"
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,starlight glimmer,Or... Thorax and I can talk about it and come up with a solution that works for everypony.
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,thorax,"[stiltedly] Starlight, how do you feel about honeysuckle and peanut butter sandwiches?"
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,starlight glimmer,"[stiltedly] Why, that sounds dee-licious!"
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,spike,"Uh, this doesn't seem like something Starlight and Thorax would do."
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,princess celestia,"Uh, this is Twilight's fantasy, Spike. There is no wrong way to fantasize."
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,Thank you.
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,spike,Yep. Definitely a Twilight fantasy.
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,princess celestia,"This seems like a lovely path for Starlight. The changelings have so much to learn about how to enjoy love through friendships. Starlight would be busy for a very long time, but her work there would be very rewarding."
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,Or dangerous. It would only take one changeling to deviate from the pack.
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,spike,"Uh, that probably won't happen."
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,But it could! I can't just send her off to Celestia-knows-where without thinking it through!
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,princess celestia,"Hmm. I was not aware that I was an expression. An appropriate one, of course, for even I don't know the answer. This is a momentous decision. You must consider all the possibilities."
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,"Rethink, rethink, rethink! What about the dragons? I can send Starlight to the Dragon Lands! She and Ember would totally hit it off!"
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,starlight glimmer,Ember!
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,princess ember,Starlight!
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,princess ember,You ready to do some death-defying dragon stuff?
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,starlight glimmer,"Ah, totally!"
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,spike,"Okay, that doesn't sound anything like Ember or Starlight."
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,"Who knows what their dynamic would be, Spike?"
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,spike,Freaky.
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,"Starlight will love it in the Dragon Lands. In her letters, Ember said dragons do a lot of fun things. The Feast of Fire, the Dragon Bowl, Claw-chella."
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,"Starlight could be there for a really long time. But then again, not all dragons like ponies as much as Ember does."
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,garble,"Hey, Twinkle Star!"
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,starlight glimmer,"It's, uh, Starlight Glimmer."
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,garble,Star-kle Light-star?
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,starlight glimmer,Starlight. Glimmer.
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,garble,"Yeah, whatever. You wanna hang with us?"
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,starlight glimmer,What are we diving into?
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,garble,Lava!
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,starlight glimmer,What?!
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,spike,"Twilight, this is crazy!"
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,spike,Starlight's really good with magic. She could just stop herself from falling into a pit of lava.
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,"What if she didn't realize it was happening?! You just never know, Spike! I just need to think of someplace safe to send her! Someplace safe, someplace safe, someplace safe... I could send her to the Crystal Empire to continue her magical studies with Sunburst!"
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,It'll be perfect! Sunburst's knowledge of magic is only matched by Starlight's abilities.
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,sunburst,I've got it! Try placing your horn directly on the potion and picture the clock you wish to make.
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,They could challenge each other into becoming the most talented unicorns Equestria's ever seen!
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,starlight glimmer,"We did it! Quick, what's next?"
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,"Of course, the study of magic is a lifelong pursuit, and Starlight could be there for a while, especially once they start attempting the really complicated stuff!"
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,spike,"Three, two, one..."
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,What if they become too ambitious?!
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,starlight glimmer,I never would've thought to combine Star Swirl's apparition spell with Spacium Flexibus! But what would happen if we added Somnambula's Tempus Objectus?
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,sunburst,"If we do it just right, it should allow us to materialize an object that was lost in the past."
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,No! Don't do it!
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,spike,"Twilight, snap out of it!"
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,spike,"Easy, Twilight. It didn't happen."
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,But it could! I just don't think I can send her anywhere. What am I gonna do?
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,Are you laughing at me?
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,I can't believe you're laughing at me.
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,princess celestia,"Oh, Twilight, I'm not. I'm laughing because I had the exact same fears you're having."
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,What?!
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,princess celestia,"Let me tell you a story. Once upon a time, there was a very bright young filly."
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,princess celestia,[voiceover] She was truly one of my best students.
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,spike,[voiceover] Are you talking about Twilight? I can't see what you're thinking about.
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,princess celestia,"[voiceover] Yes, Spike. I was constantly surprised and impressed with her discoveries. But I noticed that her pursuit of academia was preventing her from reaching her full potential."
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,spike,[voiceover] You mean it was keeping her isolated and alone?
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,princess celestia,"[voiceover] Uh, yes, Spike. I had a decision to make. Oh, but it wasn't easy."
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,princess celestia,"Maybe I could close the library or throw a party in the castle. Oh, she'd have to talk to the other fillies then! Oh. I must send her away."
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,princess celestia,"[voiceover] I knew there was a special group of fillies in Ponyville, but I kept inventing all kinds of reasons why I shouldn't send you."
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,princess celestia,"What if she runs into a manticore? Or what if she gets pulled into Tartarus? Or, worst of all, what if she doesn't get along with anypony?!"
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,princess celestia,[voiceover] I kept you in Canterlot longer than I should have.
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,princess celestia,"Eventually, I realized all the anxiety I felt was because I didn't want you to go."
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,Really?
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,princess celestia,"I loved having you as a student. You challenged me and taught me just as much as I taught you. I am embarrassed to admit it, but I was afraid if you made friends, you wouldn't need me anymore."
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,"Princess Celestia, that is so not true. I will always need you."
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,princess celestia,I think Starlight Glimmer might feel the same way about you. If that is what you're afraid of.
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,Maybe it is. Just a little.
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,spike,"[chuckles] Oh, it definitely is. Like, a lot."
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,princess celestia,"Here we are after all these years, Twilight. We are living proof that letting someone spread their wings doesn't mean you no longer have a place in their lives."
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,Thank you.
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,princess celestia,"And if you're still worried, you can always make her write you letters."
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,discord,I may have let it slip that you'd be unveiling your big plan for Starlight tonight. Silly me. But we're all very excited to hear what you've cooked up.
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,discord,"You weren't coming up with a plan just now, were you? Oh, dear. This could be pretty embarrassing for you."
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,"[sarcastically] Gee, thanks, Discord."
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,discord,Anytime. I really do love being helpful.
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,"If I could have everypony's attention! As you all know, Starlight Glimmer's been my pupil for a while now, and I'd hoped she'd be my pupil for a long time yet to come. But it turns out that's just not meant to be."
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,"Starlight, you have proved yourself to be a kind, loyal, strong, honest, and truly magical friend. Just looking around this room at all the new friendships you've made, I know there's nothing more I need to teach you. So we have a second reason to celebrate today. Three cheers for Starlight Glimmer on her graduation day!"
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,pinkie pie,"[squeals, giggles] What a great surprise!"
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,[to Starlight] The future's in your own hooves now.
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,starlight glimmer,Wow. I was not expecting this!
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,discord,Darn it. I was hoping you would send her to my realm. We could've been roomies. Way to not pick up what I was putting down.
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,trixie,How do you want to celebrate? Girls' trip to Las Pegasus?
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,thorax,"We could throw you a changeling Gorbfest! Uh, it's more fun than it sounds."
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,discord,"Or we could go cause a little mischief. I know a trick that'll turn Celestia's castle into cheese. Do you think it's a ""gouda"" idea? [laughs] That's just the first of many cheese jokes if we go down this path."
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,starlight glimmer,"Well, that all sounds wonderful. But, um, give me a minute, would ya?"
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,Congratulations.
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,starlight glimmer,Thanks.
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,So how do you feel?
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,starlight glimmer,"Happy, surprised, overwhelmed. I mean, not that I'm not grateful, but are you sure?"
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,Believe me. I've thought long and hard about this.
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,starlight glimmer,Of course you did.
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,"Starlight, trust me. You're ready."
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,starlight glimmer,Yeah!
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,starlight glimmer,"No, I'm not."
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,What are you talking about?
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,starlight glimmer,I'm not ready to leave!
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,"Oh, good! 'Cause I'm not ready for that either! Here! I got you this present. It was going to be a ""congrats on getting a medal of honor"" present, but then I was afraid it would have to be a going-away present, but now it's an ""I couldn't be happier you're staying"" present! It fits perfectly over your dresser! I know. I measured."
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,starlight glimmer,Thank you.
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,"I may not know what comes next for you, but whatever it is, I promise I'll always be there for you."
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,starlight glimmer,Oh.
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,Oh.
Celestial Advice,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,pinkie pie,Phee-yew!
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,trixie,"Come on, come on! Turn into a teacup!"
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,trixie,No! Teacup!
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,trixie,No! Teacup!
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,trixie,"[screeching] No! [normally] Oh, Starlight! I can't put a trick that's not working into my act! How come it's not working?"
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,starlight glimmer,"It could be because you're just yelling ""teacup!"" and not picturing it in your mind."
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,trixie,"Oh. Yeah, that could be it."
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,starlight glimmer,What does your teacup look like? What shape is it? What color?
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,trixie,"Whoo! Starlight, I did it!"
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,trixie,"Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo! I did it, I did it, I did it! Woo-hoo-hoo!"
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,starlight glimmer,Hey!
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,trixie,"Teacup! [giggles] Teacup! Teacup, teacup, teacup! Tea-cup! Teacup, teacup, tea-cup! You know what you need? A teacup!"
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,trixie,Whoops! I guess I pictured a teacup poodle? Heh.
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,starlight glimmer,Trixie! You ruined my teacakes!
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,trixie,"I just got excited! This is the first time I did a transfiguration spell! Real magic! Come on! Be impressed by me! [as Starlight Glimmer] ""Yay, Trixie! You're so great at magic and having good hair!"""
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,starlight glimmer,"[chuckles] Good job, Trix. But I was baking these to give to Twilight and the girls for their friendship retreat. Pinkie Pie gave me a recipe and everything."
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,trixie,Problem solved.
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,starlight glimmer,[exhales] Not exactly.
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,I am so excited for this friendship retreat! I can't remember the last time we all got to hang out without having to save Equestria.
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,rainbow dash,"Well, we are awesome. But technically, we weren't the last ponies to save Equestria."
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,I was speaking in a broader sense. Are you sure you don't want to come with us?
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,spike,"Yeah, I have three new comics to get through."
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,starlight glimmer,"And I promised Trixie we'd practice more magic. It might be better if the castle was empty, if you know what I mean."
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,trixie,"[groans] Relax. If anything breaks, Starlight will just go back in time and fix it!"
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,trixie,Kidding.
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,starlight glimmer,We'll take good care of the castle while you're gone.
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,trixie,"Have fun on your friendship retreat! [hushed, to Starlight] What in Equestria is a friendship retreat, anyway?"
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,starlight glimmer,"[hushed] They're gonna bond, share laughs, and if I know them, they're gonna sing a song."
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,trixie,[giggles] We are gonna have so much more fun than them!
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,starlight glimmer,[giggles] Shhh!
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,trixie,"Twilight, wait! Starlight has something for you!"
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,Huh?
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,starlight glimmer,"[nervously] Here, I, um, brought you snacks..."
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,"Oh, how... thoughtful, thanks. We will... not get hungry on the train."
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,starlight glimmer,"It was supposed to be teacakes, but... [sighs] it's a long story. Have a great time!"
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,"You, too!"
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,starlight glimmer,"Okay, Trixie, what kinds of spells did you want to work on next?"
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,trixie,"Well, every self-respecting magician has a disappearing act, so maybe we could start with that?"
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,starlight glimmer,"Hmmm. Nothing just disappears, so that's technically a teleportation spell, and those are pretty hard. Maybe we should start with something smaller."
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,trixie,No-no-no-no. The Great and Powerful Trrrrrixie goes big or not at all! Just tell me how you do it.
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,starlight glimmer,"Well, I've always found magic is tied to my emotions. Whatever I'm feeling fuels whatever I'm doing, and the stronger I'm feeling, the stronger the magic."
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,trixie,"Right. Like when you were so upset that cutie marks took away your friend, your magic was strong enough to enslave an entire village."
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,starlight glimmer,Yep. Thanks for bringing that up.
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,trixie,See? I'm already learning. If anypony is gonna teach me how to do a disappearing spell<U+0097>
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,starlight glimmer,Teleportation spell.
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,trixie,"Whatever. I'm complimenting you. And me. We can do this, 'cause we're amazing, and magic is friendship and stuff."
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,starlight glimmer,"[laughs] I guess we can give it a whirl. Now, we just need to find you something to teleport."
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,trixie,Spike! How about it?
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,starlight glimmer,"Uh, let's pick something, I don't know, not living?"
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,trixie,"I mean it won't be as impressive, but okay. Teach away, mini-Twilight."
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,rarity,"Ooh, I'm going to start with a facial, and then get my hooves done, and<U+0097>"
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,"Oh, it's not that kind of retreat."
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,rarity,"Isn't it called ""Manehattan Escapes"" because it's a deluxe spa where you can escape all of your troubles?"
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,Nope! It's because we get locked in a room and we have to solve puzzles and riddles in order to escape!
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,Team-building!
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,applejack,"Come on, girls. This could be fun."
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,Could be? Some of the brightest minds in Equestria put together these puzzles!
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,fluttershy,I'm just happy to be with all of you.
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,pinkie pie,"Me, too! I'm not great at solving riddles, but I'm super great at cheering other ponies on while they do it! Go, us! Ooo, ooo! Woo-hoo!"
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,rarity,"Yes, yes, woo-hoo. [clears throat] But just so we know, exactly how long will we be locked in here?"
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,rainbow dash,"Hah! Griffons barely like each other! We're basically the poster ponies for amazing friendships! So get your quill ready, bub! You're gonna have to write down a new record!"
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,starlight glimmer,"If you master this spell before the girls get back, you'd be setting some kind of record!"
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,trixie,Challenge accepted!
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,starlight glimmer,Okay. What you want to do is concentrate on the object that you want to teleport...
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,spike,"Yeah, I'm gonna go... all the way over here."
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,trixie,Concentrate on teleporting. Got it. Doin' the spell!
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,starlight glimmer,"No, Trix, wait, not just<U+0097>"
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,trixie,[weakly] Ta-da.
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,starlight glimmer,[hyperventilating] No-no-no-no-no-no-no! You made Twilight's friendship map disappear!
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,trixie,[clears throat] Teleport.
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,starlight glimmer,Really?!
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,trixie,"Well, it was behind the apple. It was bound to happen. On the plus side, my magic is getting better! I made a whole table go poof! That was pretty impressive!"
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,starlight glimmer,"Trixie, we have to get that map back."
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,trixie,We'll find it. No big deal.
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,starlight glimmer,Twilight's never gonna trust me to be alone in this castle again! What were you thinking?!
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,trixie,"Teleport, like you told me to."
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,starlight glimmer,"No! You're supposed to concentrate on the object, not just teleporting!"
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,trixie,"[scoffs] Well, gee, you probably should have told me all the steps before you let me do the spell."
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,starlight glimmer,I tried. [gasps] I... need a minute.
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,spike,"Hey, are you okay?"
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,starlight glimmer,I will be once I cast a spell to contain my anger in this bottle.
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,spike,"Wait, what?"
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,starlight glimmer,"Do you see this storm cloud? This has never happened before! All this magical energy has to go somewhere, and if I'm not using it to fight a magical duel or bend my friends' wills to obey my every command..."
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,spike,Hah. I remember that.
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,starlight glimmer,"The point is, I don't know what my magic's going to do. So I'm hoping if I bottle up my anger, I won't do who-knows-what to Trixie."
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,spike,Are you sure that's a good idea?
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,starlight glimmer,"What choice do I have? I've got to get that map back, and I don't wanna lose Trixie. If she knew what I was thinking right now, she'd probably never talk to me again."
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,spike,Okay... You do what you need to do. I'll see if I can find the map somewhere in the castle.
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,starlight glimmer,Trixie!
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,trixie,"Oh, there you are! For a minute, I didn't think you were coming back, and that you might be upset with me for some weird reason. But then I remembered <U+0096> you never get mad at me."
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,starlight glimmer,"[exhales] Nope! [laughs nervously] Not mad at all! So, the map is probably in the last place you were thinking of. Where was that?"
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,trixie,"Ooh, great question. I wish you'd asked it, like, right after I did the spell. I don't remember anymore."
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,starlight glimmer,[groans] No worries. We'll just take a walk around town. Maybe that'll jog your memory.
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,trixie,"Okay, that sounds fun. Ooh!"
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,starlight glimmer,Did you remember?
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,trixie,Nope! But I did think we could stop for cinnamon nuts while we're out!
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,starlight glimmer,Cinnamon... nuts?
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,starlight glimmer,That's a good idea!
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,trixie,Yes! I've been craving something sweet since I couldn't have any teacakes this morning.
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,starlight glimmer,"[exhales] You got this, Starlight..."
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,pinkie pie,"Woo-hoo! Go, Twilight! you can do it!"
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,pinkie pie,Woo-hoo!
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,applejack,"Hoo-wee! You solved that triangley thing mighty fast! Uh, does anypony need a purple jewel?"
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,rarity,Ooh! Plum or boysenberry?
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,applejack,Don't both those fruits mean purple?
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,rarity,"Yes, but one's a lovely purple and one's... well, icky."
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,rainbow dash,[groans] Just put the gem in! We're trying to set a record here!
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,pinkie pie,"[cheer-singing] Yay! We solved another clue, 'cause our friendship is so true! Yaaaay, us! Woo-hoo!"
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,trixie,"Mmm, yes. I got them from the cart outside. They're delicious. Do you want some?"
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,starlight glimmer,"Have you seen a big table? Magical map on it, sometimes glowing cutie marks shoot out?"
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,trixie,"Well, I cast a pretty amazing spell that transported it to the last place I was thinking of, but I might have been thinking about how I'd treat myself to a nice brooch instead."
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,trixie,Sure!
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,starlight glimmer,No! We don't have time for this! Twilight and the girls are gonna be back soon!
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,starlight glimmer,But I'm not upset. What's our next stop?
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,granny smith,"Nope, I ain't seen it."
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,starlight glimmer,"Are you sure? It's really, really important that we find it. And it might be here because somepony..."
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,starlight glimmer,...was craving apples.
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,trixie,I'm still craving them. They'd go so well with cinnamon nuts!
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,granny smith,"[sniffs] Oh, them nuts sure do smell good! Heh-heh."
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,starlight glimmer,"Granny Smith, please. The table?"
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,granny smith,"[confused muttering] Well, my eyes ain't what they used to be, but I'd know for sure if a big ol' table done appeared out of thin air."
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,trixie,"Darn. I could've sworn it'd be at the ice cream parlor, because it was warm in the castle and I thought I wanted ice cream, and<U+0097> Ooh! Maybe we should check out the Crystal Empire, 'cause Twilight's castle is made out of crystals, so I totally had crystals on my mind."
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,starlight glimmer,"[tired] Okay, we better start moving if we want to make it to the Crystal Empire."
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,trixie,"Are you okay, Starlight? Because you seem a little, uh, what's the word... ""lch-bh-ba""."
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,starlight glimmer,[tired] Nope. I am great.
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,trixie,Did your saddlebag just glow?
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,starlight glimmer,[weakly] No.
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,trixie,Gimme!
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,starlight glimmer,[weakly] No!
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,trixie,Give it here!
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,starlight glimmer,[weakly] Don't!
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,trixie,What's in this?
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,bulk biceps,Cinnamon nuts!
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,granny smith,"Ooh, I have had a hankerin' for these all day!"
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,trixie,"Um, why are they looking at me like that...?"
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,trixie,Whoa!
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,granny smith,You ruined my teacakes!
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,trixie,Were they your pretzels? I don't understand.
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,bulk biceps,You don't pay attention when I'm trying to teach you!
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,trixie,"Starlight, can you help me, please?!"
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,applejack,"Uh, Twilight, can you help me, please?"
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,rainbow dash,I've seen those symbols! Over here!
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,pinkie pie,You can do it!
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,rarity,Almost there.
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,fluttershy,I've got the key!
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,This is it! I'm so impressed.
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,rainbow dash,I'm not. I knew we were the best!
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,granny smith,You're the worst!
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,trixie,That seems harsh.
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,granny smith,Hiyaaa!
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,trixie,"Whoa! Starlight! [panting] I don't know what's happening! Starlight, help!"
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,starlight glimmer,I'm glad Twilight isn't here to see this.
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,I wish that Starlight was here to see how strong friendships can be when we trust each other and work together! You've all taught me so much.
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,"Friendship used to make me so queasy, queasy But you made it all so easy, easy Now I don't have to say what I'm thinking You already know without even blinking"
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,applejack,You girls are the apple of my eye
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,rainbow dash,The race that doesn't end in a tie
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,pinkie pie,You are the funnel cake at my fair
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,fluttershy,The warm hug of a fuzzy bear
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,trixie,Starlight! A spark of magic could be very helpful right about now!
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,starlight glimmer,[grunting] I can't...!
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,"I simply can't imagine there'd be a day Where I wouldn't want to be walking your way Whatever new problems there may be, may be Our friendship is always the door with the key"
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,rarity,You are the jewels in my friendship crown
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,The sparks that make my world go 'round
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,rainbow dash,Gah!
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,rainbow dash,[panting] Did we do it?
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,rainbow dash,"Aw, nuts!"
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,trixie,Nuts!
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,bulk biceps,You just do whatever you want to do!
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,trixie,Starlight!
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,granny smith,And you don't always... [pants] ...have to bring up my dark past!
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,trixie,"I didn't know you had one, Granny Smith!"
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,trixie,I barely even know you! I don't understand why you're all so mad at me!
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,starlight glimmer,[weakly] They're not. I am.
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,trixie,You are?
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,starlight glimmer,"[sighs] I'm really... mad at you. You lost Twilight's map table. You make jokes like it's no big deal. It's like you don't even care you could get me in a lot of trouble. If we can't find that table, Twilight's never going to trust me again, and the worst part is you didn't even say you were sorry!"
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,trixie,I... I-I'm sorry. I had no idea you felt that way.
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,starlight glimmer,"Yeah! I do! [sighs] But to be fair, I don't know how you could have known. I did a spell and bottled up my anger, but when the bottle broke, it infected these three. I'm really sorry. I used magic so I wouldn't use magic. I should have guessed that would backfire."
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,granny smith,"Yeah, I was gonna get my dentures cleaned before y'all showed up."
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,bulk biceps,"Ah! Oh, no! My nut cart!"
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,bulk biceps,Yay! My nut cart!
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,bulk biceps,[gasps] I'm late for my other job! What? I wear many hats.
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,trixie,Not gonna lie. Hearing you and those random ponies say all those terrible things about me wasn't easy. But I needed to hear it. Why didn't you just tell me how you felt?
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,starlight glimmer,I didn't want to lose you as a friend.
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,trixie,Pfft! Come on! It'd take a lot more than that to lose me. Our friendship is stronger than a few angry words.
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,starlight glimmer,And a magical temper tantrum?
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,trixie,"Listen, I'd take that over the boring pony you were becoming any day. The Starlight I love is passionate, lively, and yeah, sometimes angry. Those are my favorite parts of you. That and the fact that you forgive me every time."
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,starlight glimmer,[giggles] I'll forgive you if you forgive me.
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,trixie,Deal. [gasps] I remembered what I was thinking about!
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,starlight glimmer,You're kidding me.
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,trixie,"There's more to it than that. I was thinking about how glad I am to have met you, and I remembered our first meeting <U+0096> here at the Ponyville spa. And now I just have to teleport it back!"
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,starlight glimmer,No-no-no-no-no-no-no!
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,spike,"A little to the left. Oh, now rotate it just a hair..."
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,"Hey, girls! How'd it go?"
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,...What?
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,starlight glimmer,Let's just say I learned a friendship lesson while you were gone.
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,"You've barely graduated, and you're already taking initiative! [tearing up] Oh... So proud..."
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,fluttershy,We learned about team building and problem solving...
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,pinkie pie,And when not to sing songs!
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,rarity,"We certainly had a good time, but I really was looking forward to a spa day, and the Ponyville spa's still open. Anyone?"
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,Sounds good to me!
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,rainbow dash,[simultaneously] I have a coupon!
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,trixie,We'll meet you there! [to Starlight] Quick! Do you have a spell that will make the spa ponies forget that the map table was there?
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,starlight glimmer,Haven't you learned anything about using magic to solve your problems?
All Bottled Up,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,trixie,"No. If we learned that lesson, how will we ever have fun?"
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,twilight sparkle,I'm never too busy to visit sick foals. I can't believe a whole class just came down with the horsey hives!
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,twilight sparkle,"We'll do our best. We'll bring snacks, I'll read to them, and get them gifts!"
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,spike,Food and presents always cheer me up.
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,twilight sparkle,We'll see you soon!
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,spike,"Okay, if we want to be at the hospital by lunch, then we have three hours to buy get-well presents, borrow a book from the schoolhouse, [sighing] and pick up treats."
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,twilight sparkle,"It's a lot, but if we stick to the schedule, I know we can get it all done."
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,spike,"Yeah, knock on wood."
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,shining armor,Surprise!
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,twilight sparkle,"[gasps] Oh, my gosh! How's my favorite niece?"
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,shining armor,"[as Flurry Heart] ""I'm good! I was hoping my favowite aunt could watch me for a few houwrs."""
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,princess cadance,Hope you're not too busy.
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,twilight sparkle,Busy? [scoffs] Would the best aunt ever be too busy to spend time with this adorable little one?
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,twilight sparkle,No!
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,twilight sparkle,[blows raspberry] Flurry! I've got a surprise for you!
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,twilight sparkle,Just a couple of toys that reminded me of Flurry.
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,twilight sparkle,I'm excited to show you I've done some shopping for Flurry Heart.
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,princess cadance,"Oh-ho-ho, you're so sweet. You didn't have to do all that."
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,twilight sparkle,"I know, but I can't help myself! Best aunt ever! Open this one, Flurry."
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,shining armor,"We'll just put Flurry's things over here, Twily!"
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,twilight sparkle,Uh-huh. Totally.
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,shining armor,"Mashed peas, her favorite."
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,princess cadance,"And diapers. Uh, extra diapers. Oh, and backup extra diapers. Heh."
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,shining armor,"Mashed peas, her favorite. Wait, did I say that already?"
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,spike,Uh-huh.
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,shining armor,Oops.
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,princess cadance,"Oh, and this is the most important thing of all <U+0096> her Whammy."
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,spike,I take it Flurry named it?
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,princess cadance,"Yup. If she gets fussy, just give her the Whammy and she'll calm right down."
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,shining armor,"You getting all this, Twily?"
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,twilight sparkle,"Whammy. Got it. Where are you guys headed, anyway?"
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,shining armor,"You remember my friend from the royal guard, Spearhead?"
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,spike,"Honestly, all of your friends' names are very similar."
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,shining armor,"Well, he has a pop-up art show at the Ponyville Cafe, and we decided to go at the last minute."
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,princess cadance,"We're not exactly art enthusiasts, but we could really use a night out."
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,spike,"You mean ""day""?"
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,princess cadance,That's what I said! Isn't that what I said?
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,spike,Mmm... Mm-mm.
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,princess cadance,"Either way, are you sure you can watch her?"
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,spike,Uh-uh-uh!
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,twilight sparkle,Mmmmh...
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,twilight sparkle,Have no fear! The best aunt ever has everything under control!
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,shining armor,"Thanks again, Twily."
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,spike,"Okay, let's grab that Whummy thing and go."
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,twilight sparkle,"Oh, you want to pretend we're the bears. I suppose we have time for a quick game."
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,spike,"Do we, though?"
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,twilight sparkle,Hey! All right! [growls like a bear] I'm gonna get ya!
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,spike,"Ugh! [sighs] You should catch her soon, 'cause we've got lots to do! Horsey-hives-covered foals counting on us, remember?"
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,twilight sparkle,Got it! [growls like a bear] I'm catching up!
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,twilight sparkle,"Uh-oh. Sorry, bug. Did that scare you? It's okay. It's just Auntie Twily!"
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,twilight sparkle,"You know, that was a very advanced spell for somepony your age. Looks like you're already taking after your Auntie Twily."
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,spike,"All right, that was pretty adorable. But now..."
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,twilight sparkle,"I know, Spike, we're leaving."
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,twilight sparkle,I just have to feed her real quick.
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,shining armor,Is this art or... a mistake?
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,princess cadance,I have no idea. But who cares? We're not changing diapers.
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,shining armor,Of course! We're having a great time! Loving all the... art!
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,shining armor,So it is! I knew that!
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,princess cadance,"Wow, I guess nighttime in a hallway can be pretty dark."
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,shining armor,[baffled] Yeah. Totally.
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,princess cadance,We're just so happy to be here. Usually we're covered in mashed peas by now.
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,spike,When they said mashed peas were her favorite...
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,spike,...did they mean her favorite thing to decorate a room with?!
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,twilight sparkle,"Aw, come on, Spike. That wasn't too bad."
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,spike,"Yeah, and we're only twenty minutes behind schedule."
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,twilight sparkle,Twenty minutes?! [exhales] It's fine. We can totally do this.
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,twilight sparkle,"Okay, we just need to grab some toys and we are outta here."
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,twilight sparkle,"You want to play, don't you? Well, I know a game that's even more fun! [aside to Spike] And more efficient. [to Flurry Heart] Playing race carts! Ha-ha!"
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,twilight sparkle,Woo-hoo!
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,spike,"[panting] [out of breath] Hey, nice thinking, Twilight!"
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,twilight sparkle,"Best aunt ever! Hang on, Flurry. The race cart's taking a pit stop."
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,spike,"I'm not a detective, but I think we got a suspect."
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,twilight sparkle,"Huh?! [sighs] Well, we'd better get to cleaning. We've got no time to waste!"
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,twilight sparkle,[panting] Yes! We gained back a whole five minutes from running here!
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,spike,"Yeah, but if you add that to the forty minutes we were already behind... we're still... fifty five minutes behind!"
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,spike,"I mean... [nervous chuckle] Yay, team?"
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,twilight sparkle,Mm-hmm!
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,twilight sparkle,"Thanks for helping us out, Cheerilee. Sorry we were late."
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,cheerilee,"Oh, no problem. But I gotta say, I'm surprised you came to me for a book. Don't you have a huge collection?"
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,twilight sparkle,"Yes, but<U+0097>"
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,twilight sparkle,"Sorry, one second."
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,twilight sparkle,I didn't think the foals would be interested in The Unabridged History of Amulets in pony Latin.
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,cheerilee,"Yeah, it was good you came to me. How about the complete collection of Ponyville Fables and Stables?"
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,twilight sparkle,"Mmm, too long."
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,cheerilee,Alien Alicorns vs. Space Pirates?
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,twilight sparkle,"Well, the science there is preposterous<U+0097>"
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,spike,"How about Burnferno, Warrior from Within? It's about a handsome dragon warrior who slays evildoers with his breath and his snappy comebacks!"
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,twilight sparkle,[giggles] Let's borrow that for you and keep looking.
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,spike,Eh.
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,twilight sparkle,What else?
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,cheerilee,"Uh, how about Gusty the Great?"
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,twilight sparkle,"Ooh, that was one of my favorites when I was a filly! We'll take it!"
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,twilight sparkle,"Cheerilee, I am so, so sorry! I didn't even hear her leave!"
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,twilight sparkle,"There, all clean."
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,cheerilee,Great. Now I'll just write it up again...! [slightly muffled] With my mouth.
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,twilight sparkle,Ehh...
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,princess cadance,[unsure] Oh...
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,shining armor,"This reminds me of the time Flurry got into the chocolate pudding, and we found little chocolate hoofprints all over the carpet."
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,princess cadance,That took forever to clean up! But remember how cute her little face looked when we caught her?
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,shining armor,"Yeah. She was like, [imitating Flurry Heart] ""Uh-oh!"""
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,spike,"Honestly, Twilight, I don't even want to tell you how late we are. Should I just cancel our visit to the hospital?"
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,twilight sparkle,"What?! Cancel?! We can't cancel, Spike! The sick foals are counting on us! And the B.A.E. would never throw in the towel like that!"
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,spike,B.A.E.?
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,twilight sparkle,"""Best Aunt Ever""? Besides, this errand is gonna be different."
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,spike,How do you figure that?
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,twilight sparkle,Because Flurry can play with the Cake twins and stay out of trouble! Best aunt ever!
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,twilight sparkle,Wonderful! They're friends already!
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,spike,Huh. I shouldn't have doubted you.
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,twilight sparkle,"Thanks! Wait, you doubted me?"
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,twilight sparkle,"Spike, you watch Flurry. I'll take care of everything else. [quickly, to Pinkie Pie] Hi, Pinkie! How's it going? I need to pick up the cupcakes for the foals at the hospital! And can you do apology treats?"
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,pinkie pie,I'm good. Here they are. Of course I can!
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,twilight sparkle,Do you still have a giant file on everypony's favorite treat?
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,pinkie pie,In my secret party planning cave!
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,pinkie pie,BRB!
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,twilight sparkle,Hee-hee! Remind me to tell you later how amazing you are. Cheerilee?
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,pinkie pie,Eh. I am pretty awesome.
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,pinkie pie,Cherry oatmeal cookies with yellow sprinkles.
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,twilight sparkle,"Great! Can you write ""sorry"" on them?"
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,pinkie pie,I've got a stamp for that!
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,spike,"Hey, you guys! No need to fight! Uh... Hang on! I'm sure there's another one! Ugh, no, not this one... Oh, that's cute..."
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,twilight sparkle,"Hold on, sweetie. We'll play in a second."
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,twilight sparkle,The salespony at the toy store...
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,pinkie pie,Apple strudel cupcake with caramel drizzle!
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,twilight sparkle,"Oh, no. You're making the same face Cheerilee made. Pinkie, remind me what your favorite treat is."
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,pinkie pie,Mmm... The sampler platter.
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,twilight sparkle,We'll take three of those.
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,spike,Uh... Twilight?
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,twilight sparkle,Out of the question! We are not cancelling! It's going to be okay! It has to be okay! It's been so terrible so far it can't possibly end up<U+0097> Oh...
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,spike,"Uh, sorry."
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,twilight sparkle,"[sighs] No, I needed it."
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,spike,"I was just gonna say, we're here."
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,spike,And we're only four-and-a-half minutes late!
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,twilight sparkle,Four and a half?!
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,twilight sparkle,"[reading] ""...and while nopony had ever tried to reach Cloudsdale on hoof, Gusty the Great was not deterred! She and her unicorn warriors marched up the hill. But suddenly, they encountered..."""
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,spike,[gasps] What?! What was it?!
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,twilight sparkle,"""It was the treacherous Grogar..."""
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,twilight sparkle,"""...and Gusty could tell he was ready for battle. Gusty called out to the unicorn warriors<U+0097>"" Ow! Not right now, Flurry. These foals really want to hear this."
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,twilight sparkle,"[reading] ""'We can fight Grogar together!' And the unicorn warriors shot magical beams into the clouds that wove into one! The beam, stronger than a thousand armies, shined down!"""
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,twilight sparkle,"[reading] ""It wrapped around Grogar and pulled him to the ground! 'Don't let him escape!', yelled Gusty!"""
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,twilight sparkle,"[reading] ""Grogar was strong, for fear gave him power, and he broke through the bonds!"""
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,twilight sparkle,"I know! So good, right?"
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,spike,"Twilight, look up!"
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,twilight sparkle,"Spike, you're floating. You're floating!"
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,spike,So are you!
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,twilight sparkle,"Flurry, honey, you need to stop this. Put us down, please."
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,spike,"Twilight, look out!"
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,twilight sparkle,Nopony panic! Everything's gonna be okay!
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,twilight sparkle,"Oh, I can't keep up with her!"
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,spike,"Oh, yeah, where's her Snoozle?!"
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,twilight sparkle,Her what?!
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,spike,"You know, her Whacky Whompy thing? The snail? Where is it? Cadance said it calms her down."
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,twilight sparkle,I don't see it!
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,twilight sparkle,Flurry Heart! Put us all down this instant!
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,twilight sparkle,Is everypony okay?
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,twilight sparkle,"Flurry, that was very, very bad! You could have hurt somepony!"
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,twilight sparkle,"Oh, Flurry, I didn't mean to<U+0097>"
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,twilight sparkle,"Sweetie, you don't have to be scared. It's just me, see?"
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,twilight sparkle,"You're scared of me. Because I yelled at you like a big scary bear. Flurry, I'm so sorry. I've been a terrible aunt today. All you wanted to do was play, and I've barely been able to pay attention to you. None of this is your fault. It's mine. So much for being the best aunt ever. But I hope you know how much I love you."
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,twilight sparkle,"Oh, I take it you forgive me?"
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,twilight sparkle,"Thanks, Flurry. How about we head home? After we find your Whammy, of course."
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,princess cadance,[tearing up] This one kind of reminds me of Flurry's hair.
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,shining armor,[tearing up] Uh-huh. And this one reminds me of Flurry too.
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,shining armor,"It's small... like her! I-I can't do this anymore! Spearhead, this has been great, but<U+0097>"
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,shining armor,What...?
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,shining armor,"Flurry?! Where's our little foal?! Ah! Oh, we missed you so much!"
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,princess cadance,But it looks like you had a great time without us.
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,twilight sparkle,"Actually, not so much. Flurry got into some mischief, but it wasn't her fault. I shouldn't have agreed to watch her with such a jam-packed schedule. It was too much to juggle. But Flurry taught me an important lesson today. It turns out being the best aunt ever isn't about spending the most time with your niece, but spending quality time with her. And she taught me a really cool bear game, so I guess I learned two things."
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,shining armor,"Well, we definitely should've given you more of a heads up."
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,princess cadance,"Yes! From now on, we'll give you plenty of notice."
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,twilight sparkle,"Ohh, that would be great."
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,princess cadance,"Hey, what are you doing next Tuesday?"
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,princess cadance,"For dinner, not to babysit."
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,twilight sparkle,"[chuckle] I'll have to check with Spike, but I think we're free."
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,princess cadance,"Where is Spike, anyway?"
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,spike,"[reading] ""The dashing dragon warrior breathed a scorching flame from his snout, then chuckled to himself as he flew into the sunset. 'If you can't stand the heat, don't fight a dragon!'"""
A Flurry of Emotions,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,spike,"Thank you! Okay, now who wants more cake?"
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,"Go, Maud! Woo-hoo! Number one! Number one!"
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,"Whoo! Doctor Pie! Doctor Pie! ...""Rock-tor"" Pie?"
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,maud pie,[deadpan] I'm Maud.
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,"Yeah, you are! Brilliant speech! Encore! Encore!"
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,maud pie,"[deadpan] There's more, Pinkie. I'm Maud. [flips index card] Pie. Thank you."
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,You are so welcome! Brilliant speech! Encore! Encore! Encore!
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,"[long high-pitched squeal, rapidly] You're moving to Ponyville! We'll live together and get bunk beds and I'll make us fuzzy slippers that say ""Best Sister Friends Forever"", although I probably can't fit all those words on a slipper, so maybe just ""BSFF"", but we don't have to decide right now because we'll be together all the time since when it comes to Ponyville, the doctor is in!"
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,maud pie,"[deadpan] Slow down, Pinkie Pie."
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,Yooooouuuuu'rrrrrrrreeeeeeee mmmmmmmmmmooooooooovvvvvvvviiiiiiiinnnnnnnnnggggggg tttttttooooooo Pooooooooooonnnnnnnnyyyyyyyyvvvvvvviiiiiiilllllllleeeeeeeee....
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,maud pie,[deadpan] I'm not definitely moving to Ponyville.
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,maud pie,[deadpan] I'm also considering Ghastly Gorge.
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,[laughs] Classic Maud sense of humor! You should do stand-up!
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,maud pie,[deadpan] I do. But that wasn't a joke.
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,"[gasps] Ghastly Gorge? That terrible, awful, no-fun, all-alone canyon in the middle of nowhere?"
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,maud pie,[deadpan] There or Ponyville.
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,"But Ponyville is so ""eee-hee-hee-hee-hee!"" and Ghastly Gorge is so ""Blegh!"""
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,maud pie,[deadpan] It's a rock-based decision.
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,But what about BSFFs?
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,maud pie,[deadpan] That's why I'm giving Ponyville a chance.
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,"Phew! So all I have to do is prove Ponyville has better rocks than Ghastly Gorge? Challenge accepted. We'll drop your stuff off at my place, and then hold onto your world, 'cause it's about... to... get... rocked!"
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,maud pie,[deadpan] Okay.
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,"Ghastly Gorge may have rocks, but our gem cave rocks!"
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,"Huh? Huh? Oh, and look! You'll never know who you'll see!"
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,rarity,"[gasps] Maud, darling! It's lovely to see you again! Oh! Congratulations on your rocktorate. What are you doing now?"
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,maud pie,[deadpan] Talking to you.
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,rarity,"Oh, y<U+0097> Right. [laughs, clears throat] Well, if your trained eye happens to see a chartreuse gem, I'm desperate to find one."
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,maud pie,[deadpan] I found one.
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,rarity,"Oh, you're an absolute darling! This will surely make my gown stand out at Countess Coloratura's album release party. Do you know how rare this is?"
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,Just another day in Ponyville!
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,maud pie,[deadpan] That's actually a really common gem.
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,maud pie,[deadpan] These are all really common gems.
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,"They are? Uh, I mean, heh, come on! Of course they are! That's why I didn't bring you here to impress you! I wanted to make sure you had a chance to, heh, say ""hello"" to your old pal... Spike!"
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,maud pie,"[deadpan] Hello, Spike."
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,"Way to go, Maud! Cross that off the to-do list! Y'know what I'm sayin'? Check! Now, let's get moving, 'cause I'm about to show you something that'll make you yell ""All right!"""
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,maud pie,[deadpan] All right.
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,See? Ha-ha!
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,Ta-da! It's a castle... made of rocks! Whaaaat?! Did I just blow your mind? I think I just blew your mind.
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,maud pie,"[deadpan] A lot of structures are made from rocks, Pinkie. They're a very stable building material."
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,"But this place grew out of nowhere after a magical key-build gem followed a rainbow and buried itself in the ground! I mean, have you ever seen rocks like this?"
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,maud pie,[deadpan] Yes.
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,"No, you haven't!"
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,maud pie,[deadpan] We literally just saw hundreds of them in the gem cave.
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,"But... but... Oh, look at those rocks!"
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,maud pie,[deadpan] Those are sting-bush seed pods.
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,"So they are! But, uh... look at that rock! It's even got four smaller rocks around it like legs!"
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,maud pie,[deadpan] That's a tortoise.
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,[sighs] I guess you won't be moving to Ponyville after all. Those rocks at Ghastly Gorge don't know how lucky they are to have you.
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,maud pie,"[deadpan] Actually, rocks aren't the only reason I'm considering Ponyville."
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,You said it's a rock-based decision.
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,maud pie,"[deadpan] I'm obviously passionate about exotic rocks, but I've always studied them... alone. I could handle some less exciting rocks if it meant I'd have somepony to talk to besides Boulder."
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,[gasps] Are you saying you want... a friend?!
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,maud pie,[deadpan] I wouldn't mind one.
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,maud pie,[deadpan] It isn't hard to meet somepony I like. It's finding somepony who gets me.
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,I get you.
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,maud pie,[deadpan] You're my sister. It's different.
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,"Maud, you are the best! You never know when the lightning of friendship will strike. Somepony could come barreling through that door at this very moment and become your best friend!"
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,"Y'know, I really thought somepony was gonna come barreling through that<U+0097>"
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,maud pie,[deadpan] Uh.
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,starlight glimmer,"Oh, my fault! Totally my fault! Are you okay? I should've been watching where I was going, and<U+0097> You look really familiar. Have we met before?"
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,maud pie,[deadpan] Yes.
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,starlight glimmer,I knew it!
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,Whaaaaat?!
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,starlight glimmer,"No, no, don't tell me. Um..."
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,starlight glimmer,"Yeah. See, I was really hoping you'd tell me while I pretended to remember."
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,maud pie,[deadpan] I traveled Equestria for my rocktorate dissertation.
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,starlight glimmer,Psst! Do you know a lot about rocks?
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,maud pie,[deadpan] Yes.
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,starlight glimmer,Have you ever come across some kind of super-powerful stone that can store the cutie mark magic of... I don't know... an entire village?
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,maud pie,[deadpan] Yep. In the big cave.
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,"[laughs] Hey, I got an idea. Let's not tell anypony that part where you maybe, for sure, accidentally helped Starlight enslave a town! [laughs, seriously] Tell nopony!"
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,maud pie,[deadpan] It's not like she's enslaved anypony lately.
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,[through the side of her mouth] Offer to help.
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,maud pie,[deadpan] What?
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,Offer to help!
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,starlight glimmer,You wanna help?
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,maud pie,[deadpan] Do I?
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,Of course you do! Go!
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,maud pie,[deadpan] Okay.
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,"[squeals] They're totally gonna be best friends and then Maud will choose Ponyville, and we'll get to wear BSFF slippers!"
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,maud pie,"[deadpan] Rocks take on different properties when interacting with magic. With the right stone, you could rule all of Equestria if you wanted to."
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,starlight glimmer,You're messing with me.
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,maud pie,[deadpan] Am I?
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,starlight glimmer,"[laughs, sighs] So other than rocks, what else are you into?"
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,maud pie,"[deadpan] Minerals. Plate tectonics. Oh, and stand-up comedy, of course."
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,starlight glimmer,I like... kites.
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,maud pie,[deadpan] Kites are cool.
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,starlight glimmer,"The trick with an S.L.K. is not to make the spars too heavy. But if they're too light, you've got no ballast and then good luck tacking against the A.O.I.! [beat] I really like kites."
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,maud pie,[deadpan] They're starting to grow on me.
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,"Pizza delivery! Oh! Maud and Starlight? You're here too? Whoa-ho-ho! What a coincidence! 'Cause I was just, y'know, delivering this pizza to, um... you!"
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,So how's it going?
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,starlight glimmer,"Uh, just hanging out<U+0097>"
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,"Hey! You could use this time to bond and talk about feelings! For example, do you feel like you're becoming friends?"
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,starlight glimmer,Um... I feel... like I don't want to talk about feelings?
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,"Great! I'll go next. I feel like I love that you two are becoming best friends! I mean, your friendship could be the friendship that makes Maud move to Ponyville! No pressure, Starlight. Um, hello? Where'd you two go?"
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,maud pie,[deadpan] Sorry about my sister. There's no half-excited with her.
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,starlight glimmer,"Oh, I know. But she always calms down. Eventually."
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,starlight glimmer,Why do you find rocks so fascinating?
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,maud pie,[deadpan] Each one has a different story to tell. Like Boulder here. This tells me he's over two thousand years old. [to Boulder] You don't look a day over six hundred.
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,starlight glimmer,Wow. You can tell that from a line?
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,maud pie,[deadpan] I didn't get a rocktorate because I can shred on guitar like nopony else.
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,maud pie,[deadpan] Another reason I like rocks <U+0096> they don't exclude you if you're... different than other ponies.
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,starlight glimmer,"They're beautiful and strong, but they don't judge you or make you feel less than in any way. I think I'm starting to like rocks, too."
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,starlight glimmer,It's hollow?
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,maud pie,[deadpan] It's granite. Hollow granite is highly unusual.
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,starlight glimmer,Wow! Have you ever seen anything like this?
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,maud pie,[deadpan] No. And that's unusual. For me.
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,There you are! I thought you went your separate ways but you can't imagine how happy I am to find you both together and to witness one of your firsts as friends!
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,"First time discovering an underground cavern! [squeals] I can't wait 'til you're old and eating pistachios together and telling your grand-foals about this! Oh, no! They're not bonding!"
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,I got an idea!
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,[exaggerated] Whooaa! I'm tripping on a rock at this very moment! And now I'm falling down!
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,"[exaggerated] Oh, no! My accidental clumsiness has trapped us here! Where you'll be forced to bond until we're rescued."
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,starlight glimmer,"Oh, we won't have to wait for that. There's gotta be a spell that<U+0097>"
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,maud pie,"[deadpan, to Boulder] Get us out of here, boy."
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,starlight glimmer,"Boulder, that was awesome!"
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,maud pie,[deadpan] No. That was sandstone.
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,starlight glimmer,"More sand than stone, apparently."
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,"I'm thinking you wear these around your neck at all times so I don't lose you again, you sillies! That way, I can track your progress as friends!"
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,"Ooh! And tomorrow, we can have a friendship brunch! What's your favorite kind of omelette cupcake?! [hushed] Mine's jalape<f1>o red velvet!"
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,starlight glimmer,"Yeah, um, I-I don't know if I can make it."
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,You'll change your minds when you smell the yummy food! Come on!
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,starlight glimmer,Oops.
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,"Tomorrow's brunch is going to be the scrumptiest, brunchiest, munchiest brunch ever!"
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,maud pie,[deadpan] Yeah. About that...
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,maud pie,[deadpan] Zero times.
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,"Oh, Maud, don't be so hard on yourself! You've got the best friendship-maker in Ponyville on the case! I'll be by your side the whole time! Speaking of which, your bell fell off, silly!"
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,maud pie,"[deadpan] Pinkie Pie, I appreciate what you're trying to do, but<U+0097>"
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,Buuuuuut?
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,maud pie,[deadpan] [sighs] Never mind.
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,"Don't worry, Maud. When you see this brunch, you'll realize everything's gonna be okay! And then, I have amazing bonding activities planned for the next seventeen days! You and Starlight will be besties in no time! Goodnight! [kisses] [clap, clap] [snoring] ...Cupcake omelette..."
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,Friendship brunch!
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,maud pie,"[deadpan] [voiceover] Pinkie Pie. Thank you for trying so hard to help me make friends. But my decision has to be rock based. And Ghastly Gorge has such great rocks, I won't even have time for friends. It's better this way. Sorry it didn't work out. Maud."
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,Maud! Wait!
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,Maud! [tearing up] Maud...
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,"Starlight, wake up!"
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,starlight glimmer,[yelps] Kites!
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,starlight glimmer,"Huh? Oh. If this is about brunch, I-I, uh... You know what? Jalape<f1>o red velvet omelettes sound gross. I-I just can't."
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,Maud left in the middle of the night!
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,starlight glimmer,Oh. I guess Ghastly Gorge really does have the best rocks.
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,[sniffs] Why couldn't you two just be friends?
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,starlight glimmer,"Pinkie Pie, I like Maud."
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,You do?
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,starlight glimmer,Yeah. She's weird!
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,Hey!
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,starlight glimmer,"No, in a good way! She sees the world in a totally different way than anypony I've ever met. She accepts me for who I am. She taught me that a rock is never just a rock, and she could make anything funny. We never had to say it, but we got each other."
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,You really were becoming friends?
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,starlight glimmer,"I think so, but you kinda sorta... got in the way."
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,starlight glimmer,"[gasps] You're right, too harsh. Let's go with... You ruined everything all the time?"
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,starlight glimmer,"Mmmmh, that's worse. What I'm trying to say is<U+0097>"
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,[tearing up] I have to go!
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,maud pie,[deadpan] Sigh.
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,maud pie,[deadpan] Emerald jasper? This must be my lucky day.
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,[sniffs] [licks] [chews] Maud tracks!
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,maud pie,"[deadpan] Hello, Pinkie Pie. I found emerald jasper."
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,"Are you okay, Maud?! That eel almost ate you!"
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,maud pie,[deadpan] What eel?
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,maud pie,[deadpan] You didn't need to come. I'm having a great time on my own.
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,maud pie,[deadpan] I even made a new friend.
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,Is it a rock?
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,maud pie,[deadpan] Yes.
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,[shrieks] Maud!
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,maud pie,[deadpan] I don't belong in Ponyville. It only proved I'm better off all by myself. Like I always have been.
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,"Don't say that! It was all my fault! I<U+0097> [shrieks] I thought I knew everything about making friends, but I didn't even know my own sister! I forced you to do things my way, but my way isn't your way!"
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,maud pie,[deadpan] This way.
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,Exactly!
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,maud pie,[deadpan] No. This way.
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,"Maud, I thought you couldn't make a friend without my help, but it turns out you couldn't make a friend with my help. I underestimated you, and I'm sorry."
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,maud pie,[deadpan] I know you did it out of love. You're my best sister friend forever.
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,maud pie,[deadpan] And you melt my heart more easily than sodium-rich plagioclase feldspar.
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,"[sniffs] I don't know what that means, but please please please please please give Ponyville another chance! But more importantly, give me another chance... to leave you alone."
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,maud pie,"[deadpan] What do you think, Boulder?"
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,starlight glimmer,You're back!
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,maud pie,[deadpan] Mm-hmm.
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,starlight glimmer,For good?
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,maud pie,"[deadpan] Mm-hmm. This doesn't mean we need to start talking about feelings, does it?"
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,starlight glimmer,Heh. No way.
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,maud pie,[deadpan] Maybe after this we could decorate my new place.
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,starlight glimmer,Totally! Where is it?
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,maud pie,"[deadpan] Well, it's not in Ponyville. More like Ponyville-adjacent."
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,starlight glimmer,It's perfect.
Rock Solid Friendship,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,"Sorry, sorry, I'm leaving! I promise. I'm not even here. Aah, you're wearing the slippers! Okay, now I'm really leaving. Buh-bye!"
Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,fluttershy,Oh! Be careful!
Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,fluttershy,"[gasps] Are you okay, Angel?"
Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,fluttershy,"I told you that entering the Ponyville Parkour Contest was a dangerous idea. You just rest here, and I'll have you all fixed up in no time. Oh, dear. I'm all out of bunny foot braces. I think we need to pay a visit to Dr. Fauna."
Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,fluttershy,"[straining] Oh, I was sure she would be here today."
Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,fluttershy,Hello? [knocks on door] Is anypony there?
Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,fluttershy,"[straining] I wish I could say the same, but the door's stuck, so I, um... can't see you."
Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,fluttershy,[gasps] You really have your hooves full here.
Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,fluttershy,I just can't believe all these poor little animals are hurt. What happened?
Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,fluttershy,"Oh, dear."
Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,fluttershy,They do seem to have made themselves right at home here.
Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,fluttershy,"Don't be silly, Dr. Fauna. You're the best vet pony in Equestria. At least that's what I've been telling everypony."
Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,fluttershy,"Oh, no. Do you suppose it's my fault? I'm so sorry. I didn't mean for this to happen. I just know animals feel safe and happy under your care."
Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,fluttershy,That is a big problem... that I'm going to fix for you! I already have the perfect solution that'll make the critters happy and give you more space. Then you'll have all your ducks in a row!
Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,fluttershy,I'm on it!
Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,fluttershy,I want to thank you all for rushing right over when I called.
Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,fluttershy,Dr. Fauna needs my help with a serious problem.
Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,twilight sparkle,A friendship problem?
Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,fluttershy,"No. Her vet clinic is a bit... maybe, um... overrun with adorable critters in dire need of a safe place to lay their heads, and... they don't have anywhere to go!"
Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,rarity,"Oh, that's just awful."
Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,fluttershy,I know!
Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,applejack,"Yeah. Dr. Fauna's always fixin' Winona up when she ain't feelin' too fine, so helpin' her out is A-okay by me."
Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,Hah! Yeah!
Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,rarity,You can count on us!
Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,pinkie pie,[simultaneously] Okie-dokie-lokie!
Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,twilight sparkle,[simultaneously] Okay!
Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,fluttershy,"Oh, that's great news! Because it means you'll all be helping me with something special, too. Something that's been a dream of mine for a long time."
Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,pinkie pie,"Oh, goody! Is your dream to make a bouncy castle shaped like a gigantic bundt cake?"
Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,fluttershy,"Um, no. Not exactly."
Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,pinkie pie,Huh. Just me then.
Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,"So? What is it, Fluttershy? Spill!"
Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,fluttershy,My dream is to build a real animal sanctuary.
Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,fluttershy,"A beautiful habitat where every animal <U+0096> whether sick or scared or even just lonely, feathered or furry, scaly or slimy <U+0096> every critter would be welcome. My sanctuary can be the one place in Equestria they call home 'til they feel ready to take on the world."
Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,twilight sparkle,"Wow, Fluttershy! I've never heard you speak with such conviction."
Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,rarity,Oh! That was exquisite!
Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,Pretty awesome.
Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,fluttershy,"Oh, thank you, everypony. You all taught me so much about building my confidence over the years. It's because of your friendship that I finally feel able to make my dream project a reality. But I can't build the sanctuary alone. Will you join me?"
Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,applejack,"I'm happy to offer my extra hooves to ya. Huh. But come to think of it, I actually know a filly who'd be more help than I would. She's a friend of mine from Winona's sheep-herdin' competitions <U+0096> Wrangler! Heh. She's an expert in animal enclosures."
Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,fluttershy,How lovely!
Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,pinkie pie,"Ooh-ooh-ooh! I know somepony, too! Hard Hat is the best construction pony in Ponyville. He can build anything you could ever, ever, ever want!"
Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,fluttershy,"Is it you, Rarity?"
Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,rarity,"[chuckles] No! No. Um, I was referring to the premiere interior designer of the Canterlot elite <U+0096> Dandy Grandeur. He helped me when I was setting up my Canterlot boutique. I know that he'd be thrilled to work with you."
Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,fluttershy,"Wow, everypony! Thank you! I can't wait to meet all of them and hear their ideas. We're right on track to building the most wonderful sanctuary in Equestria!"
Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,fluttershy,"Thank you, Rupert. Ahem. It's wonderful that you all could join me to discuss the Ponyville sanctuary project. My friends have so many nice things to say about each of your talents. This is a big project, so I'm happy to have such experienced ponies working on it with me."
Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,fluttershy,I-I think so.
Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,fluttershy,Of course.
Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,fluttershy,"Um, not exactly. It's more of a dream board."
Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,fluttershy,"Well, that's because it's not. It's a sanctuary. A place that is safe but not restrictive. Cozy but natural. A place where the animals can come and go as they please."
Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,fluttershy,"So, can you build it?"
Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,fluttershy,"I want the sanctuary to have an open floor plan. No walls. More like an enclosure that melts into the trees. With a gate in the back. That way, the animals can return to the forest right when they feel ready."
Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,pinkie pie,Sneaky! I like it!
Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,fluttershy,But I don't want to clear the trees. I want to use them.
Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,fluttershy,"Critters don't live the same way ponies do. I know this is unconventional, but that's because we're trying to do something that's never been done before. I really believe it'll work."
Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,pinkie pie,"See, Fluttershy? Whatever you want."
Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,fluttershy,Good.
Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,rarity,Ooooh! Loving the print on those!
Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,fluttershy,"Um, not to be rude, but there must be some mistake. We have no need for curtains at the sanctuary."
Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,fluttershy,"Everything is gonna look natural in the animal habitats, not like it was made for ponies."
Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,fluttershy,Drab? You're calling the colors of beautiful trees drab?
Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,fluttershy,"I appreciate your input, but I just know the animals would be happiest with dirt brown pillows and leaf green accents."
Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,fluttershy,Thank you.
Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,fluttershy,Hmm.
Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,applejack,"Uh, what is it, sugarcube?"
Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,fluttershy,I'm looking for something less like a cage and more like a nice hug. Maybe if we lose that part.
Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,fluttershy,Exactly! Ooh! This is the perfect base for a little nest. I'll take a bunch of these and anything else the animals can burrow into.
Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,applejack,"She does have a point there. You wouldn't want a bunny wanderin' into the wrong cave, would ya?"
Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,fluttershy,No! No cages. I want to give the animals the freedom to come and go. It's the only way they'll feel comfortable.
Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,applejack,"Well, she's the boss."
Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,fluttershy,"I... I... [angry] I don't love it! This is not going to work at all! A giraffe can't fit through this door! With these curtains blocking the light, how are the birds gonna sing in the sunshine? And this is the opposite of a nice hug! I know you all worked hard, but none of you did anything I asked for!"
Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,fluttershy,"I may not know much about construction or interior design or wrangling, but I am an expert at one thing: the care of animals! And what animals need is a sanctuary, not this!"
Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,fluttershy,"My vision isn't the problem here! I told you all exactly what I wanted, and none of you listened to me! So while I appreciate your efforts, I no longer require your services!"
Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,fluttershy,No. I'm the one who should be sorry. This didn't go at all like I had imagined.
Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,fluttershy,"Sleep tight, little one. It's going to be okay. I promise."
Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,fluttershy,"Now, now, every mouse has gotta wait their turn."
Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,fluttershy,[sighs] I'm so sorry. I thought I'd have a beautiful sanctuary for you all to stay in by now. But I put my trust in the wrong ponies.
Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,fluttershy,No!
Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,fluttershy,"I won't give up! These animals need me! And I'm gonna solve this once and for all! If this little lady can crawl all the way here from Western Equestria, I can find a way to build her a safe place to rest!"
Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,fluttershy,Oh! [joins in laughter] Oops. Everyone back to sleep now.
Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,fluttershy,"Thanks for coming, everypony. As you know, building the sanctuary didn't go quite as planned."
Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,pinkie pie,"I know, right? Who would've guessed that Hard Hat wouldn't build whatever you want?"
Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,rarity,I never would've invited Dandy to help if I thought he'd act in such a manner.
Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,applejack,"[sighs] And Wrangler sure made a fool outta me, too. I'm sorry, Fluttershy."
Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,fluttershy,It's okay. You were all just trying to help. But I know that letting all the experts go was the right call.
Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,twilight sparkle,So what are you gonna do now?
Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,fluttershy,Try again. I'm going to rebuild the sanctuary and do it my way this time.
Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,pinkie pie,"All right, Fluttershy!"
Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,applejack,"[simultaneously] You show 'em, filly!"
Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,rarity,[simultaneously] That's the spirit!
Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,How about putting an awesome flying course for the birds right there?
Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,pinkie pie,And a carrot cake stand here?
Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,twilight sparkle,"Ooh, a library cave?"
Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,fluttershy,"Everypony, stop! I appreciate you sharing your thoughts, but I need everypony to respect mine. Other ponies may be experts in their fields, but animals are my field of expertise. And if I say this is what I want, then this is what needs to happen! Oh, um, for the animals of course."
Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,pinkie pie,"Wow! We should call you ""Flutterbold"" now!"
Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,fluttershy,"To get things back on track, I called in a favor from an old friend. He'll be here any minute."
Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,twilight sparkle,I thought you said no more experts.
Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,fluttershy,This is one expert I know I can trust to put the animals first. Plus there's nopony better at building.
Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,twilight sparkle,Big Daddy McColt! [to the others] We met each other back when the map called me and Fluttershy to the Smokey Mountains!
Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,fluttershy,And he certainly knows his stuff when it comes to buildings and caring for animals.
Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,fluttershy,Are you ready?
Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,fluttershy,"Okay, you can open your eyes! Welcome to Sweet Feather Sanctuary, a safe and cozy retreat for everycreature!"
Fluttershy Leans In,Gillian M. Berrow,fluttershy,"Now you should have plenty of room at the clinic. Because once you've treated them, they can recover here! With my help, of course. It's okay, Lola. We all move at our own pace. Sometimes, all we need to do is believe in our dreams. And when we finally reach our goal, we'll know that it was worth what it took to get there, because the view will be even better than you imagined!"
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,sassy saddles,"[panting] [muttering] Oh, I have to... Oh! I can't believe the winter-to-spring transition is almost here!"
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,sassy saddles,"Ohhh. I like that. [sighs] I'm going to have to relabel all my binders. Right after we finish... everything! We still have so much to do! Oh, my bustles and bows! Rarity, did we<U+0097>?"
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,rarity,"Already hemmed, ruched, and cut, my dear."
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,sassy saddles,"[sighs] Oh. Rarity, no reason to panic, but, um, we seem to be temporarily low! And when I say ""temporarily low"", I mean ""completely out of""<U+0097>!"
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,rarity,The baby blue sapphires? They arrived this morning.
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,sassy saddles,Oh. Heh. Wonderful. [sighs] Oh! What about the design for the<U+0097>?!
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,rarity,And done!
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,sassy saddles,Wow. You are good. And you've really outdone yourself this time! The Morning Sunshine Tulip Frock is gorgeous!
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,rarity,"Ooh, thank you. Look, I know you're worried about something slipping between the cracks. But with your managerial skills and my fabulous designs, we have everything covered."
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,sassy saddles,You're right. You're right. There are no cracks.
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,rarity,Would you be a dear and fetch me some vermilion satin from the back? And I'll start on the Eternal Elegance Empire Silhouette evening gown.
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,sassy saddles,My most certain pleasure!
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,sassy saddles,"Rarity, we're running low on vermilion satin."
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,sassy saddles,I... I can order more!
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,rarity,"[continues bawling] And this is when we pretended we were storybook princesses. And here we pretended we were on a dangerous yet stylish safari. [sobs] So many wonderful memories! [sobs, blows nose, resumes sobbing] Not to put too fine a point on it, but... [bawls harder] Sweetie Belle loves playing dress-up. I miss her so much!"
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,sassy saddles,Then why don't you go visit her?
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,rarity,"[through tears] I wish I... could, but... between... running... three stores and the spring-sition... I couldn't possibly..."
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,sassy saddles,But you've already done almost all the work. I can handle the rest.
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,rarity,B-B-But... but...
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,sassy saddles,"Rarity, go. I have everything well in hoof."
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,rarity,"[sobs, calmer] Mm, point taken. [excitedly] I am going to visit my sister!"
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,sassy saddles,Way to immediately turn that around.
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,rarity,We can spend the whole day together! And we can do all her favorite things!
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,sassy saddles,I'm sure she'd love that.
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,rarity,"Oh, Sassy, thank you!"
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,sassy saddles,Of course! Now get out of here!
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,rarity,"I'm going! I'm going! Hang on, sis! I'm coming!"
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,scootaloo,Excuse us!
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,apple bloom,Comin' through!
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,sweetie belle,Cutie Mark Crusaders mid-mission here!
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,scootaloo,That was fun! Let's do it again!
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,sweetie belle,"Scoot, we've got a job to do."
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,scootaloo,Later?
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,sweetie belle,"All right, Chipcutter. We've done our part. The rest is up to you."
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,scootaloo,Yup!
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,sweetie belle,"Because you said you weren't good at anything except getting in trouble for making sculptures out of your lunch, right?"
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,apple bloom,"Well, what is this slab asking you to turn it into?"
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,apple bloom,Wow! T-That's incredible! It looks just like us!
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,scootaloo,"We knew you had it in you, Chip!"
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,sweetie belle,"Chip, we're proud of you."
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,apple bloom,Woo-hoo! All right!
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,scootaloo,Yes!
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,sweetie belle,Way to go!
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,scootaloo,[sighs] Not a bad way to start a day.
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,apple bloom,Not a bad way at all! Helpin' ponies is just about my favorite thing to do.
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,sweetie belle,Another satisfied client!
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,apple bloom,So who's up next?
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,sweetie belle,Pretty sure it's Zipporwhill. She needs help reconnecting with her cutie mark <U+0096> three puppy paw prints.
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,scootaloo,When is she swinging by?
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,sweetie belle,"Well, I think she should be arriving right about..."
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,sweetie belle,...now.
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,apple bloom,Wow. You are good.
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,sweetie belle,"Come on in, Zipporwhill."
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,scootaloo,"Okay, so what seems to be the problem, exactly?"
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,scootaloo,Don't you worry. You've come to the right place! The Cutie Mark Crusaders are on the job!
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,apple bloom,"Trust us. Before you know it, you and your puppy will be back to bein' besties!"
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,sweetie belle,"You have the CMC guarantee! No matter what it takes, we promise you'll have our full attention."
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,rarity,[singsongy] Guess who's here to spend the whole day with her little sister?!
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,rarity,Mmmm!
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,sweetie belle,"Rarity, what are you doing here?"
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,rarity,"I am here to spend the day with you! I'm so excited, I could practically faint! You don't happen to have a fainting couch in here, do you?"
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,sweetie belle,No!
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,rarity,"Oh, pfft, of course not. It's a treehouse! That would be tr<e8>s gauche!"
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,sweetie belle,"Right... Well, I sure am happy to see you, and spending the day with you does sound like a lot of fun, but... I'm kind of right in the middle of something important. I have responsibilities and..."
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,rarity,Oh.
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,apple bloom,"Go on, Sweetie Belle. We've got this covered. How often do you get to spend time with your sister?"
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,scootaloo,Yeah! Go have fun.
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,sweetie belle,You sure you two can handle our client here?
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,rarity,"""Client""? Oh, that is so adorable!"
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,sweetie belle,"Uh, thanks? I think?"
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,sweetie belle,Are you sure you two got this?
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,apple bloom,We have it handled.
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,rarity,"Oh, my! Look at this wall of satisfied customers! [gasps] You girls really have come a long way."
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,sweetie belle,"Well, all right then. [to the other Crusaders] But, lemme know if you need me or run into any trouble."
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,rarity,Ooh! So fun!
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,sweetie belle,[indignantly] What?
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,rarity,[giggles] It's just I know how much you love these puppet shows.
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,sweetie belle,I did.
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,rarity,"Oh, it's just like old times! You, me, greasy popcorn. It's like no time has passed at all."
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,rarity,Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! It's your favorite part!
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,rarity,"What's the matter, darling?"
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,sweetie belle,"I, um, guess I just prefer black box experimental theater."
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,rarity,What?! Since when?
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,sweetie belle,[sighs] I dunno. It's no big deal. This is great.
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,rarity,"Okay. We're here! Ta-da! [laughs, clears throat] Aren't you excited to be back here again? Do I know my baby sister, or do I know my baby sister?"
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,sweetie belle,"Uh... Yeah... Where is ""here"" exactly?"
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,rarity,"Oh, pfft! Stop being so silly! You know this is your favorite ice cream shop!"
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,sweetie belle,Oh. Right. From when I was a little filly.
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,sweetie belle,Huh. I remember it being much bigger.
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,rarity,"Well, go ahead. I know you're dying to dig in."
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,rarity,Well?
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,sweetie belle,"[laughs nervously, sighs] That was, uh... one tasty bite. Still a little hungry, though."
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,rarity,"[gasps] We can get another sundae! Chocolate with rainbow sprinkles, perhaps?"
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,sweetie belle,I was thinking something more like a salad.
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,rarity,A salad? When did you get so practical?
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,sweetie belle,"Oh, um... I guess another scoop would be fine!"
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,rarity,"[gasps] One more Filly Clown Surprise, please!"
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,scootaloo,Look at me! Over here!
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,rarity,"I know you must be bored, darling. This is a very long line for one of Twisty Pop's balloons."
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,rarity,"But just be patient. We'll get you your favorite balloon bouquet, and it'll all be worth it."
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,scootaloo,"Come on, Ripley! Like this!"
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,apple bloom,Good Scootaloo! See?
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,scootaloo,Maybe if the ball tasted better?
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,apple bloom,"I don't think that that's it, Scoot."
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,sweetie belle,Doesn't look like it's going so well. I'm just gonna do a quick check with the CMCs.
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,rarity,"Well, I guess duty calls, and-and you, you have that now..."
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,sweetie belle,What?
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,rarity,"Oh nothing, nothing. Go on."
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,scootaloo,"Hey, Sweetie Belle. How's your day with Rarity going?"
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,sweetie belle,"Well, it's not exactly great..."
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,apple bloom,What do you mean?
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,sweetie belle,I don't know. It's like Rarity doesn't even know me anymore.
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,scootaloo,I wish we could say our day is going better.
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,apple bloom,But we can't.
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,scootaloo,Seems like Zipporwhill's puppy doesn't want anything to do with her.
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,sweetie belle,"Hmmm. I see what you mean... [gasps] You know, it's an awfully big puppy..."
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,rarity,"Sweetie Belle, hurry! He's making it!"
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,sweetie belle,Gotta go...
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,rarity,[gasps] I know just what to do with this!
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,rarity,And pose!
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,rarity,And pose!
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,rarity,Love the camera!
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,rarity,Hate the camera.
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,rarity,Love it again!
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,rarity,"Sweetie Belle, you did ""hate the camera"" for all these shots! [sighs] Let's do it again."
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,sweetie belle,No!
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,apple bloom,"Come on, Zipporwhill, you can do this!"
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,rarity,"W-What do you mean, no?"
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,sweetie belle,"Rarity, this is hard for me to say, but... um..."
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,rarity,"Sweetie Belle, what is it? You've been acting weird all day. You used to love doing these things with me."
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,sweetie belle,That's just it! I used to! That's not who I am anymore!
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,rarity,But it is you! You love puppet shows and dressing up and taking silly photos and tiny little clown-shaped ice creams!
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,sweetie belle,"Really?! If you still think I like doing this stuff, then maybe you don't know me at all!"
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,rarity,"[sobbing] I can't believe Sweetie Belle talked to me like that. [indignant] And after everything I did to set up a whole day of doing her favorite things! I mean, accusing me of not knowing her?! I know her better than anypony! Um, thank you, Twisty, but the hard truth is, my sister is being unappreciative right now! And I'm going to go and give her a piece of my mind!"
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,sweetie belle,"Hey, Zipporwhill. What are you doing here? Where are Apple Bloom and Scootaloo?"
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,sweetie belle,"Now, I'm sure that's not true."
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,sweetie belle,I think that might be your problem right there! Come on!
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,scootaloo,"[groans] Find Zipporwhill, Ripley!"
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,apple bloom,"Woof, woof! It's Zipporwhill! Woof?"
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,scootaloo,[sighs] It's hopeless.
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,apple bloom,Sweetie Belle!
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,scootaloo,Zipporwhill! [sighs] We're sorry we haven't figured this out yet.
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,sweetie belle,"Don't worry, girls. I think I cracked this one."
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,rarity,"Aha! There she is! [gasps] Oh, dear. Really should have changed. [huffs] No matter! I'm going to give her quite the talking to! ...Right after she's done with her conversation. Anger is no excuse for poor manners, after all."
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,sweetie belle,"Okay, Zipporwhill. What do you see?"
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,sweetie belle,That's not what I see. I see a full-grown dog.
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,sweetie belle,"He's not just bigger. He's older, too."
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,sweetie belle,"You don't still play with the same toys from when you were a foal, do you?"
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,sweetie belle,I understand. But doing things like you used to won't turn him back into a puppy.
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,sweetie belle,"Treat him like the dog he is, and find new favorite things to do together."
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,rarity,I know so!
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,sweetie belle,Rarity?!
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,rarity,"Oh, Sweetie Belle. I heard what you said, and you are so right."
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,scootaloo,About the dog?
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,rarity,"Yes, but about us, too. The truth is, I know you're not a little filly anymore. But it's just... the last time we did all of those things together, I... I didn't realize it was gonna be the last last time. I loved doing those things with you. It's hard for me to let that go."
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,sweetie belle,"Aww, Rarity! I love being with you too! That will never change! But... maybe we could just try to do different things together?"
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,cutie mark crusaders,No problem!
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,rarity,"Sweetie Belle, I'm so very proud of the pony you've grown into."
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,sweetie belle,"And I'm proud that no matter what, I'll always be your little sister."
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,rarity,"I, uh, have a little bit of time before I have to head back to Canterlot. Could we spend it together? What would a grown pony like you want to do?"
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,sweetie belle,"Well, I do have one idea..."
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,rarity,"Heh, I didn't realize your idea would be such a delicious one! [giggles] I don't know how I'm going to finish this."
Forever Filly,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,sweetie belle,Oh! I'll help you!
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,apple bloom,[straining] Scootaloo... is this such a... good idea?
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,scootaloo,What are you talking about? This is the best idea I've ever had!
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,apple bloom,[grunting] It's just...
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,scootaloo,You wanna come. But we talked about this. Non-Pegasus ponies fall through the clouds.
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,apple bloom,"Right, but..."
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,sweetie belle,I think we're good.
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,apple bloom,"We are? Scootaloo, I know you have to go to Cloudsdale to finish your report. I'm just wonderin' if this is the best way to get there."
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,scootaloo,"It'll be fine. Besides, how else could I get there?"
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,apple bloom,A Pegasus chariot?
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,sweetie belle,A flock of birds?
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,apple bloom,A hot-air balloon?
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,scootaloo,Huh. Those do seem a lot safer. Maybe I should try to find another waaaaaaaaayyyyyy!
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,scootaloo,Woo-hoo!
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,scootaloo,"[grunts, weakly] Nailed it."
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,bow hothoof,"[echoing] Uh, little ma'am, are you all right?"
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,scootaloo,[gasps] You're... You're... You're... Rainbow Dash's dad!
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,bow hothoof,"Uh, yes. Bow Hothoof at your service."
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,bow hothoof,"Uh, honey? Somethin's goin' on out here!"
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,windy whistles,"Oh! Heavens to Celestia, what's wrong with her?!"
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,bow hothoof,"I don't know, but you just made it worse."
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,bow hothoof,She's doing it again!
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,windy whistles,"Oh, dearie, please! You might shatter my Princess Celestia commemorative plates! Ow!"
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,bow hothoof,Our Rainbow Dash?
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,scootaloo,"The report's on an inspirational pony in my life, and nopony inspires me more than she does! I'm putting together this scrapbook for my report! I'm her biggest fan!"
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,bow hothoof,"Now, little trotter, what you say is impossible. [excitedly] Because nopony is a bigger fan of our Rainbow Dash than us!"
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,scootaloo,Whoa! You always wear that shirt?
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,bow hothoof,"Heh. Actually, it's, uh, laundry day. But pretty great, right?!"
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,scootaloo,Yeah!
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,windy whistles,"My name's Windy Whistles, and I just have to say that it is a total blast to meet somepony that loves Rainbow Dash as much as we do!"
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,bow hothoof,What can we help you with?
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,scootaloo,"Well, I know all about Rainbow Dash's time in Ponyville, but I don't know anything about her life before that."
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,bow hothoof,"Well, you came to the right place!"
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,scootaloo,I can't believe I'm eating Rainbow Dash's favorite food made by Rainbow Dash's mom while sitting in Rainbow Dash's childhood kitchen! This is the greatest day of my life! [munches loudly] Mmmm!
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,bow hothoof,I think it's time for a tour of the house.
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,scootaloo,[mouth full] Okay.
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,bow hothoof,Our little Dashie was an early learner and so rambunctious. The combination was<U+0097>
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,windy whistles,[singsongy] Exciting!
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,scootaloo,Whoa... Is that... her room?
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,scootaloo,"[screams] Rainbow Dash's linen closet! Her carpet! Her inspirational poster! [reading] ""When the going gets tough, the tough don't notice because they have hard shells."" That's so Rainbow Dash!"
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,scootaloo,Woo-hoo!
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,bow hothoof,"Scootaloo, wanna see something really cool?"
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,bow hothoof,"Pretty great, huh?"
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,scootaloo,So great!
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,windy whistles,And look at this! She was wearing it when she spoke her first words.
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,scootaloo,So cool!
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,windy whistles,And this broken lantern is from when she first learned to fly.
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,windy whistles,And this bitten apple is from when she grew her first tooth! [gasps] So many memories!
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,scootaloo,You're so lucky to have all of these!
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,windy whistles,"Well, I may have a ton of Dash-mentos, but I don't have any of those ""Rainbow Dash Saves Ponyville"" headlines like you."
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,scootaloo,[gasps] Trade-sies?
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,windy whistles,Deal-sies!
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,scootaloo,So where's all the Wonderbolt stuff?
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,bow hothoof,You mean Rainbow Dash's personal collection of Wonderbolt memorabilia?
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,scootaloo,"No. I mean, where's all the stuff about Rainbow Dash getting accepted into the Wonderbolt Academy and then getting chosen as a Wonderbolt? Wait, you don't know that your daughter's a Wonderbolt? And I got to tell you?!"
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,scootaloo,"Oh, wow! You should see your faces right now!"
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,scootaloo,See? That's what your faces look like.
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,bow hothoof,Great timing.
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,scootaloo,Great door.
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,windy whistles,I just... It's... Unbelievable!
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,scootaloo,"You two were kind enough to show me the Rainbow Dash you know. Now please, allow me to show you the Rainbow Dash I know."
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,spitfire,Let's make some thunder!
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,rainbow dash,I was born to make thunder!
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,bow hothoof,Our baby's a Wonderbolt!
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,spitfire,We've got turbulence!
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,rainbow dash,How? Where's it coming from?
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,bow hothoof,I'm so proud!
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,rainbow dash,"Oh, no."
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,spitfire,Okay. Which pony broke protocol and invited guests to our training exercises?!
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,rainbow dash,"I guess they're with me. [groans, embarrassed] Mom, Dad. So... good... to see you."
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,windy whistles,"Oh, honey, it's so great to see you, too! And wow! You were so amazing up there with all of that flying!"
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,rainbow dash,"Uh, how did you know I was here?"
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,windy whistles,"Scootaloo filled us in on everything, you modest pony you!"
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,scootaloo,I can't believe I'm documenting the moment your parents first saw you as a Wonderbolt!
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,windy whistles,"And these must be your Wonderbolt friends! Hello, team! I'm Windy Whistles, the mom of the best Wonderbolt ever! Yeah! Just kidding. You guys were great, too! Go, team!"
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,rainbow dash,Moooom!
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,spitfire,"Hello, ma'am. Nice to meet you."
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,windy whistles,"Nice to meet you as well, and love those goggles! Love 'em! You know, I have goggles, too. But they're mostly just for swimming. Oh, and bath time."
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,rainbow dash,"Mom, please! They don't wanna hear about your bath time!"
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,bow hothoof,"I can't believe it! My daughter, a Wonderbolt! [sobs] So proud!"
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,rainbow dash,"Dad, hold it together. We're in public."
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,spitfire,"All right, Wonderbolts! Let's hit the showers and give Rainbow Dash some time to spend with her family."
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,rainbow dash,"Okay, yeah! Uh, great practice! I'll, uh, eh, catch up with you guys in a minute!"
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,bow hothoof,"Oh, no! [straining] Tears... welling up again!"
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,rainbow dash,Dad!
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,rainbow dash,Could you give us a sec?
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,scootaloo,Is something wrong?
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,rainbow dash,Yeah. You should've warned me that you were bringing my parents! Or talked to Twilight or something! Not just shown up!
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,scootaloo,Why?
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,rainbow dash,"Ugh! It's just my parents and I have a delicate relationship. I love them very much, and we're really close, but there's a reason I didn't tell them I'm a Wonderbolt! They can be a little bit... embarrassing."
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,scootaloo,Huh? Really?
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,rainbow dash,"Yeah, really! And now you've invited a whole lot of crazy into my life!"
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,scootaloo,What's wrong with a little support?
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,scootaloo,"Bow and Windy, I'd like you to meet Apple Bloom and Sweetie Belle."
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,apple bloom,Hi!
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,sweetie belle,Hello.
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,bow hothoof,"Greetings, small ponies."
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,apple bloom,Are you excited to see Rainbow Dash?
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,windy whistles,"Oh, my, yes! And to think we never bothered to come to a Wonderbolt event!"
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,bow hothoof,"We said if Rainbow Dash isn't a Wonderbolt, then what's the point? But now, she is!"
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,scootaloo,"And she earned it! Did you know it all started when she won a spot in the coveted Wonderbolts Academy, training under Spitfire?"
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,windy whistles,I didn't know that! How wonderful!
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,scootaloo,"But then, she had some heavy competition. Especially against another Pegasus named Lightning Dust."
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,windy whistles,"Oh, no!"
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,scootaloo,"But, of course, Rainbow Dash proved to be the best and later made it into the Wonderbolt Reserves!"
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,windy whistles,Hooray again!
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,scootaloo,"But jealous ex-Wonderbolt Wind Rider was worried that Rainbow Dash might break his speed record. And so, he framed her for a crime she didn't commit."
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,windy whistles,"Oh, no!"
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,scootaloo,"But thanks to Rarity, Rainbow Dash proved her innocence and became a backup Wonderbolt until Fire Streak retired, and she became an official Wonderbolt!"
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,windy whistles,"Hooray! Wow, what a gripping tale!"
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,bow hothoof,You really know your Rainbow Dash history. You're going to do great on your report.
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,apple bloom,Show's about to start.
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,bow hothoof,"Come on, Bolts! Let's start this thing!"
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,windy whistles,Wonderbolts' Big Showcase! Here! We! Gooooooooo!
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,bow hothoof,Rip it up and tear! It! Down!
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,windy whistles,Then build it back up again and tear it back down again! Yeah!
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,bow hothoof,"Woo! Yeah! Uh-huh, uh-huh! Go go go! Yes! Go, Rainbow Dash! Best Wonderbolt ever!"
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,windy whistles,"Woo-hoo! That's my daughter! Go, Rainbow! Go, Dashie, go-go-go-go-go!"
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,windy whistles,"You go, girl!"
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,spitfire,Whoa! Since when did we add fireworks to the show?!
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,rainbow dash,"Uhhhh, we didn't."
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,bow hothoof,"Go, Rainbow Dash! You sign that photo! Whoo!"
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,bow hothoof,"Now, let's do the pyramid! Scootaloo, get up there! You're the top!"
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,spitfire,[to Rainbow] You really do got yourself your very own mega-fans. Lucky you.
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,windy whistles,You hung that towel!
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,windy whistles,Yeah!
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,bow hothoof,Greatest towel hanger of all time! [chanting] Towel!
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,rainbow dash,"Stop! This is ridiculous! Mom and Dad, you are both too supportive! This is exactly why I didn't tell you I was a Wonderbolt! You're just... too much!"
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,windy whistles,Did... Did we do something wrong?
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,rainbow dash,"Yes! The fireworks, the cheerleading, and-and how do you even compare who is better or worse at hanging up a towel?!"
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,bow hothoof,We're just trying to be supportive.
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,rainbow dash,"Well, I'm tired of it! I've had enough of you two being so proud of every little ridiculous, insignificant thing I do! [pants] I think you should leave."
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,windy whistles,"First of all, great job yelling at us, sweetie. No one [sniffs] can make their parents feel more worthless than you!"
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,bow hothoof,"[through tears] Your words were direct, clear, and... so painful! Is there nothing you can't do?!"
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,scootaloo,Why?
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,rainbow dash,"Scootaloo, you don't understand!"
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,scootaloo,"I met your parents hoping to learn more about you, but I don't like what I found out! I'll find somepony else to do my hero report on."
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,rainbow dash,"[panting] Scootaloo, wait! I know I wasn't myself back there, and I shouldn't have snapped at my parents! That's exactly why I didn't tell them I'm a Wonderbolt!"
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,scootaloo,I don't understand. They're so proud of you.
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,rainbow dash,[sighs] Can I tell you something?
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,scootaloo,Sure.
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,rainbow dash,"Okay, but you might wanna hold onto your wings because this could rock you to your very core. Believe it or not, there was a time when I wasn't the best at everything."
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,rainbow dash,"See this picture? It looks like I won something awesome, but actually..."
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,bow hothoof,Greatest participant ever!
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,rainbow dash,"Granted, I was the youngest pony in the senior competitive circuit. Most other ponies my age were still in the Junior Flappers' Club. I thought it was utterly mortifying having my parents cheer me on even when I lost!"
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,rainbow dash,"[voiceover] But then, when I started to win competitions <U+0096> which didn't take very long, by the way <U+0096> things got even worse!"
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,rainbow dash,"[voiceover] Being the best came with consequences. Very loud, very embarrassing consequences."
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,scootaloo,"Ya know, some ponies would dream of having parents like that."
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,rainbow dash,"Yeah, right! Name one!"
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,scootaloo,"[sighs] Me. Growing up, I never thought I'd be the best at anything, because nopony ever told me. But your parents told you over and over again. Look! Best bath taker ever. Best carrot eater under three. Greatest napper of all time!"
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,rainbow dash,[scoffs] I am pretty good at napping. I can fall asleep anywhere. [snores] Huh?
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,scootaloo,"For your entire life, your parents gave you the confidence to believe in yourself."
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,rainbow dash,"You're right. I was always so embarrassed by my parents that I didn't realize their support actually made me the awesome, confident, amazing, awesome, and awesome pony I am! [sighs] And I took them for granted."
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,scootaloo,And you yelled at them.
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,rainbow dash,"[groans] I gotta make this right. I have an idea, but I'm gonna need your help. That is, if you're willing to help me after I acted like that."
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,scootaloo,"Now, that's a great picture! ""Rainbow Dash learns the error of her ways""!"
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,windy whistles,"I'm telling you, I just can't see a thing. Scootaloo, you are just so great at blindfolds!"
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,bow hothoof,"It's true. You must tell me what kind of knot you used. Uh, falconer's knot? Wait, no! A farmer's loop!"
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,windy whistles,"What's this all about, anywho?"
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,rainbow dash,"[over loudspeaker] Windy Whistles and Bow Hothoof, please be seated for a super private Wonderbolt event! [clears throat] Mom and Dad, welcome to the... [quickly] ""I Love My Parents and I'm Sorry That I Took Them for Granted and I Know That They Made Me Who I Am Today So I Really Wanna Make It Up to Them""... [normally] event. Enjoy!"
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,rainbow dash,Thanks for doing this.
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,spitfire,Happy to help.
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,rainbow dash,"Mom and Dad, I want you to know that I'm your biggest fan."
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,windy whistles,"Oh, honey, thank you. But you didn't have to do all this. It's kind of [whispers] embarrassing."
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,bow hothoof,"Eh, it is a bit much."
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,scootaloo,And that's why Rainbow Dash is the most inspirational pony in my life!
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,cheerilee,"Thank you, Scootaloo. Very well researched! But a little heavy on the pictures, and there was a moldy sandwich in your report. [chuckles] Um, I'll give you a B."
Parental Glideance,Josh Hamilton,rainbow dash,Yeah! Greatest report giver of all time!
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,sweetie belle,"Hey, Apple Bloom! Rarity's reorganizing her shop, and look what she found! Old costumes from the talent show!"
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,scootaloo,We thought they'd come in handy in case we ever help a pony put on a play or need to make a quick escape disguised as clowns.
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,apple bloom,"Here ya go, Big Mac."
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,scootaloo,"Whoa, that sure is a lot of apples!"
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,apple bloom,Are you makin' another delivery to Starlight's old village?
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,big mcintosh,Eeyup.
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,sweetie belle,"That's an awful long way for a pony to go, isn't it?"
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,big mcintosh,Eeyup.
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,apple bloom,"You've been goin' there a lot lately. What is this, your fifth trip this week?"
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,big mcintosh,[laughs nervously] Eeyup.
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,apple bloom,"Okay, well, have fun. So what other costumes did you bring, Sweetie Belle?"
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,scootaloo,Are you crazy?! We can't talk about costumes at a time like this!
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,apple bloom,Time like what?
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,scootaloo,Your brother is hiding something. Did you see the way he was acting?
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,sweetie belle,Yeah. He totally blushed when you brought up how often he's been going to Starlight's old village.
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,scootaloo,"Something is definitely going on. There can be only be one reason a pony would travel so far, so often."
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,apple bloom,...and he wants to get away from the smell!
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,scootaloo,Maybe he's a spy on a mission to thwart an evil villain with a secret weapon: an apple cannon!
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,apple bloom,"No, that's crazy! I think it's my broccoli thing."
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,sweetie belle,Why don't we just ask him?
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,scootaloo,"You saw how shifty he was acting earlier. There's no way he'll tell us what he's doing. Plus, I really wanna go undercover. We already have costumes! Call me ""Agent Rainbowhead""."
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,sweetie belle,"I'll be ""Shimmering Spectacles"", a librarian with a mysterious past."
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,apple bloom,And I'll be a pirate spy! Arrrgh! A spy-rate!
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,apple bloom,[gasps] Avast! Our ship be leavin' port!
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,scootaloo,Huh?
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,apple bloom,"Big Mac's leavin'! If we're gonna be spies, we gotta go! Now!"
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,apple bloom,Big Mac's a-comin'! Quick! Act like apples!
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,sweetie belle,What? How?
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,sweetie belle,Who's that pony?
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,scootaloo,Let me see! I dunno. Shouldn't have taken the binoculars. I don't know anypony here.
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,apple bloom,"That must be Sugar Belle. Applejack told me about her bakery. Obviously, she's just been orderin' a lot of apples."
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,sweetie belle,So nothing fishy's going on.
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,scootaloo,No way! We came here to be spies! And no spy I know has ever solved a case that quick!
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,sweetie belle,"Mmm, how many spies do you know?"
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,scootaloo,That's... not important. What's important is that we do more recon. Follow my lead!
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,apple bloom,Whoa. She sure likes her apples.
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,sweetie belle,What is she doing? Making the biggest apple pie in Equestria?
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,sugar belle,"Thanks for coming all this way, Big Mac."
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,sugar belle,It sure is nice seeing you again so soon.
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,sugar belle,"All I used to bake were boring old muffins, but thanks to your apple deliveries, I get to bake all kinds of delicious treats! Apple pies, apple fritters, apple turnovers, caramel apples, caramel apple cakes... [sighs] I just wish I had more room to display it all. My shelves only hold so much."
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,apple bloom,"I'm tellin' you, this pony reeeeaaally likes her apples."
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,sweetie belle,[gasps] Or Big Mac!
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,sweetie belle,Just look!
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,apple bloom,"Sweetie Belle, I-I think you're right! [loudly] I think my brother has a crush!"
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,sweetie belle,Shh!
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,apple bloom,"Psst! Big Mac! [to the Crusaders] Now remember, my brother's super shy, so he's probably gonna be embarrassed about his crush. Just try and make him feel comfortable. Hey, Big Mac, it's me! Apple Bloom!"
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,big mcintosh,Eeyup.
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,big mcintosh,Mm-hmm.
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,apple bloom,"I'm gonna ask you a very personal question, and I want you to answer honestly. Do you... have a crush on... Sugar Belle?"
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,big mcintosh,Eeyup.
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,scootaloo,"Well, that was easy."
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,apple bloom,This is so excitin'! My big brother has his very first crush!
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,scootaloo,First crush? What about Cheerilee?
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,sweetie belle,"It doesn't really count when you trick a pony into drinking a love potion, does it?"
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,big mcintosh,[angrily] Nnope!
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,apple bloom,[singsongy] My brother has a crush! My brother has a crush! My brother has a crush! [normally] Wait! Does Sugar Belle even know you like her?
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,big mcintosh,Uh-uh.
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,apple bloom,Then you gotta tell her!
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,big mcintosh,O-Oh... eh... ehhhh...
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,sweetie belle,"We're pretty sure she likes you! I mean, she keeps ordering apples just so she can see you again."
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,big mcintosh,Eeeyou think so?
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,scootaloo,Totally! But you'll never know if you don't try.
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,big mcintosh,Okay!
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,scootaloo,"Go get her, Big Mac!"
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,sugar belle,"Oh! Heh. Thanks, Feather Bangs."
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,scootaloo,"Um, is it possible to have two crushes at once? Because it looks like Big Mac may not be the only pony Sugar Belle likes."
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,apple bloom,"Hey, Big Mac! Where ya goin'?"
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,big mcintosh,Home!
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,sweetie belle,You can't let that Feather fella get in the way of your one true love!
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,scootaloo,You've gotta take him down!
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,apple bloom,What can he do that you can't?
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,big mcintosh,That!
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,scootaloo,Seriously? That line worked?
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,big mcintosh,She'll never pick me.
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,apple bloom,"Sure she will, 'cause we're gonna help you."
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,big mcintosh,No love potions!
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,apple bloom,"Don't worry, Big Mac. We learned our lesson the hard way."
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,scootaloo,Yeah. We're never gonna do that again.
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,sweetie belle,"Besides, I know exactly what to do! When I was younger, I read all the fairy tales."
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,scootaloo,"When you were ""younger"", huh?"
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,sweetie belle,"Well, I was younger on the way here!"
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,sweetie belle,"It was a long ride! Anyway, as long as we do what the book says, you're pretty much guaranteed a happy ending. Uh, how about this one? ""Rescuing a damsel-pony-in-distress."" That's perfect! Of course, we'll have to improvise without a dragon."
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,apple bloom,Huh. Too bad Spike isn't here. Not that he's very threatening.
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,scootaloo,So what should we do? Wait around for Sugar Belle to get herself into a scary situation?
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,apple bloom,Or... we bring the danger to her.
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,apple bloom,"All right. Scootaloo's gonna pretend to take Sugar Belle's things, then you swoop in and stop her. Ready?"
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,big mcintosh,Nnope.
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,sweetie belle,"Come on! You're gonna be her hero! In fairy tales, the knight in shining armor always gets the girl."
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,big mcintosh,Hmmm... Mm-hmm.
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,sugar belle,"Oh! Somepony, help!"
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,sugar belle,"[sighs] Thank you, Feather!"
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,apple bloom,That smooth-talkin' pony stole our rescue! And it totally would've worked!
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,big mcintosh,[angry] Eeyup.
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,sweetie belle,"We're just gonna have to keep trying! Big Mac, are you ready to take it up a notch?"
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,big mcintosh,"Oh, yup!"
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,big mcintosh,"Oh, nope."
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,sweetie belle,"Trust us! There's nothing more romantic than waking your special pony from a sleeping spell with a magical kiss! See? ""They rode off into the sunset."""
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,apple bloom,Any sign of Feather Bangs?
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,scootaloo,Negative! Coast is clear!
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,apple bloom,"It's now or never, Big Mac!"
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,sweetie belle,Hey! That's our metaphorical sunset they're riding off into!
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,scootaloo,"All right! This ends now! Feather Bangs may have good timing, and... a good mane... uh, but let's see him compete with a song!"
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,big mcintosh,S-Say what now?
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,apple bloom,Of course! Why didn't we think of it before?
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,sweetie belle,"Every great love story hinges on the romantic musical number. Big Mac, you've gotta write a song for Sugar Belle!"
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,big mcintosh,Eeyup.
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,apple bloom,"Come on, Big Mac!"
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,apple bloom,Come on! You can do better than him! Just like we practiced!
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,big mcintosh,We'll take a walk down by the river Watch the sunset from the field We'll plant the seeds of love together And water 'em right for a really good yield
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,big mcintosh,"Sugar Belle, when I look in your eyes [clears throat] I see the color blue And it reminds me of the sky above Uh, which is also... blue"
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,big mcintosh,"I've been writin' this song for you Searchin' for the perfect rhyme For the words I wanna say Somethin', somethin', somethin', somethin'... Be mine"
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,big mcintosh,Sugar Belle! Roses are red and violets are blue!
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,big mcintosh,Sugar Belle!
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,big mcintosh,Sugar Belle!
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,big mcintosh,Sugar Belle!
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,sugar belle,"What in Equestria has gotten into you two?! If you think I'm the kind of pony that likes all this nonsense, then you clearly don't know me at all! I wish everypony would just... leave me alone!"
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,apple bloom,"Big Mac? Oh, Big Mac?!"
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,scootaloo,"Well, nopony's seen him."
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,apple bloom,"Aw, I feel terrible. I've never seen my brother so upset before. Oh, Big Mac?! Big Mac!"
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,sweetie belle,Are you okay?
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,big mcintosh,Nnope.
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,apple bloom,Sorry it didn't work out with Sugar Belle.
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,sweetie belle,"We don't get it. Big, grand gestures always work in the fairy tales."
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,big mcintosh,"But Sugar Belle's not a fairy tale princess. She's a real pony. She's kind, and she works hard, and she's sweeter than everything in her bakery."
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,apple bloom,That's it! We shoulda been thinking about what would mean a lot to Sugar Belle!
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,big mcintosh,Hmmm... [gasps] I know just the thing! But I'm gonna need your help!
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,apple bloom,Really? Even after we messed it up?
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,big mcintosh,Eeyup. Come on!
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,sugar belle,"Oh, okay. I'm... Wait a minute. You look familiar."
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,scootaloo,"[fake voice] I shouldn't. Um, uh, I'm new in town. Mind showing me around?"
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,sugar belle,"Uh, sure. That's the whole town. It's just the one street."
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,scootaloo,"[fake voice] Oh, no! Clumsy me! Here, let me help you clean it up!"
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,sweetie belle,I don't think Scootaloo can hold her off much longer.
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,scootaloo,"[fake voice] Uh, n-now hold on a minute. Are you sure I can't buy you a new bag?"
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,sugar belle,I'm good. It's no big deal.
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,sugar belle,"Okay, what's going on?"
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,scootaloo,[normal voice] Ahhh! The cupcake has landed! Repeat <U+0096> the cupcake has landed! Oof!
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,sugar belle,Big Mac! You made me a new display case?
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,big mcintosh,Eeyup.
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,sugar belle,"And you made it bigger! You remembered! [gasps] Now I have twice as much room for all my desserts! [gasps] Which means... I can make even more! I've been dying to try baking cream pies and whoopie pies and icebox cakes and, of course, more apple treats! Oh, Big Mac, thank you so much. This is the sweetest thing anypony's ever done for me."
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,big mcintosh,"[chuckles] Uh, y-y-yeah or-or nope or..."
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,sugar belle,"[giggles] I like you, too."
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,cutie mark crusaders,Awwwww!
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,apple bloom,That was the most romantic thing ever!
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,sugar belle,Wait a minute. I recognize you fillies. [to Big Mac] Have they been with you this whole time?
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,big mcintosh,Ee<U+0097>
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,apple bloom,"I'm Big Mac's little sister, and these are my friends. We're sorry for everything we put you through today, Sugar Belle. Big Mac never would've gone through with all of those crazy..."
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,sweetie belle,...over-the-top...
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,scootaloo,...downright ridiculous...
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,apple bloom,...attempts to impress you if we hadn't put him up to it. But we learned our lesson. Romance isn't about impressin' somepony. It's about doin' somethin' that means somethin' special to that pony you love<U+0097> Heh... [clears throat] like a lot.
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,sweetie belle,"Uh, Apple Bloom, I think they get it."
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,scootaloo,"Sorry, Feather. You're a little too late."
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,apple bloom,Yeah! Sugar Belle's already picked her special somepony!
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,sweetie belle,But don't worry. You've got three not-so-secret admirers right behind you!
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,apple bloom,"Uh, you're askin' us for advice?"
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,apple bloom,"Gee, I don't know about this."
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,scootaloo,"He just needs a little nudge in the conversation department. Besides, I don't think Big Mac's ready to leave just yet."
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,sweetie belle,Let's do it!
Hard to Say Anything,Becky Wangberg,apple bloom,"Feather Bangs, the Cutie Mark Crusaders are..."
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,rarity,No. [chuckling] It's a call for submissions. Fashion contest I'm organizing. A showcase for aspiring young designers.
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,pinkie pie,"Oh, wow! What an awesome idea!"
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,rarity,Thank you. I remember how difficult it was to break into the fashion industry when I was starting out. That's why the winner of the contest will get to debut their line in the Carousel Boutique!
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,spike,[dreamily] So selfless... So generous...
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,rarity,I've also managed to get esteemed fashion critic Hoity Toity and iconic fashion photographer Photo Finish to come to Ponyville and judge the show. And... [squealing] Wait until you hear who else will be a judge.
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,spike,Countess Coloratura?
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,pinkie pie,Sassy Saddles?
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,spike,Spike?!
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,rarity,No! [chuckling] The third judge for the Carousel Boutique's Couture du Future Fashion Contest is none other than... Applejack!
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,applejack,What?!
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,pinkie pie,What?!
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,spike,What?!
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,rarity,...What?
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,applejack,What?!
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,rarity,"You already said that, darling."
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,applejack,I know. But I had to say it again because that's how confused I am. You want me to judge a fashion show?
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,pinkie pie,"I'm sure Rarity has her reasons, and once we hear them, all of this will make sense."
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,rarity,"I admit, Applejack is an unorthodox choice. But that is precisely what makes her an inspired choice!"
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,pinkie pie,See? Now it all... still doesn't make any sense.
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,rarity,"Hoity Toity has expertise in fabric and stitchwork. Photo Finish has an artistic eye for shapes and colors. But sometimes, we designers forget about practicality. That's where you come in."
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,applejack,"Uh, I think I might be a little too practical. My closet's nothin' but twenty versions of this hat."
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,rarity,"Which tells me you're a pony who knows what she likes. Besides, a judge must be honest, and you're the most honest pony there is. Ask any pony <U+0096> they'll tell you."
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,pinkie pie,Ooh! Ooh! Lemme try! [to Cherry Fizzy] Excuse me. Have you ever heard of Applejack?
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,rarity,See? So what do you say?
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,applejack,"Well, if I'm bein' honest, I don't think I'm the right pony for the job. Fashion just ain't my bag of oats."
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,pinkie pie,"Aw, booooo!"
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,rarity,"I do understand your hesitation. But before you say no, sleep on it?"
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,applejack,"Sure, I... guess I can do that for ya."
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,applejack,"I mean, heh, can you imagine? Me, judgin' a fashion show?"
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,apple bloom,I'd do it! It sounds like fun gettin' to see all those pretty outfits!
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,applejack,"Although... Rarity did say I just had to focus on practicality. She already has experts for the... uh, fashion-y stuff. Eh, but I still wouldn't know what to say."
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,applejack,"Come on, Apple Bloom! You're doublin' our workload here!"
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,apple bloom,"Sorry. I wanted to wear a signature hat like yours, but it's makin' it harder to see."
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,apple bloom,"Wow! That is a lot better! Thanks, Applejack!"
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,applejack,"Sure thing. You know what? I am gonna help Rarity judge her show! I think my sensible ""everypony"" take on fashion is exactly what the pony community needs!"
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,applejack,"Rarity, I thought about it some more, and if you still need me, I'd love to be a judge."
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,rarity,[squeals] I just knew you'd come around!
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,photo finish,"I, Photo Finish, have arrived!"
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,hoity toity,As has Hoity Toity.
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,rarity,[gasps] It's wonderful to see you! Mwah! Mwah! Mwah!
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,photo finish,[simultaneously] Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,rarity,Thank you both so much for doing this. Mwah! Mwah! Mwah!
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,hoity toity,We missed you at Miss Pommel's debut in Manehattan last week.
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,rarity,Miss Pommel is showing? I thought she was still making costumes.
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,rarity,"Oh, my, they're absolutely stunning!"
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,applejack,It sure is great to hear Miss Pommel is doin' so well.
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,photo finish,Who is this?! Who speaks?!
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,rarity,"Oh, uh, this is Applejack. Another one of the judges."
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,hoity toity,"So, judge, what do you think?"
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,applejack,"Oh. Wow. Uh, that is just... wow. These are clothes?"
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,photo finish,Ze photo is upside-down!
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,applejack,This is... [scoffs] She looks like a disco ball! Hah! D-Did they have to roll her down the runway?! [laughing] I can't believe anypony would actually wear this! [laughing] Am I right?
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,hoity toity,"Oh, my!"
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,photo finish,I faint! Ugh...
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,rarity,[nervous chuckling] So funny... Ahem.
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,applejack,"Oh, gosh. I didn't mean to make her faint."
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,rarity,"Oh, don't worry about it, darling. Uh, it happens all the time. Besides, that dress did look a bit like a disco ball. Although, Miss Pommel is making the point that, no matter what we wear, it is a costume of some kind or another."
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,applejack,I have no idea what you're talkin' about.
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,rarity,And... that's okay. Let's go meet the designers and help them get ready for the show!
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,rarity,"Designers, welcome! Today you will work on your designs, and we judges will offer our guidance and advice as you prepare for tomorrow's big show."
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,rarity,"Lily Lace, tell us about your inspiration."
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,hoity toity,Powerful yet at the same time fragile and delicate.
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,applejack,Uh... Huh?
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,rarity,"Next up, meet Starstreak."
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,hoity toity,Mmmm... Tomorrow's fashion belongs to those who hear it coming.
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,photo finish,You have a very focused vision! A strong sense of what you want! It's gut!
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,rarity,"Applejack, you've been rather quiet. What do you think?"
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,applejack,Well... it's a lot of black. It's kinda... depressing.
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,hoity toity,Makes a world of difference!
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,applejack,"Maybe to fashion experts like you. But to ponies like me, it's still black."
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,applejack,And I'm not sure how you wear singin' birds or the future. [to Rarity] I don't think they liked what I had to say.
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,rarity,"Ah, well, that's why you're here. Fashion needs a healthy dose of practicality now and then."
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,applejack,Are you puttin' holes in the clothes?! On purpose?!
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,applejack,"More like an old and tattered look! When a pony's old clothes get holes in 'em, they don't wanna go to the store to buy new clothes with holes in 'em!"
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,rarity,"Okay, yes, not a very practical choice. Fashionable, but not practical."
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,photo finish,Simply shtunning!
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,applejack,"Sure, it looks pretty, but that's a lot of fabric. With the way it drags behind, it'll be covered in dirt in no time. Thank goodness I'm here. Otherwise, we'd have had holes in clothes and dirty dresses."
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,rarity,"But of course, no look is complete without mane and makeup!"
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,applejack,"So, uh... when are you gonna do her mane?"
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,rarity,"You know what? Uh, I think we've given the designers enough guidance for today. Let's, uh, let them finish their work."
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,applejack,"Uh, can't wait to see what y'all do for the big show tomorrow!"
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,pinkie pie,"Hey, Applejack! On your way home? How'd the first day of the contest go?"
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,applejack,"Heh! Great! At first, I didn't think I'd be much help. But thank goodness I signed on! Without me, they'd be doin' all kinds of crazy fashion-y things!"
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,pinkie pie,"Hey, Rarity! Applejack says the contest is going great! Good thing she's there, huh?"
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,rarity,"Yes, of course... Some of her thoughts are tough to swallow, but hopefully her candor will help the designers achieve the best designs possible."
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,rarity,Sure... Hmm.
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,rarity,[sighs] Much better.
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,rarity,"[inhale, exhale] I can meet my goals. Today is a fresh start. Good morning, everypony! Time for final adjustments before the show!"
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,hoity toity,"If buttons could convey sadness, you've done it."
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,applejack,"To me, they convey wakin' up an hour early just to button 'em all! And that's if you could reach most of 'em!"
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,applejack,"Heh. There you go! Now when it's cold, you just slide it on ya, and you're set. Like a poncho!"
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,hoity toity,Um... poncho?
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,hoity toity,Ohhhhh. You used hoof-cross-double-over stitches! [chuckles] They're perfect!
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,applejack,Who cares if it's stitched perfectly? You don't need feathers on your head!
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,photo finish,Gasp!
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,applejack,"My little sister tried to add some flair to her hat, and guess what it got her <U+0096> an extra hour of work pickin' apples off the ground!"
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,photo finish,"A good start, but it needs more. No. No. No. Yes!"
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,hoity toity,I'd go with this one.
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,photo finish,"No, this one!"
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,photo finish,Something is funny?
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,applejack,"What? Oh, no. Uh, it's just, I mean... Those belts look the same."
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,hoity toity,"Well, that one completely changes the look. This one complements it."
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,applejack,"You're kiddin', right?"
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,rarity,Is everything okay?
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,applejack,They're havin' a heated debate about those two belts.
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,rarity,Ooh! Both good choices.
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,applejack,No! There is no choice! They're the exact same belt! Ugh! This is so silly! Fashion is ridiculous!
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,rarity,You don't mean that!
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,applejack,"I do! I'm sorry, but that's my honest opinion!"
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,hoity toity,Well! I never would've come if I knew we were going to be insulted!
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,photo finish,We go!
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,rarity,No! Please! Come back!
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,applejack,What? I was just bein' honest!
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,rarity,Stop everything! There is no show! Take it all down!
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,pinkie pie,"Rarity, what's going on? Is everything okay?"
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,rarity,No! It is the opposite of okay! The judges have quit! The designers have dropped out! The show is cancelled! All my good intentions squashed! [sobbing] And it's all Applejack's fault!
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,applejack,Why are you mad at me?! I was just sayin' what I thought! And isn't that why you wanted me to be a judge?! For my honesty?!
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,rarity,Of course! But you said fashion is ridiculous!
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,applejack,But it's my opinion! And I'm not gonna lie!
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,rarity,Oh<U+0097>! [scoffs] Come with me!
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,rarity,"Hello, Strawberry Sunrise. This is Applejack. I was wondering if you could tell her how you feel about apples."
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,applejack,"What?! Why?! They're crunchy, they're sweet, they're delicious."
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,applejack,You're right! Apples are better than strawberries!
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,applejack,[stammering] You'd better apologize!
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,rarity,"Applejack, why are you so angry? It's just Strawberry's honest opinion. What's wrong with that?"
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,applejack,"Well, that's fine if she doesn't like 'em! But if she knew how hard we worked to make our apples perfect, maybe she wouldn't be so mean about<U+0097>! ...Ohhhhhhh... Oh, boy."
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,rarity,"Mm-hmm. Doesn't feel so good, does it?"
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,applejack,"Nope. No, it does not at all. [sighs] I am so sorry, Rarity. I got so carried away with bein' honest, I guess I didn't think about how I was makin' others feel. [sighs] I'm a real rotten apple."
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,rarity,"I appreciate that, Applejack. That means a lot. I just wish you'd realized it before you ruined the fashion show."
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,hoity toity,I need to get some of these.
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,photo finish,It's the only way to travel.
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,photo finish,What are you doing?!
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,hoity toity,Canterlot is that way.
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,applejack,Yup. But you're not goin' back to Canterlot yet.
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,applejack,Hey!
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,applejack,"Whew... Listen, y'all. I thought I was just bein' honest when I said all those things. But somepony helped me realize I was actually bein' hurtful. So for that, I apologize."
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,photo finish,Zo! You don't think fashion is ridiculous?!
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,applejack,"Uh... Well, I, uh... I still don't understand it. But I appreciate how much it means to y'all and how much hard work you put into it. I also know this contest is important to Rarity. So what do you say?"
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,hoity toity,"Well, I'd hate to have come all this way here and not see what you can do."
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,applejack,Anything.
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,applejack,"Show's back on, fellers!"
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,applejack,[grunting] Ahhh...
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,applejack,Aah!
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,pinkie pie,"...And then, Applejack found me and told me to distract you for an hour. But the hour's up! Ta-da!"
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,rarity,B-B-But how?! They were all leaving. This was all coming down.
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,applejack,I don't think that word means what you think it means. But I did bust my tail because I know how much this means to you.
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,rarity,"Ohhhhh! Thank you, Applejack."
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,photo finish,We start now!
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,rarity,"First up, Lily Lace!"
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,rarity,Starstreak!
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,rarity,Inky Rose!
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,rarity,"And now, it's time to vote. I am drawn to the beauty and drama of fashion, and nopony does drama better than Lily Lace, so I vote for her."
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,hoity toity,Simplicity is the keynote of true elegance. That is why I vote for Inky Rose.
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,photo finish,"Fashion is the art! I, Photo Finish, vote for Starstreak!"
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,rarity,"Well, it all comes down to you, Applejack."
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,pinkie pie,"Can you believe it?! After everything that's happened, Applejack is the deciding vote! [screams] This is so exciting! Eeeeee!"
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,rarity,"Well, Applejack?"
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,applejack,[sucks air through teeth] Uh... Heh. U-Uh... Uh...
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,rarity,"Lily Lace's clothes go here, Inky Rose's will go there, and Starstreak's there."
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,applejack,"Sorry, but I couldn't pick just one. They all did great, and in my opinion, they all deserve to win."
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,rarity,And I agree. I told you your perspective would be beneficial.
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,applejack,"Is, uh, this one of your new designs, Rarity? It's, uh... Uh, the form is... reminiscent of, uh... I mean, it conjures up images of... uh... well, uh... I-I mean..."
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,rarity,"Oh, that? No! I totally messed that one up! It's ghastly! Horrid! Absolutely terrible!"
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,applejack,"Hah. Oh, thank goodness. 'Cause in my honest opinion... it's awful."
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,rarity,Pffft!
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,rarity,"When you're right, you're right!"
Honest Apple,Kevin Lappin,applejack,I am relieved!
A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,starlight glimmer,I know! I can't believe it either! The map has never called me before!
A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,spike,I'm sure that's not why she looks... like that.
A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,starlight glimmer,"I also wasn't nervous before, but now..."
A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,"Don't worry. For all we know, it's something small. Like maybe the cooks are fighting over who has the best butternut squash soup. Or the royal hairdressers are fighting over a comb."
A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,spike,"Or, you know, maybe the royal sisters aren't seeing eye-to-eye on something."
A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,No! That's just crazy! Luna and Celestia would never fight. [beat] Again.
A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,princess celestia,So the map sent you to solve a friendship problem?
A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,starlight glimmer,"Yes, princess."
A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,princess celestia,"Well, there's nothing wrong here. Right, sister?"
A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,princess luna,"[sourly] No. Everything's perfect as usual, sister."
A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,Psst! Pssst!
A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,starlight glimmer,Twilight? Is that you? How are you here?
A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,"[quickly] I'm not. I'm still home. It's an easy spell. I'll show you later. Anyway, enough about me. I had to check on you. Not in a meddling kind of way! In a friendly ""how's it going?"" kind of way. So, how's it going?"
A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,starlight glimmer,[sighs] Not great. I think the problem might be between Celestia and Luna.
A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,"Oh, no, that's terrible! I mean, what makes you say that?"
A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,starlight glimmer,You know how some ponies say nothing's wrong but you can tell something's definitely wrong?
A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,[nervously] Noooooo... Heh.
A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,starlight glimmer,"That's basically what the princesses did when I said there was a friendship problem. Only they did it more, you know, regally."
A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,"Oh, I wish I could help you, but I can't <U+0096> both for map reasons and because I have no idea! This is big! Like, really big! But I'm here if you ever need to talk. Or listen to music."
A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,"Heh. Comforting, right?"
A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,starlight glimmer,"Thank you so much for breakfast, princess. I can't believe you cook it yourself."
A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,princess celestia,"Of course, Starlight! I really enjoy doing it. It's a small way to say I care."
A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,princess celestia,"Good morning, sister! Join us?"
A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,princess luna,[sourly] Too tired. [chomp] Please excuse me.
A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,starlight glimmer,Wow. Last night must've been really hard on her.
A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,princess celestia,[sighs] Perhaps. But she is like this every morning.
A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,starlight glimmer,So I think Luna may be hurting her sister's feelings without even realizing it.
A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,Poor Celestia. That's so sweet that she makes her sister pancakes every morning.
A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,starlight glimmer,She's your mentor. I think you might be biased.
A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,Fair enough. So what are you gonna do?
A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,starlight glimmer,"Nothing, yet. I have to get all the facts. I asked Luna if I could spend some time with her this evening."
A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,"Good luck, Starlight!"
A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,starlight glimmer,"Wow, Princess Luna. You do this every night?"
A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,princess luna,Lavender's calming scent is known to aid dreamers in achieving a restorative sleep.
A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,starlight glimmer,[sniffs] That's so thoughtful!
A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,princess luna,I try my best to make sure the ponies in this castle sleep peacefully.
A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,princess celestia,"[laughs] Oh, you really are a card!"
A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,princess luna,"[sighs] But as always, my sister is too busy having fun with dignitary ponies to acknowledge anything I do. Hmph!"
A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,starlight glimmer,"So, both princesses are hurting each other without realizing it. And instead of talking about it, they're just getting colder and more distant."
A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,And they're Celestia and Luna. So it's not like you can just confront them.
A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,starlight glimmer,"Actually, that's exactly what I was gonna do."
A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,"What?! Are you crazy?! I mean, heh, you do whatever you think is best. This is your mission."
A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,starlight glimmer,"[sarcastically] Gee, thanks for believing in me, Twilight."
A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,"I do. But the last time the princesses fought, Luna turned into Nightmare Moon, and Princess Celestia had to banish her for a thousand years! That can't happen again!"
A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,starlight glimmer,"Well, I can't do nothing. The princesses aren't the best at communicating with each other."
A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,"[gasps] Sorry. It's just, you said ""princesses"" and ""aren't the best"" in the same sentence, and it's making me nervous!"
A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,"I'm not much help, am I?"
A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,starlight glimmer,No!
A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,starlight glimmer,Wow. I almost feel bad eating this. It's adorable.
A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,princess celestia,"Like I said, I enjoy this part."
A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,princess luna,"[sourly, mouth full] Hi."
A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,starlight glimmer,"Uh, Princess Luna! Wait! [deep breath] As you both know, the map sent me here for a reason, and I... think I found out what it is."
A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,princess celestia,"Really? Oh, that is wonderful, Starlight! What is it?"
A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,starlight glimmer,You two.
A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,princess celestia,Excuse me?
A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,princess luna,[simultaneous] I beg your pardon?
A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,starlight glimmer,"I think you're accidentally hurting each other's feelings without realizing it. Princess Celestia, does it bother you that Luna never notices the wonderful breakfasts that you prepare for her?"
A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,princess celestia,Uh... Y-Yes. It does.
A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,starlight glimmer,"Princess Luna, tell Celestia how you feel about the fact that she never acknowledges the work you put into lining the hallway with lavender every night."
A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,princess luna,"I... Well, I... I-It's not the best feeling. [to Celestia] I'm sorry I never noticed that you make fruit faces on pancakes, but nights are long for me. You might be a morning pony, but I am half-asleep."
A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,princess celestia,"You think I don't get tired? I'm exhausted! Oh, I apologize for not noticing flowers in a wall sconce. But by the time I get to retire for the night, I can barely see straight! Even so, I still make an effort to smile!"
A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,princess luna,Like smiling is so hard.
A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,starlight glimmer,I-I-I'm sure that's not what Princess Luna meant to say.
A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,princess luna,Is that what exhausts you? Smiling and being adored by everypony?
A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,princess celestia,"And you have it so much worse, do you?! You've spent your evenings flitting around giving ponies lovely dreams! Oh, it sounds just awful!"
A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,starlight glimmer,"[chuckles] Okay! I feel like we should step back, take a deep breath..."
A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,princess luna,Don't presume to know what it is like to govern the dream realm!
A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,princess celestia,"And yet you know exactly what it's like to be me?! Oh, please!"
A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,starlight glimmer,Enough!
A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,princess celestia,[gasps] What have you done?!
A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,starlight glimmer,I... went with my gut?
A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,princess luna,Switch our cutie marks back this instant!
A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,starlight glimmer,"My apologies, your majesties! But I can't, even if I wanted to. The spell lasts twenty-four hours. I-It may have been extreme, but, uh, I think it's still a good idea?"
A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,princess celestia,[serious] What?
A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,starlight glimmer,Y-You said it yourselves! Neither of you believes your sister knows how hard it is to be you. So this is your chance to prove it.
A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,princess luna,"Well, I could use an easy day followed by a good night's sleep."
A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,princess celestia,"You can try. I haven't had an easy day in, well, ever! But now, I get to sleep, and tonight will be a breeze. All right, Starlight Glimmer. We will do this."
A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,starlight glimmer,I'm gonna stop talking now.
A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,[hyperventilating] You switched their cutie marks?! The actual princesses' cutie marks?!
A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,starlight glimmer,[groans] I thought we moved past this. It was the right call! I hope.
A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,starlight glimmer,"I-I'm good! Just, uh... reading an exciting book! [whispering to Twilight] He's gonna think I'm nuts!"
A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,He's not the only one.
A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,princess luna,"As you can see, Celestia and I are switching places today."
A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,princess luna,"I assure you, I am more than capable of handling all of Celestia's, heh, duties. Dismissed."
A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,princess luna,"So, what is first on my dear sister's to-do list?"
A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,starlight glimmer,"It says you have a few public appearances. Store openings, judging the royal rose contest... You know, that sort of thing."
A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,princess luna,"[chuckles] Oh, I knew today would be easy, but I didn't think it would be that easy."
A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,princess luna,"""Princess Luna Unhappy with Student Fundraiser""? But I wasn't unhappy!"
A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,starlight glimmer,"Um, you are scowling."
A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,princess luna,"Well, I-I didn't mean to! I've been smiling all day! My cheeks hurt! I stopped for one second! And that's when he took the picture!"
A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,starlight glimmer,Guess smiling all day isn't as easy as you thought?
A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,princess luna,"It says here that, because of me, the school didn't raise enough funds to go on their field trip! I-I didn't mean for that to happen!"
A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,starlight glimmer,"I know. But you can't dwell on that now. According to the list, some delegates are about to arrive for a luncheon. You need to dispel rumors of timberwolves in the White Tail Woods. The nearby towns have been in a state of panic for weeks."
A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,princess luna,B-B-But I have to fix this!
A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,starlight glimmer,You can't. You need to put on a brave face and help these ponies. It's what Celestia would do.
A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,princess luna,"[deep breath, shouting] Hello! Great news! There are no timberwolves!"
A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,princess luna,"I'm sorry. But I couldn't stop thinking about those poor students. Normally, I have all the time in solitude I need to work through my problems at my own pace."
A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,starlight glimmer,"Well, your sister doesn't get that luxury."
A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,starlight glimmer,Ready for the town hall?
A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,starlight glimmer,You made it to the end of the day. Yay?
A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,princess celestia,"Oh, hello, Starlight. I don't know about you, but I feel very well-rested. Where's Luna?"
A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,starlight glimmer,"Um, uh, she already turned in for the night."
A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,princess celestia,Did she now? It seems my duties were harder than my sister expected.
A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,princess celestia,Moon raised! It's even easier than raising the sun. [chuckles] What's next?
A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,princess celestia,"All right. Everypony's asleep. You're talking to yourself, Celestia. Heh. But there's nopony else to talk to! [chuckles] Yet. I can talk to ponies in their dreams!"
A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,princess celestia,"Now, to save some ponies from their nightmares. Which aren't real, so it shouldn't be too hard, right? Right. Good call, Celestia! And I'm talking to myself again."
A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,starlight glimmer,[screaming] Ugh! No!
A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,"This is big! Like, really big!"
A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,princess celestia,Starlight! I'm here now. Tell me what's wrong.
A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,starlight glimmer,"[panting] Going with my gut was the wrong call! I was supposed to bring you two closer together! But I've only driven you apart! If you two can't see why you need each other, then<U+0097>!"
A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,princess celestia,"Don't worry, Starlight. I know how to handle Nightmare Moon."
A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,princess celestia,This can't be!
A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,princess celestia,No! I'll never turn into you!
A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,princess celestia,"That's not true! Even when we were apart, I knew I needed her!"
A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,starlight glimmer,"No, you can't do that! Day, night, sun, moon <U+0097> Equestria needs both of you!"
A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,starlight glimmer,"Without balance, there's no harmony!"
A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,nightmare moon,"You can't get rid of me so easily, sister! Unless you plan on smiling me to smithereens!"
A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,princess celestia,Enough!
A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,starlight glimmer,This is all my fault! I never should've gone on this mission! Now Equestria is doomed!
A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,princess luna,[through teeth gaps] I don't...!
A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,princess luna,"I mean, I do!"
A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,princess luna,Celestia! I'm so glad you're...!
A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,princess luna,"[speaking normally] I've seen a lot, but I haven't seen this before."
A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,princess celestia,It's Starlight Glimmer's. She's afraid this is what will happen if we continue to fight!
A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,starlight glimmer,[sobbing] What was I thinking?! I'm never going with my gut again!
A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,princess luna,"If you don't fix this soon, it could have a grave consequence on Starlight's psyche."
A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,princess celestia,But my magic isn't powerful enough! I thought if we worked together...!
A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,princess luna,"I have your magic, remember? It doesn't work in the dream realm. It has to be you!"
A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,princess celestia,"Oh, Luna, I can't do this! I was wrong! Your job is so incredibly hard! You have to battle nightmares and work in the darkness and do it all alone! It takes such a brave, strong pony to do what you do!"
A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,princess luna,"And that pony is you. I walked a day in your shoes. I thought all you had to do was smile and be adored all the time, but I was wrong. There is so much more to it than that."
A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,nightmare moon,[screams] Ugh!
A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,starlight glimmer,Don't do this to each other!
A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,princess luna,"In order to defeat Daybreaker, you need only to trust in your strength as I do."
A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,princess celestia,"No, you're not! You are not real, and you will never exist again!"
A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,princess luna,You did it!
A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,princess celestia,Only because you were here. I don't know how you do this alone.
A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,princess luna,"So, um, did you talk to yourself?"
A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,princess celestia,"Um, a little."
A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,starlight glimmer,"Is this really happening, or is this still a dream?"
A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,princess luna,"Welcome back, sister! I know you had a long night, so I made you some pancakes!"
A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,princess celestia,"Oh! Heh. H-How... eh, nice. Ahem. [chews, gags, gulps] They're... delicious. Heh. Thank you."
A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,princess luna,"[laughs] I know that face! They're not. I know you have to be perfect for everypony else, and you do an amazing job. But you don't have to do it for me."
A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,princess celestia,"In that case, they are terrible!"
A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,princess luna,I know!
A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,princess celestia,"[sighs] But it means a lot that you tried. I love you, sister."
A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,princess luna,I love you too.
A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,starlight glimmer,"So... this was real. [yawns] Or... was it not real, and this just happened now and-and not in my dream? I'm so confused."
A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,princess celestia,[laughing] It's all real. It was the right call going with your gut.
A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,princess luna,"The map was wise to send you, Starlight. Nopony else would have been so bold as to do what you did."
A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,starlight glimmer,That's a nice way of saying I came dangerously close to messing everything up.
A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,princess celestia,It was just what we needed. The experience has made us closer than ever.
A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,starlight glimmer,Wait. I'm not doing this.
A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,princess celestia,I believe that one means your mission is complete.
A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,starlight glimmer,Wow! I can't wait to tell Twilight!
A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,twilight sparkle,"[quickly] I already know! I mean, I don't know everything. I just got here to bring you your toothbrush! So this is just a friendly visit! Not interfering because I was worried! I wasn't! I knew you could do it, and I'm so, so, so, so, so proud of you! Tell me everything! Start from after I hyperventilated, and don't leave out any details!"
A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,princess luna,"Oh, uh, by the way, there's a field trip you need to make happen and a <U+0096> ahem <U+0096> timberwolf issue you need to address."
A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,princess celestia,W-What?
A Royal Problem,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,princess luna,Oh! Look! There's the sun! Time for me to turn in!
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,pinkie pie,"Oh, wow! Oh, my gosh!"
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,pinkie pie,"Oh-my-gosh-oh-my-gosh-oh-my-gosh-oh-my-gosh! Oh-my-gosh-oh-my-gosh-oh-my-gosh! Sorry, Applejack!"
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,pinkie pie,Twilight! Twilight! Where are you?!
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,twilight sparkle,"I'm in here, Pinkie! What is it?"
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,pinkie pie,You'll never guess what I just got!
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,applejack,"Is everythin' okay? We heard a lot of ""oh-my-gosh""-in', and we weren't sure if it was a good thing or a bad thing."
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,pinkie pie,A good thing!
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,twilight sparkle,"[reading] ""To pink pony who lives with baked goods."" It's from the yaks! [reading] ""Yaks cordially invite pink pony to Yickslurbertfest. Come. Now."""
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,pinkie pie,Prince Rutherford is officially inviting me to Yickslurbertfest in Yakyakistan!
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,rarity,What is Yickslurbertfest?
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,twilight sparkle,It's a sacred yak holiday. How did you get Prince Rutherford to invite you?
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,pinkie pie,I subtly hinted for an invitation in my letters to him.
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,pinkie pie,[voiceover] May I please come to Yickslurbertfest? Pretty please? Pretty please? Pretty please? Pretty-pretty-pretty-pretty-pretty please?!
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,twilight sparkle,"You know, we still don't know a lot about the yaks. So I think you should definitely go to Yickslurbertfest, Pinkie."
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,fluttershy,Fostering friendships is what ponies do.
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,pinkie pie,I won't let you down! It's an honor to be the official friendship ambassador to the yaks!
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,twilight sparkle,"Um, that's not an official position."
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,pinkie pie,Yet. You're the princess of friendship. [singsongy] You can make it happen.
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,twilight sparkle,"Okay, you got it."
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,pinkie pie,Ahem? You have to make it official!
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,twilight sparkle,[sighs] Right. I hereby make Pinkie Pie the official friendship ambassador to the yaks!
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,pinkie pie,This is officially the most exciting day of my life!
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,pinkie pie,Yoo-hoo! Gummy! Pay attention! We're in the middle of an official friendship ambassador road trip game!
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,pinkie pie,That's better. Okay. I spy with my official friendship eye something that is blue!
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,pinkie pie,"[gasps] We're here! Oh, and by the way, the answer was sky. I win!"
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,pinkie pie,"Yeah, I know. That was a hard one, Gummy. You're the best official friendship travel companion ever!"
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,pinkie pie,What is going on?
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,prince rutherford,Yaks destroy!
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,pinkie pie,Yikes!
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,prince rutherford,[laughs] Pink pony!
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,pinkie pie,"It's an honor to [grunts] be here, prince. Uh, did something terrible happen? Is Yickslurbertfest cancelled?!"
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,prince rutherford,"No! This Yickslurbertfest, where yaks come together to stomp."
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,pinkie pie,Ohhhhh. I didn't know that was part of the sacred holiday. So this angry display of destruction is part of the festivies. Huh. And here I thought you yaks were just in a bad mood.
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,prince rutherford,No. Stomping relaxes yaks. [grunting] Yaks' head never been so clear.
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,prince rutherford,Stop!
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,prince rutherford,"Pink pony better check self before wreck self. That is century-old sacred yak twig, passed down from generation to generation."
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,pinkie pie,"[gasps] Oh, no! I'm so sorry! I was just trying to get into the spirit of Yickslurbertfest. [distressed noises] Maybe I can fix it!"
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,pinkie pie,"Phew! Oh, you sure did, Prince Rutherford. [chuckles, to Gummy] That was a close one, Gummy! This trip has to be perfect! After all, we're not just visiting as friends. We're on official friendship ambassador business!"
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,prince rutherford,"Less talking, more stomping!"
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,pinkie pie,Stompie-stompie-stompie-stompie!
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,prince rutherford,"Now, I take pink pony on Yakyakistan tour."
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,pinkie pie,"Thanks, Prince Rutherford, but, heh, I've been to Yakyakistan before."
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,prince rutherford,Yak know. But thought pink pony might not recognize town since decorated for Yickslurbertfest.
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,prince rutherford,"Oh, yaks not just have eye for decorating. Yaks also amazing builders!"
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,pinkie pie,[gasps] No way! I thought you hired professional contractors!
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,pinkie pie,"Here. Uh, let me help you with that."
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,prince rutherford,"This ceremonial yak fire pit, where yaks tell stories."
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,pinkie pie,Oooh! I have so much to officially tell the ponies when I get back.
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,prince rutherford,This yak eating hut. Hut where yaks eat.
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,pinkie pie,"[slurp, chomp, gulp] Mmmm! The perfect balance of vanilla extract."
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,prince rutherford,Yak sleeping hut. Hut where yaks sleep.
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,pinkie pie,Huh!
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,prince rutherford,Yak music hut. Hut where yaks enjoy beautiful music.
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,pinkie pie,This is beautiful and<U+0097>!
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,prince rutherford,Shhh! Pink pony ruin with talking!
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,prince rutherford,...And that how yaks defeat evil and save world!
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,pinkie pie,"[claps, in deep voice] Pink pony like yak story!"
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,prince rutherford,Ho-ho! Yak impressed! Pink pony can almost be honorary yak.
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,pinkie pie,"[speaking normally] Official friendship ambassador and honorary yak?! [squeals] Pink pony's title card is full! [in deep voice] Horn bump! [speaking normally] Oh, wait! I don't have a horn! [gasps] Prince Rutherford, can I get some honorary yak horns?"
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,prince rutherford,No. Yak horn too heavy for small pony head.
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,prince rutherford,Yickslurbertfest stomp time!
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,prince rutherford,Stomp harder! Yaks extra happy! Ponies and yaks friends!
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,pinkie pie,Is this part of the festival?
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,prince rutherford,Pink pony ask too many questions.
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,pinkie pie,Everything is buried in snow! What are we gonna do?!
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,prince rutherford,Uhhh... Y-Yaks fine! Snow falls from mountain all the time!
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,pinkie pie,All the time?
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,prince rutherford,Every Yickslurbertfest.
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,pinkie pie,Okay. Avalanches like this completely bury all your homes every Yickslurbertfest? Really?
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,prince rutherford,"This is... big avalanche. But not a problem, for yaks are tough! Yaks dig through snow! Won't take long."
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,pinkie pie,"Oh, good. You have an emergency plan in place."
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,pinkie pie,"Here, let me help!"
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,pinkie pie,Whew. I'm tired. We must be almost done. There's still snow everywhere?!
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,prince rutherford,Yaks keep digging!
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,prince rutherford,Yaks stop digging! Make situation worse!
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,pinkie pie,"Okay. Don't worry, Prince Rutherford. I'll go back to Ponyville and ask for help. Twilight and the others will be happy to come dig the snow away. After all, ""many hooves make light work."" Right, Gummy?"
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,prince rutherford,Yaks no need pony help!
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,pinkie pie,"Oh. Well, I'm sure it'll be okay, 'cause you probably have a Plan B."
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,prince rutherford,Yes. Yaks wait for snow to melt.
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,pinkie pie,All this snow?! It'll take a thousand moons before it melts!
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,prince rutherford,Yaks known for their patience.
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,pinkie pie,"Well... be that as it may, in the meantime, what will you eat? Where will you sleep?"
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,prince rutherford,"Dah! Yaks can make this work! Hardship make yaks the strong yaks that yaks are! If pink pony disagrees, then she can leave Yakyakistan and never return!"
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,pinkie pie,"[yelps] Uh, of course pink pony agrees with you! [nervous chuckle] Hey, let's try out some snow recipes! [grunting] Snow cakes! Snow spaghetti! Snow sandwiches! [nervous chuckle, chomp] Mmmm! Yaks can make this work!"
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,prince rutherford,[yawns] Yak tired. Yak retire to new sleeping hut.
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,prince rutherford,[gulps] Snow cake good!
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,pinkie pie,"[chomp, gulp, shiver] Mmmm! Just the right balance of cold and water!"
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,prince rutherford,Aah! Stop! Yak eating new eating hut!
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,pinkie pie,[whispering] Psst! Prince Rutherford. What are we doing?
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,prince rutherford,It's obvious. This new music hut.
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,pinkie pie,Oh. So we're swaying to<U+0097>
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,prince rutherford,Shhh! Pink pony ruin snow music with talking!
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,pinkie pie,"[gasps] Gummy, did you hear that? They can't make it work!"
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,prince rutherford,Yaks stop swaying! Music over!
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,pinkie pie,"If Twilight and the others knew what was going on, they would be here to help in a pony's heartbeat. We have to convince Prince Rutherford that asking for help is okay. Will you help me, Gummy?"
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,pinkie pie,Thank you! And see? Asking you to help wasn't hard at all.
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,pinkie pie,"Pink pony has gathered you around the new ceremonial yak fire pit to tell you a story! A yak tradition, right?"
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,pinkie pie,"Yay! This is a story about a group of... uh, goats!"
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,pinkie pie,"[voiceover] Who lived in the desert. There was a sandstorm, and their entire village was buried in sand. There was nothing they could do. They knew they could not survive by only eating sand...wiches!"
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,pinkie pie,[giggles] Get it?
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,pinkie pie,...Okay. Anyway...
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,pinkie pie,"[voiceover] Finally, the goats' brave, wise leader <U+0096> let's just call him Prince... uh... Drutherford [giggles] <U+0096> decides that they couldn't do it by themselves. So he asked the neighboring town of, uh, Bovineville to come help them. [giggles] Yeah! Cows! The magical cows helped the goats, everyone survived, and lived happily ever after!"
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,pinkie pie,Because they asked for help. The end!
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,pinkie pie,So what is the moral of that story? Is it <U+0096> A <U+0096> asking for help is okay? B <U+0096> asking for help saves the day? Or <U+0096> C <U+0096> asking for help is good for everypony?
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,prince rutherford,D <U+0096> goats weak and horrible! Magic bovines need to stay out of goats' business!
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,pinkie pie,Um... [nervous chuckle] Not quite. Any yak wanna shout out another answer?
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,pinkie pie,"Hey, Prince Rutherford. I wanna talk to you about something. Uh, what are you doing?"
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,prince rutherford,"Uh, yak's snow bed got a little melty last night."
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,pinkie pie,"Okay, yeah. That's what I wanna talk to you about. You know, these yak snow beds are the fluffiest I've ever slept in. They're so comfortable, you forget that it's just a cold block of ice. And the yak snow sandwiches? Mm-mmm! I hate it when food burns your mouth or overwhelms it with flavor!"
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,prince rutherford,"Ah! Yak hates that, too!"
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,pinkie pie,"You know who would really, really enjoy these snow sandwiches? Twilight Sparkle and the other ponies! Oh, hey! I have an idea! Why don't I go to Ponyville and bring them back here?"
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,prince rutherford,Ponies like snow sandwich?
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,pinkie pie,"Oh! Ponies love snow sandwiches! And hey, while they're here, you can ask if they'll clear the snow away. Fun, right?"
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,prince rutherford,"When prince was little yak, prince stomped on ground too hard. Made deep hole and fell into hole. Ice froze over hole. Prince waved to friends and family from inside frozen hole. Waited for spring thaw. Prince survived on own."
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,pinkie pie,W-W-Wait a minute. You spent the whole winter in a hole?
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,prince rutherford,Yes. And yak never asked for help!
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,pinkie pie,"Okay. First of all, how did you make such a deep hole from stomping? And how did it freeze over so fast? And how could you see your family and friends to wave to them from inside a frozen hole? Even if all that was possible, how did you breathe in there?!"
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,prince rutherford,Yaks don't ask for help!
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,pinkie pie,But the yaks are hungry! And who knows when the snow will melt? I just don't understand why<U+0097>
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,prince rutherford,"Ah, yes. Is clear now that pink pony does not understand yaks. Honorary yak status rescinded! Bang! Pretend there is door! I just slammed it!"
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,pinkie pie,Fine! Be stubborn!
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,pinkie pie,"[groans] Those yaks are so stubborn! They refuse to ask for help, even though they need it! Well, this official friendship ambassador is gonna take matters into her own hooves! I'll show them!"
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,pinkie pie,"[sighs] You're right, Gummy. I am too worked up. Road trip game would officially calm me down. I know! Let's play Twenty Million Questions! You think of something, then I'll ask you twenty million questions until I can come up with what you're thinking of! Let's go! Is it blue? Is it green? Is it red? Is it greenish-red? Is it reddish-blue? Is it bigger than a bread box? Is it smaller than a bread box? Is it a bread box? Is it bread?"
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,pinkie pie,"...Is it teeth? Is it Granny Smith's dentures? Is it you? Is it a rooster? Is it a red rooster? Is it a red rooster eating corn? Ah! Used up all twenty million questions! Oh, well. We're here anyway."
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,prince rutherford,Official pony balloon still here? Pink pony gone because pink pony not tough like yaks! Horn bump in agreement! Now!
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,prince rutherford,"[chomp, chewing] Pleh! Snow sandwich lose novelty! Snow couscous for dinner!"
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,pinkie pie,"Then Prince Rutherford said, [imitating Prince Rutherford] ""Bang! Pretend there is door! I just slammed it!"""
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,twilight sparkle,Pinkie Pie<U+0097>
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,pinkie pie,"So then pink pony said, [high-pitched] ""Fine! Be stubborn!"""
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,twilight sparkle,"Pinkie Pie, we have to help the yaks."
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,pinkie pie,"So in conclusion, we have to help the yaks!"
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,twilight sparkle,Hmm?
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,applejack,"Just go with it, hon."
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,twilight sparkle,"Great idea, Pinkie. We'll be happy to help the yaks. This is what friendship is all about."
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,applejack,Hey! I'll bring apples. This season's batch are extra juicy.
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,rarity,And I shall provide the yaks with Equestria's finest textiles. They'll be silky and warm with hints of gold to complement their horns<U+0097>
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,pinkie pie,Stop! We can't bring the yaks any pony stuff!
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,fluttershy,Why not?
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,pinkie pie,"The yaks are very proud. They won't ask for help. You know what they say <U+0096> ""you can lead a yak to water, but you better not let him know you're doing it."""
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,rainbow dash,Nopony says that. Do they?
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,twilight sparkle,Okay then. This'll be an official covert friendship mission.
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,rainbow dash,You got it!
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,pinkie pie,Is it yellow? Is it slimy? Is it slimy yellow?
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,rainbow dash,We're not playing that!
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,pinkie pie,These walls are high. Sneaking in will not be easy.
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,rainbow dash,Or it's super-easy 'cause I'm awesome.
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,pinkie pie,Go ahead! I'll catch up! You all know what to do!
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,prince rutherford,"[yawns, gasps] What happened?!"
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,prince rutherford,[laughs] Yaks tough! Yaks wait patiently! Yaks win!
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,applejack,Hoo-wee! Helpin' to fix an entire yak village sure takes a lot outta ya.
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,twilight sparkle,Let's get out of here before<U+0097>
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,prince rutherford,"Oh, pink pony!"
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,pinkie pie,"[nervous gasping] Just play it cool! [to Prince Rutherford] We didn't help fix Yakyakistan! [nervous chuckle] No, no! We're just here for the snow sandwiches! But then we got here, and the snow was gone, so we thought we'd hit a diner on our way back to Ponyville! Bye-bye!"
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,prince rutherford,Wait. Yak not mad at pink pony.
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,pinkie pie,Yak not?
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,prince rutherford,Pink pony help yaks without yaks asking. Means pink pony understand yaks.
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,pinkie pie,I do? Huh! I do!
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,prince rutherford,Pink pony the best kind of friend. Officially honorary yak!
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,pinkie pie,Yippee! My own honorary yak horns! Now I can officially horn-bump! Whoa!
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,pinkie pie,"Yeah... You know, this is a little heavy for my small pony head."
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,applejack,"[chuckles] Need some help with that, Pinkie Pie?"
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,pinkie pie,"[deep voice] Pink pony no need apple pony's help! [giggling and snorting, normally] Just kidding! Pink pony got apple pony good!"
Not Asking for Trouble,May Chan,pinkie pie,"Seriously, this is heavy."
Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,fluttershy,Care for a carrot-ginger sandwich?
Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,discord,Oh! You remembered to cut off the crusts for me.
Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,fluttershy,Of course I did. I know how you like them.
Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,discord,You really do make the best finger foods.
Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,discord,What do you say?
Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,discord,[scoffs] I really can't take them anywhere.
Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,discord,Can I trouble you for another sugarcube?
Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,fluttershy,"Oh, no. I'm so sorry, but I seem to be out."
Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,discord,"Well, I can just pop us in some more."
Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,fluttershy,"Oh, that's all right. I need to go to the market anyway. I have to restock my pantry for our tea party next week."
Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,discord,Oh. I never realized how much work you put into hosting these tea parties.
Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,fluttershy,"Oh, it's really not that much."
Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,discord,"No, no, no, no, no! I've been taking advantage of your hospitality for far too long. It's high time I do something about it. What to do, what to do..."
Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,discord,I've got it! Why don't I host the next tea party at my place?
Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,fluttershy,Are you sure? I wouldn't want you to go through any trouble.
Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,fluttershy,Then count me in. I'm already looking forward to it.
Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,discord,"Me, too! I'm so excited! I can't wait! No, really, I can't! How about we have the tea party tomorrow afternoon?"
Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,fluttershy,"Sounds good to me. You know, Discord, I've never been to your house before."
Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,discord,"Well, that's okay, because I've never hosted a tea party before."
Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,discord,"Oh! I've never hosted a tea party before! So much to do! [sips tea] Thank you so much for the tea and nibblies, but I really must be going!"
Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,fluttershy,"Uh, Discord? Before you go, would you mind helping me tidy up?"
Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,discord,"There you go. Back to normal, just the way you like it. See you tomorrow!"
Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,discord,I can't wait!
Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,discord,"Okay. Since Fluttershy always goes out of her way to host the perfect tea party for me, how do I make my tea party for her even more perfect?"
Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,discord,"Actually, madam, I'm talking to myself."
Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,discord,It's for Fluttershy!
Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,discord,You don't have to tell me that. She gave us a chance when no other pony would.
Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,discord,Of course! I should get her the best of everything. Why didn't I think of that? ...Well? Are you going to answer me or not?
Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,discord,Excuse me. Is this where Fluttershy usually buys her tea?
Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,discord,"Oh, wonderful! I'll be enjoying her company tomorrow, so I will be needing your very best tea, please. Something especially special."
Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,discord,"[chuckling] Oh, interesting. Does it decorate your hips in roses or turn you green?"
Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,discord,How boring. Pass. Hold on! Ginseng tea! Now that sounds promising. What does it sing? I'm partial to something upbeat and jazzy.
Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,discord,So... all of this is just tea you simply drink?
Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,discord,[laughs] Singing ginseng! I'll take it!
Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,discord,"Well, of course we're friends! She gets me, and you obviously do not! [imitating ""Jasmine Leaf""] ""Are you sure you're friends with Fluttershy?"" [scoffs] The very nerve!"
Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,discord,I'm sorry. Do you validate?
Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,discord,Hello!
Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,discord,"Yes, you can. Your finest tea set, please. I want only the best for my friend Fluttershy."
Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,discord,"Yes... judgy... clerk... pony! Why is it such a surprise? Sure, she's on the quieter side, and I'm a bit, well, more showy. But I'll have you know we're besties. And that's why I need the [echoing] best tea set!"
Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,discord,A teapot that just pours tea? How positively dreadful!
Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,discord,"Now, let's see. I have the perfect tea and the perfect tea service. What else do I need for the perfect tea party? Oh! Decorations, of course!"
Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,discord,"[chuckles] Better. Oh! I'll need napkins. I'll simply make them... ah, well, I could... or... No. I've got nothing. How do I make these better? What should I do? Make them... [gasps, snaps fingers] Make them glow! Oh, that's not good enough for Fluttershy. Should I make them fly? Glow, fly, and [chuckles] and fold! Glow, fly, fold into fun shapes, perhaps?"
Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,pinkie pie,"Uh, Discord? Are you okay?"
Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,discord,"Pinkie Pie! Just the pony I need. [snaps fingers] As the party pony and Fluttershy's close <U+0096> but not best <U+0096> friend, I need your advice. I'm hosting a tea party for her, and it has to be perfect. No! It has to be even better than perfect!"
Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,pinkie pie,"Oh, Discord. You're waaaaaay overthinking things. All you have to do is make Fluttershy feel comfortable. It should be pretty easy for you. You know her so well!"
Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,discord,"And that's why you're the party expert. Thank you, Pinkie Pie. I feel so much better now."
Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,pinkie pie,"Eh, it's what I do."
Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,pinkie pie,"[to Cherry Fizzy] Excuse me! Where can I find the glowing, flying, self-folding napkins?"
Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,discord,"Make Fluttershy feel comfortable, make Fluttershy feel comfortable, comfortable, comfortable... Well, I mean, that shouldn't be a problem."
Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,discord,"Oh, dear. That might be a problem."
Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,discord,Maybe it's not as bad as I think. Maybe Fluttershy would be comfortable having a tea party here.
Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,discord,Maybe I just need another set of eyes on this. What do you think?
Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,discord,That bad?
Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,discord,"What to do, what to do, what to do... Oh!"
Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,discord,"Got it! We know Fluttershy, and we know what she likes. First of all, we need to get rid of all the new stuff."
Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,discord,Enjoy your all-expense-paid trip around Equestria!
Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,discord,"Well done, everybody, but there's still more work to do."
Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,discord,"We need to make this place more Fluttershy and less, well, me."
Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,discord,And I'm almost certain she likes stairs...
Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,discord,...that lead somewhere.
Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,discord,Phew!
Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,discord,Thank you!
Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,discord,But we're not done yet.
Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,discord,Mm-hmm.
Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,discord,"Okay, let's give these conversation cards a whirl. [clears throat, reading] ""It is very nice to see you today."" ""Have you read any good books lately?"" ""Your garden looks positively lovely."""
Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,discord,"Huh. Quite strange. For the first time in my life, I don't feel quite strange. In fact, I feel... completely normal. Everything is finally perfect for Fluttershy."
Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,fluttershy,Discord! I'm so excited to finally see where you live!
Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,discord,"G-Greetings, friend. Please do come in."
Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,fluttershy,I can't wait to see how... uh... Oh.
Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,discord,Is something amiss?
Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,fluttershy,"Um, no, no, not at all. It's just not what I expected. It's quite... lovely."
Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,discord,Please have a seat.
Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,fluttershy,Where is it?
Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,discord,Right here.
Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,fluttershy,Oh.
Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,discord,I think you'll be quite pleased with the green tea I've selected for us today.
Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,fluttershy,"Oooh! Does it actually turn us green? Is it really envious of the other teas? What's it do, what's it do?!"
Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,discord,"Uh, well, it tastes delicious."
Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,fluttershy,Oh... Okay.
Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,discord,What particularly nice weather we're having.
Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,fluttershy,"Yes... Yes, we are."
Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,discord,"[sips tea] It did rain the other day, however."
Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,fluttershy,Uh-huh...
Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,discord,But the weather today is particularly nice. ...As I previously mentioned. Would you care for some milk toast?
Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,fluttershy,"Uh, Discord, you don't seem to be yourself today. Are you feeling all right?"
Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,discord,Whatever do you mean?
Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,fluttershy,"Well, it's just... what you're wearing. And also what you're saying. And also the way you're saying it. And, um, pretty much everything else."
Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,discord,"Oh, dear Fluttershy, worry not. I can assure you that for the first time, I'm feeling perfectly normal. Now, let me top you off."
Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,discord,Oops! Butterfingers! How embarrassing.
Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,fluttershy,"Uh, what's going on?"
Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,discord,I have... no idea.
Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,fluttershy,[gasps] Discord! You're starting to fade away!
Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,discord,Huh. Have you tried the scones? They're positively delectable. The secret is in the extra butter.
Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,fluttershy,"What is wrong with you?! You're acting so normal, which is not so normal for you!"
Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,discord,"Well, whatever do you mean? This is just me being me."
Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,fluttershy,"No, it's not! It's you being like everypony else!"
Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,fluttershy,"Eeeek! The more you do it, the more you fade away! Of course! You're a creature of pure chaos! Being normal is destroying you!"
Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,discord,[laughs] How interesting. That reminds me of something I heard at the market today.
Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,fluttershy,"Stop it! Please! You need to go back to being your not-normal normal self! Quick, Discord! Uh, do something chaotic before it's too late! Please!"
Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,discord,Do something chaotic? I'll try...
Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,discord,"Ohhhh, that's not good..."
Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,fluttershy,"Oh, no! I tipped over that cup! That's pretty chaotic, right?"
Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,fluttershy,"[whimpers] What if I... [chomping, mouth full] Oh, my! Talking with food in my mouth after taking a bite from every sandwich! [gulps] How wacky! Doing anything for ya?"
Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,fluttershy,"[whimpers] Okay. Hmm. Maybe I need to start thinking like you. Ohhh... What would Discord do? Well, I guess he'd probably make another version of himself to bounce ideas off of."
Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,fluttershy,But one wouldn't be enough. He'd need more! Way more!
Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,fluttershy,"[to her reflections] Hey there, Fluttershys! Any ideas on how to Discord up this tea party? [higher-pitched] Hi, Fluttershy! Thanks for asking! First of all, you gotta redecorate this place. I mean, this is where Discord lives! And you're telling me there aren't any stairs that lead to nowhere? [speaking normally] On it!"
Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,fluttershy,"Better... but it still needs something. Now, that's more like it!"
Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,fluttershy,"[gasps] It's working! Okay, what else? Furniture on the ground? So predictable! Let's put them where they don't belong!"
Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,fluttershy,And he'd have a chaise lounge that would actually chase you! Because he's funny like that! Bet you can't catch me!
Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,fluttershy,Oh! And Discord would have a special kind of tea! Like a ginseng that could really sing!
Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,fluttershy,"And he'd serve it on a floating table! We never talked about it, but I'm pretty sure Discord hates gravity!"
Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,fluttershy,[laughs] Now this is exactly what I was hoping for!
Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,discord,This is what you were hoping for? But this is the complete opposite of your tea parties.
Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,fluttershy,I wouldn't expect you to throw a tea party the way I would. We're different!
Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,discord,"I know. I was afraid that if you saw exactly how different we are, you wouldn't want to be friends anymore."
Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,fluttershy,What?! Why would you ever think that?
Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,discord,Because you and I don't make sense to anypony else.
Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,fluttershy,"That may be true, but we make sense to me. I never would've thought to make singing ginseng before I met you. But you've opened me up to so many more possibilities and impossibilities. So I guess what I'm trying to say is I like you because you're so different from me."
Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,discord,You do?
Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,fluttershy,"Of course I do, silly! Besides, what's discord without a little chaos?"
Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,discord,"[chuckling] Well! In that case, I certainly don't need to be wearing this."
Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,discord,Oops! [laughs] I forgot that I still had this on!
Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,fluttershy,"[giggling] Now, about that tea party..."
Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,fluttershy,"You know, your garden really is looking lovely."
Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,discord,"Why, thank you for noticing. I also couldn't help but notice that you need a refill."
Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,fluttershy,Gesundheit.
Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,discord,It really is nice having you here.
Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,fluttershy,I'm happy to be here. And I really do like your place. Because it's so you.
Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,discord,"Why, thank you, Fluttershy."
Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,fluttershy,"Now, how about we try some of those delicious-looking sandwiches?"
Discordant Harmony,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,discord,[chuckles] You read my mind!
The Perfect Pear,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,apple bloom,Hmmm.
The Perfect Pear,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,apple bloom,[gasps] Thank you! You must be new. I'm Apple Bloom.
The Perfect Pear,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,apple bloom,Welcome to Ponyville!
The Perfect Pear,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,apple bloom,Really? Why'd ya move back?
The Perfect Pear,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,apple bloom,Huh. [chomps] This is delicious! [chomps] I can't believe I've gone my whole life without ever havin' this.
The Perfect Pear,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,apple bloom,How much?
The Perfect Pear,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,apple bloom,"Wow! Thanks, Mr. Grand Pear, sir! It was real nice meetin' you!"
The Perfect Pear,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,applejack,"Glad you're back, sugarcube. Just in time for breakfast for dinner."
The Perfect Pear,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,apple bloom,I got the perfect topper for flapjacks at the market today.
The Perfect Pear,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,applejack,[gasps] Pear jam?! What were you thinkin'?!
The Perfect Pear,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,applejack,Quick! Hide it!
The Perfect Pear,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,apple bloom,Huh?
The Perfect Pear,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,apple bloom,What's the big deal? It's just pear jam.
The Perfect Pear,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,applejack,The big deal is that there is a long-standing feud between the Apples and the Pears!
The Perfect Pear,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,big mcintosh,Eeyup!
The Perfect Pear,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,apple bloom,Why?
The Perfect Pear,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,applejack,"Why?! ...Well, uh, a-actually, I-I'm-I'm not really sure. You have any idea, Big Mac?"
The Perfect Pear,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,big mcintosh,Uhhh... nope.
The Perfect Pear,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,apple bloom,Then I guess we should ask Granny?
The Perfect Pear,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,granny smith,Ask me what?
The Perfect Pear,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,applejack,"Uh, what goes better with apple fritter flapjacks <U+0096> caramel syrup or praline!"
The Perfect Pear,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,granny smith,[blows raspberry] Praline.
The Perfect Pear,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,granny smith,"[sniffs] Oh-ho-ho, that smells great, Applejack. I'ma go wash up for supper. Be right back."
The Perfect Pear,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,applejack,"Listen, sugarcube. Anytime Big Mac and I ever asked Granny about the feud or the Pears, she'd get so upset she couldn't talk. Best not bring it up."
The Perfect Pear,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,apple bloom,"O-Okay, but that Grand Pear was really nice to me, even though I'm an Apple. I wonder what happened."
The Perfect Pear,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,applejack,"Me, too. But if we can't ask Granny, I don't know who<U+0097> We can ask Goldie Delicious! If anypony knows about the feud, it's the family historian!"
The Perfect Pear,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,apple bloom,"I'm in! What do you say, Big Mac? Siblin' trip first thing tomorrow?"
The Perfect Pear,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,big mcintosh,Eeyup!
The Perfect Pear,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,goldie delicious,"Now, that's how you make an entrance! Or is it an exit? [laughs] Well, anyway, it's so wonderful to see you three. To what do I owe the pleasure?"
The Perfect Pear,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,applejack,"Well, Goldie, we were hopin' you could tell us about the, uh... feud with the Apples and the Pears."
The Perfect Pear,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,goldie delicious,"Oh. Oh, dear. Well, does Granny Smith know you're here?"
The Perfect Pear,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,apple bloom,"No, ma'am. But I ran into Grand Pear yesterday, and he was real nice. Maybe the feud was a misunderstandin' or somethin', and we can fix it?"
The Perfect Pear,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,goldie delicious,"Oh, well, I don't know about that, little one. But if it's a story you're after, I suppose you have a right to know. Now, let's see, I got a stack of books here someplace... Oh! Apple Family History, Volume 137! Hmm, hmm... Here we are. ""Feud with the Bears"". I mean, ""Pears"". My eyes ain't what they used to be. A long time ago, Sweet Apple Acres wasn't the only farm in Ponyville. In fact, there was another one just right next door."
The Perfect Pear,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,goldie delicious,[voiceover] And so it went. Granny and Grand Pear were always at each other on who was the best farmer or who took better care of their trees. If Granny read to her trees at night...
The Perfect Pear,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,goldie delicious,"[voiceover] ...why, then Grand Pear had special blankets made for his trees so they wouldn't get cold."
The Perfect Pear,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,goldie delicious,"[voiceover] In fact, all the Apples and the Pears were rivals to the core! The only Apple and Pear who ever got along were Bright McIntosh and Pear Butter."
The Perfect Pear,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,applejack,[voiceover] Wait an apple-pickin' minute!
The Perfect Pear,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,applejack,Bright Mac and Buttercup? Those are our parents' names!
The Perfect Pear,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,goldie delicious,"Of course Buttercup was just a nickname your father gave your mother. Pear Butter <U+0096> well, that was her given name."
The Perfect Pear,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,applejack,Are you sayin' our mother was a... Pear?!
The Perfect Pear,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,big mcintosh,So we are half-Pear?!
The Perfect Pear,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,applejack,I can't believe it! How did we not know?!
The Perfect Pear,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,goldie delicious,"Well, uh, nopony called your mother Pear Butter."
The Perfect Pear,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,goldie delicious,"And her cutie mark was a preserve jar, but pear butter don't look too much different from apple butter, so no clues there."
The Perfect Pear,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,applejack,[sighs] Is there a-anythin' else you can tell us about them?
The Perfect Pear,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,apple bloom,Anything else?
The Perfect Pear,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,goldie delicious,Hmm... I'd need Volume 138 for that.
The Perfect Pear,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,goldie delicious,"I'm sure I could wrangle it... in a, in a couple of days."
The Perfect Pear,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,applejack,"[sighs] That's all right, Goldie. It was... nice just to hear<U+0097>"
The Perfect Pear,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,goldie delicious,Ooh-hoo-hoo! I just remembered somethin'! Your dad and his buddy Burnt Oak would get in all kinds of trouble together as colts.
The Perfect Pear,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,applejack,Burnt Oak? The firewood salespony? I haven't seen him in ages.
The Perfect Pear,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,goldie delicious,He and your dad were thick as thieves back in the day. Y'all should talk to him.
The Perfect Pear,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,applejack,You're right. We're not here for that.
The Perfect Pear,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,big mcintosh,"Uh, eeyup."
The Perfect Pear,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,apple bloom,"So Dad was super honest! Apple doesn't fall far from the tree, huh, Applejack?"
The Perfect Pear,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,apple bloom,"Did you know our mom, too?"
The Perfect Pear,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,apple bloom,Mrs. Cake?
The Perfect Pear,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,applejack,"Then let's go! Thanks, Burnt Oak!"
The Perfect Pear,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,big mcintosh,"Uh, would it be okay if we stopped by again sometime to hear more stories?"
The Perfect Pear,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,mrs. cake,"Mrs. Well, cinnamon sugar on toast! All three Apple siblings!"
The Perfect Pear,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,applejack,"Hi, Mrs. Cake. We heard you and our ma used to be real good friends, and we were hopin' you could tell us a bit about her."
The Perfect Pear,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,mrs. cake,"Mrs. Oh, I would love to. I never knew the right time to bring it up. But I'm so glad you came! [laughs] Uh, for starters, did you all know that it was your mom who convinced me to pursue baking?"
The Perfect Pear,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,apple bloom,But isn't your name Mrs. Cake?
The Perfect Pear,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,mrs. cake,"Mrs. Not always. Back when I was Chiffon Swirl, heh, I had no idea what I was supposed to do. But one day, your mom brought me some candied pears, eggs, flour, sugar, and vanilla, and told me to just be creative! Next thing I knew, I was whipping up pear upside-down cake, and I got my cutie mark! It was like she knew what I was supposed to do long before I did."
The Perfect Pear,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,applejack,"[to Apple Bloom] Just like you, sugarcube! Or rather, you're just like her!"
The Perfect Pear,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,mrs. cake,"Mrs. That was the first of many cakes for me, and Buttercup was with me through it all."
The Perfect Pear,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,mrs. cake,"Mrs. [voiceover] She'd be my taste-tester, help with the decorating, and prep new ingredients. Over the years, I perfected my recipes. Your mom did so much for me. One day, I wanted to surprise her with a cake."
The Perfect Pear,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,mrs. cake,Mrs. [voiceover] Then Pear Butter told me the sweetest love story I have ever heard.
The Perfect Pear,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,applejack,"I mean, I figured the Pears moved, but I didn't know all that stuff happened before with Granny and Grand Pear."
The Perfect Pear,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,apple bloom,It must've been really hard on our parents.
The Perfect Pear,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,mrs. cake,"Mrs. Oh, it was."
The Perfect Pear,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,mrs. cake,"Mrs. [voiceover] Pear Butter was devastated. But seeing no way out of it, she did what she had to do."
The Perfect Pear,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,mrs. cake,Mrs. [voiceover] Then Bright Mac did the most romantic thing I've ever seen anypony do.
The Perfect Pear,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,apple bloom,What?! What?!
The Perfect Pear,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,applejack,[simultaneous] What?! What did he do?!
The Perfect Pear,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,big mcintosh,[simultaneous] Tell us! Tell us!
The Perfect Pear,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,mrs. cake,Mrs. We're gonna need one more pony to tell that story.
The Perfect Pear,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,apple bloom,"Mayor Mare, you knew our parents?"
The Perfect Pear,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,mayor mare,"Not as well as Mrs. Cake, but I did play a part in their love story. The night before the Pear family moved, Bright Mac asked me to meet him at the edge of Sweet Apple Acres."
The Perfect Pear,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,mayor mare,"[voiceover] I had the honor of officiating your parents' secret wedding, and it was perfect. Bright Mac knew Buttercup wouldn't want a big splash."
The Perfect Pear,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,apple bloom,[voiceover] Reminds me of somepony else I know.
The Perfect Pear,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,big mcintosh,"[voiceover, chuckling] Eeyup."
The Perfect Pear,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,mayor mare,[voiceover] So they had a special way to seal their vows.
The Perfect Pear,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,granny smith,What is goin' on?! What's with all these here candles?!
The Perfect Pear,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,granny smith,"What are you talking about, married?! You two can't be married!"
The Perfect Pear,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,applejack,I can't believe Grand Pear just up and left Ma like that! No wonder Granny never told us about any of this.
The Perfect Pear,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,mrs. cake,Mrs. These things are never easy.
The Perfect Pear,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,mayor mare,And it's hard to know when it is a good time.
The Perfect Pear,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,applejack,It seems to me that now's as good a time as any.
The Perfect Pear,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,apple bloom,To talk to both our grandparents.
The Perfect Pear,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,apple bloom,Excuse me? Grand Pear?
The Perfect Pear,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,applejack,"I'm Applejack, and this here's Big McIntosh. But you already know who we are, don't ya?"
The Perfect Pear,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,apple bloom,Did you really move to Ponyville just for a change of pace?
The Perfect Pear,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,apple bloom,"Then you came here because you're sorry and that you wanted to get to know us, too?"
The Perfect Pear,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,apple bloom,"It's in the past, Grand Pear. Oh! Can I call you Grand Pear-Pear?"
The Perfect Pear,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,granny smith,Now where'd you all get to? I ain't seen hide or hair of ya's all day.
The Perfect Pear,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,applejack,We've been all over. Learnin' about our parents.
The Perfect Pear,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,granny smith,Guh... Y-You have?
The Perfect Pear,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,applejack,And our grandfather.
The Perfect Pear,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,granny smith,"So... you're back, huh?"
The Perfect Pear,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,apple bloom,"Findin' you and learnin' all about Mom and Dad, I feel like I found a piece of me I didn't even know was missin'."
The Perfect Pear,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,applejack,Hearin' their story makes me feel closer to them somehow.
The Perfect Pear,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,granny smith,I'm sorry. I should've told you all about 'em sooner.
The Perfect Pear,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,applejack,Nothing's keepin' ya from us now. Let's not miss anythin' else.
The Perfect Pear,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,granny smith,"Applejack's right. Welcome back, prickly old pear. Heh."
The Perfect Pear,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,apple bloom,"Now that we're all together, there's somethin' we want to show you. Mom and Dad left us somethin' to remember them by. Come on!"
The Perfect Pear,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,granny smith,[sounds of awe] It's beautiful.
The Perfect Pear,Joanna Lewis & Kristine Songco,applejack,"If anything's gonna make it through, it's apples and pears."
Fame and Misfortune,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,Whoa!
Fame and Misfortune,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Toola Roola, Coconut Cream, what are you doing?!"
Fame and Misfortune,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Both of you, stop!"
Fame and Misfortune,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"...So you see, friendship isn't always easy, but there's no doubt, it's worth fighting for."
Fame and Misfortune,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,[humming and hmm-ing] No... Aha! Here it is.
Fame and Misfortune,M. A. Larson,starlight glimmer,What is that?
Fame and Misfortune,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Come on, Starlight, don't judge a book by its cover. This is the friendship journal my friends and I used to keep. It's filled with all the things we've learned, like: ""Friendship isn't always easy, but there's no doubt, it's worth fighting for."""
Fame and Misfortune,M. A. Larson,starlight glimmer,I'll judge a book by its cover just this once.
Fame and Misfortune,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Thanks for coming, everypony. I've got a surprise for you."
Fame and Misfortune,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,"What is it, Twilight? Do I need to prepare myself?"
Fame and Misfortune,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,It's this!
Fame and Misfortune,M. A. Larson,rarity,"Ugh, what is that thing? Why is it so smelly?"
Fame and Misfortune,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,Wait a minute. [gasps] Is this our old friendship journal? I haven't seen this thing in forever!
Fame and Misfortune,M. A. Larson,applejack,"Hoo-wee! It's lookin' a little, uh... overripe."
Fame and Misfortune,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,I'll say!
Fame and Misfortune,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,There's a smushed apple in Applejack's lessons.
Fame and Misfortune,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,"Fluttershy's lessons are so small, you can barely read them."
Fame and Misfortune,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,"I, uh, wanted to leave room for all of you."
Fame and Misfortune,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,I-I don't even know what this is.
Fame and Misfortune,M. A. Larson,rarity,"It is called calligraphy, darling. If you're going to make words, at least make them fabulous."
Fame and Misfortune,M. A. Larson,applejack,"Looks like you got a little aggressive with your friendship lessons, Rainbow Dash."
Fame and Misfortune,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,"What can I say? When I learn something, I learn it hard."
Fame and Misfortune,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,[unimpressed] I found Pinkie's page.
Fame and Misfortune,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,"[giggles] Well, I am surprised!"
Fame and Misfortune,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,That wasn't the only surprise.
Fame and Misfortune,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,Ta-da! Starlight and I decided to make one for each of you!
Fame and Misfortune,M. A. Larson,applejack,That's amazin'! A perfect copy!
Fame and Misfortune,M. A. Larson,starlight glimmer,I learned the spell years ago when I needed to make copies of a certain<U+0097> [long pause] [clears throat] ...manifesto.
Fame and Misfortune,M. A. Larson,rarity,[sniffs] Ahhh! Even better than a perfect copy.
Fame and Misfortune,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,"Oh, I'd forgotten all about this lesson."
Fame and Misfortune,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,"[laughing] Remember this one from when I helped Daring Do? ""Never underestimate the power of friends who always got your back."""
Fame and Misfortune,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,"Aww, Cheese Sandwich! Party cannon! Ah! Birth-iversary!"
Fame and Misfortune,M. A. Larson,starlight glimmer,"After Twilight remembered the journal, I had so much fun reading all the stuff you've all learned, I just had to have my own copy."
Fame and Misfortune,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"And that brings me to the second part of the surprise. My idea. How would you girls feel about making our journal available for everypony? If we can get these lessons into other ponies' hooves, maybe they'll benefit from them."
Fame and Misfortune,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,"Well, I think that's a great idea."
Fame and Misfortune,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,I'm in! Yay!
Fame and Misfortune,M. A. Larson,applejack,W-We always said we wanted to.
Fame and Misfortune,M. A. Larson,rarity,Sounds fabulous.
Fame and Misfortune,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,[laughing] I'm awesome.
Fame and Misfortune,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,"Oh, yeah. Uh, good idea."
Fame and Misfortune,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Hey, girls. Couldn't help but overhear. You might want to take a breather, maybe read Rainbow Dash's chapter on Rainbow Falls? It might help."
Fame and Misfortune,M. A. Larson,apple bloom,"Thanks, Twilight! The friendship journal's makin' us super popular!"
Fame and Misfortune,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,Oh.
Fame and Misfortune,M. A. Larson,apple bloom,"We were thinkin' of puttin' together a cutie mark summer camp. Now, everypony's definitely gonna sign up for it! This is gonna be awesome! [laughs] Cutie Mark Crusaders, whoo."
Fame and Misfortune,M. A. Larson,starlight glimmer,A cutie mark camp is a great idea.
Fame and Misfortune,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Yeah, but the purpose of the journal isn't supposed to be marketing."
Fame and Misfortune,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,I just hope those foals actually learn something from our lessons.
Fame and Misfortune,M. A. Larson,starlight glimmer,They will! I'm sure ponies all across Equestria will<U+0097> Whoa!
Fame and Misfortune,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Uh, hello! Can I... help you?"
Fame and Misfortune,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,Wow! How wonderful! What was your favorite friendship<U+0097>
Fame and Misfortune,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Oh, uh, I guess so. So, what did you think of the lessons?"
Fame and Misfortune,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,Oh.
Fame and Misfortune,M. A. Larson,starlight glimmer,"Don't worry, Twilight. I'm sure lots of other ponies are being inspired to be better friends."
Fame and Misfortune,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,But that's not what she was saying! Rarity!
Fame and Misfortune,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Oh, poor Rarity. She overheard all the mean things those ponies were saying. She must be devastated. I'm going after her."
Fame and Misfortune,M. A. Larson,starlight glimmer,Go ahead. I'm gonna have a chat with these two.
Fame and Misfortune,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Rarity, wait!"
Fame and Misfortune,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,Twilight! Isn't it amazing? Our journals are everywhere!
Fame and Misfortune,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Pinkie, I've got to<U+0097>"
Fame and Misfortune,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,Ponies keep stopping by to tell me my entries are hilarious!
Fame and Misfortune,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,I even had somepony come all the way from Las Pegasus to say how much he liked my lessons!
Fame and Misfortune,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,I am so glad to hear some ponies are being inspired by the journal.
Fame and Misfortune,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,Giggly feedback is the best kind!
Fame and Misfortune,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Well, at least you're getting a positive reaction. I just saw Rarity, and I'm afraid this whole journal thing really upset her."
Fame and Misfortune,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,"Aww, that's too bad."
Fame and Misfortune,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,Wait. That wasn't even funny.
Fame and Misfortune,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"O-kay. Well, I guess I'll catch you later."
Fame and Misfortune,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,"Yup. Bye, Twilight!"
Fame and Misfortune,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,You've known me for years!
Fame and Misfortune,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,Maybe it's time to call it a day.
Fame and Misfortune,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,What do you mean you skipped the lessons? We've all had valuable experiences.
Fame and Misfortune,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,"Hey, here's a great idea! Why don't you guys talk to Twilight for a while? So I can get back to things like working and napping and, well, pretty much anything else."
Fame and Misfortune,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,[laughs nervously] Again? Haven't we already covered that one? A couple dozen times?
Fame and Misfortune,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,"Uh... It's just that I, uh, really need to get those storm clouds back in their... pens."
Fame and Misfortune,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Oh, what's going on now?"
Fame and Misfortune,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,"Please, just leave me alone!"
Fame and Misfortune,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Fluttershy, what's wrong?"
Fame and Misfortune,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"What is it, everypony?"
Fame and Misfortune,M. A. Larson,starlight glimmer,What? Really?! Are you attacking my friend because you want to be in a book?!
Fame and Misfortune,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,"It's okay. I got this, girls. [inhales] Listen up! I am more assertive! And yes, it took me a while to get there. But can you honestly say that you could learn something one time and completely change who you are? [beat] I didn't think so."
Fame and Misfortune,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"It feels like everypony in Equestria is missing the ""friendship"" part of the friendship journals."
Fame and Misfortune,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,What are you doing?
Fame and Misfortune,M. A. Larson,rarity,"Why, I'm creating a gown, darling!"
Fame and Misfortune,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,For what?
Fame and Misfortune,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,Stress-sewing?
Fame and Misfortune,M. A. Larson,rarity,"When I overheard those two at the cafe, I suddenly understood why I've been getting cancellations for days!"
Fame and Misfortune,M. A. Larson,starlight glimmer,What? Why are ponies cancelling their orders?
Fame and Misfortune,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"I'm sure if I go out there and talk to those ponies, they'll see that they're being unreasonable."
Fame and Misfortune,M. A. Larson,applejack,"[panting] I need a hundred blankets, and I need 'em now! Sorry, Twilight."
Fame and Misfortune,M. A. Larson,rarity,"Right away, pony-who-still-likes-me!"
Fame and Misfortune,M. A. Larson,applejack,I don't need nothin' fancy.
Fame and Misfortune,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"What's the matter, Applejack?"
Fame and Misfortune,M. A. Larson,applejack,"I'm popular, Twilight! I'm popular, and I don't like it one bit!"
Fame and Misfortune,M. A. Larson,starlight glimmer,You go ahead. I'll stay here.
Fame and Misfortune,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Applejack, who are all these ponies?"
Fame and Misfortune,M. A. Larson,applejack,"They call themselves the Sweet Apple Admirers. They say they read my journal entries, and they felt like a part of the family. And now they actually wanna become part of the family!"
Fame and Misfortune,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,Your journal entries?
Fame and Misfortune,M. A. Larson,applejack,"Yeah, you know, all the stuff about how friends are like family and whatnot?"
Fame and Misfortune,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,Can't you get rid of them?
Fame and Misfortune,M. A. Larson,applejack,"And kick out my own family?! Granny Smith, hang on! Let me help!"
Fame and Misfortune,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,[sighs] I wish we'd never released that journal.
Fame and Misfortune,M. A. Larson,starlight glimmer,"There you are! Okay, I just left Rarity. I think she's doing better, and<U+0097> Oh, boy. Window-staring, huh? Was it that bad at Sweet Apple Acres?"
Fame and Misfortune,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,It's bad everywhere. I thought I was doing something good. I thought I was helping. How could our friendship journal have led to so much... anti-friendship?!
Fame and Misfortune,M. A. Larson,starlight glimmer,"Oh, Twilight, it's not your fault."
Fame and Misfortune,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Of course it's my fault! If I hadn't had the big idea to make copies, none of this would be happening! I'm afraid I made life awful for my friends!"
Fame and Misfortune,M. A. Larson,starlight glimmer,I really think you're being too hard on yourself.
Fame and Misfortune,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,Am I?!
Fame and Misfortune,M. A. Larson,applejack,I didn't know where else to go! I've got so much cookin' and cleanin' and family-in' to do... I ain't got time for anythin' else!
Fame and Misfortune,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,"At least ponies aren't laughing every time you talk! Not even I want to be funny all the time! I'm telling you, my days of hilariosity-ness-ness are over!"
Fame and Misfortune,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,"You think you've got problems? I know I'm awesome, but I can't even go to the bathroom without somepony trying to tell me how cool I am! [beat] Uh, Rarity? What are you wearing?"
Fame and Misfortune,M. A. Larson,rarity,"My emotions, darling! Stress couture!"
Fame and Misfortune,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,I don't know what I'm gonna do if I have to defend myself one more time!
Fame and Misfortune,M. A. Larson,rarity,"Hmm? Oh, uh, sorry, darling. Force of habit."
Fame and Misfortune,M. A. Larson,starlight glimmer,"Okay, so maybe they are having a hard time with it. That doesn't mean you did anything wrong."
Fame and Misfortune,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Yes, I did! Releasing the journal was my idea, and it backfired in ways I could never have imagined!"
Fame and Misfortune,M. A. Larson,starlight glimmer,"It's not your fault. It's everypony else's! They're just focusing on the wrong things, and<U+0097> [gasps] Wait here! I've got an idea!"
Fame and Misfortune,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,I can't wait any longer. I've got to fix this.
Fame and Misfortune,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Everypony, please stop!"
Fame and Misfortune,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"I moved here to learn about friendship. That's why the journal even exists. It took some time for me to get the hang of it, but it was each of these ponies standing next to me who taught me the lessons in those journals. Applejack, Pinkie Pie, Rainbow Dash, Rarity, and Fluttershy, too. Then it was all of you. I've learned so much from<U+0097>"
Fame and Misfortune,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"""Believable""?"
Fame and Misfortune,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"My character?! We are real ponies! This journal is a record of things that actually happened to us! We made mistakes, and we learned from them!"
Fame and Misfortune,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Wait a minute, everypony!"
Fame and Misfortune,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,Listen to me! [amplified] Listen to me!
Fame and Misfortune,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,I never claimed to be perfect My mistakes are all written in ink None of us claimed to be perfect And it's sad if that's what you all think
Fame and Misfortune,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,They say I'm a big shot That my ego's the size of a whale My confidence comes off as cocky But it gives me the courage to fail
Fame and Misfortune,M. A. Larson,rarity,"Sure, I can be a drama queen A bit stuck-up, it's true"
Fame and Misfortune,M. A. Larson,applejack,"And I can be too eager to please There's such thing as bein' too honest, too, 'cause"
Fame and Misfortune,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,Ponies think I'm all bubbles and laughter That I don't seem sincere I might joke around a little too much But I'm just so happy you're here
Fame and Misfortune,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,It took me a while to be confident To really come out of my shell
Fame and Misfortune,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"But nopony has to be perfect By now, don't you know us so well? Because, yeah"
Fame and Misfortune,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"So you see, everypony? None of us ever claimed to be perfect. Without our flaws, there wouldn't be any friendship lessons to learn. Without our flaws... there probably wouldn't be any friendships at all."
Fame and Misfortune,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,So that just happened.
Fame and Misfortune,M. A. Larson,starlight glimmer,Girls! I found two ponies who have something I think you should hear.
Fame and Misfortune,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,Really?
Fame and Misfortune,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Oh, I can't tell you how much it means to hear that. Thank you for telling us. We've had a tough couple of days, but knowing we've helped fillies like you..."
Fame and Misfortune,M. A. Larson,applejack,It makes everythin' we've been through worth it.
Fame and Misfortune,M. A. Larson,rarity,Absolutely. Fads come and go. Friendship is forever.
Fame and Misfortune,M. A. Larson,rainbow dash,There are worse things than not being able to do anything without being told I'm awesome.
Fame and Misfortune,M. A. Larson,fluttershy,And we can't change the way other ponies think about us. But we can change how we let it affect us.
Fame and Misfortune,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,Or how we don't let it affect us!
Fame and Misfortune,M. A. Larson,pinkie pie,[giggles] Go ahead! Laugh!
Fame and Misfortune,M. A. Larson,applejack,"Reckon we still have to deal with them, don't we?"
Fame and Misfortune,M. A. Larson,twilight sparkle,"Stay in the friendship moment, Applejack. They can wait a little longer."
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,spike,"Is the banner even? Are the flowers in place? By which I mean ""completely out of view"". I'm pretty sure dragons don't like flowers. And what about the Ceremonial Dragon Fire Flame of Friendship? Is it still flaming?"
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,twilight sparkle,"Spike, everything looks great! You're getting yourself worked up for no reason."
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,spike,"I have lots of reasons. In fact, I wrote them down."
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,starlight glimmer,[sighs] You've been hanging around Twilight for too long.
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,spike,Reason number one <U+0096> I invited Dragon Lord Ember to Ponyville today. Reason two <U+0096> the Dragon Lord is a dragon. Reason three <U+0096> she's coming here to learn more about friendship.
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,twilight sparkle,"According to Ember's letters, the dragons are trying to be friends, but competing is in their nature, and it's leading to more and more fights."
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,spike,"Which brings me to to reason number four. The Dragon Lord wants my advice, and as the new official Equestrian friendship ambassador to the dragons, I can't let her down."
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,twilight sparkle,"I know you feel a lot of pressure, but you've got this, Spike!"
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,spike,I... I just want things to be perfect.
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,spike,[gasps] Thorax! You're in Ponyville!
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,thorax,"Of course I am, silly! You invited me. And I'm not one to back out of an invitation. Hey, Twilight! Hey, Starlight!"
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,thorax,"Oooh! I can't believe you did all this for me! Great banner! Love the stage! What's this flame thingy? Oh, it's pretty!"
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,twilight sparkle,"[whispering, to Spike] You invited Thorax over to Ponyville on the same day as Ember?!"
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,spike,Apparently.
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,starlight glimmer,That doesn't seem like a good idea. How are you gonna entertain them both?
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,starlight glimmer,"Well, maybe they'll like each other."
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,spike,Probably not. Ember is tough and self-assured and intimidating. And Thorax is...
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,thorax,"Spike, I'm so glad you invited me! You are one of my closest, nicest, most caring, most understanding friends ever! Ooh! Is that ice in the shape of a dragon?"
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,starlight glimmer,"Yeah, I see your point. They might not get each other."
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,twilight sparkle,I'm sure that won't happen. Now pull it together.
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,spike,"So, heh, Thorax, heh, everything good with you?"
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,thorax,"Well, honestly, no. Not really. I have indigestion. Not sure if it's the new diet or stress. Or maybe it's both."
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,spike,No!
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,thorax,"Yeah, it really could be both. And it might be affecting my sleeping, too. I'm a real tosser and turner."
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,spike,"Sounds like you really need to unwind. Uh, how about a, uh... a trip to the castle? Heh. You can't miss that view."
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,twilight sparkle,"Yes, the castle! I'll give you a personal tour!"
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,thorax,"Uh, aren't you coming?"
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,spike,"Yeah, I'm just gonna... grab some ice cream for us and catch up. Heh-heh."
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,spike,"Dragon Lord Ember, as the official Equestrian friendship ambassador for the Dragon Lands and for Ponyville, I, Spike of Ponyville, welcome you to... uh, Ponyville. [quietly, to himself] I gotta work on my official speech."
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,ember,"Okay, thanks. [chuckles] Right. The hug thing."
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,ember,That's probably why.
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,ember,"Hey, Twilight!"
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,starlight glimmer,"Actually, I'm Starlight. Starlight Glimmer. Nice to meet you."
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,ember,"Oh, sorry. I'm really gonna have to get used to these pony names. Lots of ""-lights"" and shiny things. So, where is Twilight?"
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,spike,She's in her castle. D'oh!
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,ember,"We should go visit her then. Part of friendship is saying ""hi"" to your friends, right?"
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,ember,You're making weird noises. Do you have a stomachache?
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,spike,Dah. I think I feel one coming on.
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,ember,"Well, you know what us dragons say. ""Push past the pain!"" Now, let's go."
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,spike,Or we could stay here.
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,ember,Or I could go without you.
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,starlight glimmer,"[laughs] Ah, I like her."
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,spike,Ohhh.
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,spike,Good. They're not here.
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,ember,What was that?
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,spike,"Uh, I... I said, ""It's all clean in here!"" Uh, you must be hungry from your travels. Please, I'd love to present you with an official friendship welcome banquet."
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,starlight glimmer,"Actually, that's not food."
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,spike,[aside] Dragons love gems!
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,starlight glimmer,"Fine, but you're telling Twilight what happened to her wall."
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,spike,"Just keep her here. [to Ember] Okay, yeah! [laughs] Enjoy all the, uh... crystal... things!"
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,ember,Where are you going? I thought this was an official friendship banquet.
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,spike,Just gotta use the little dragons' room!
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,twilight sparkle,So this is my comfy chair for fictional reads. [grunts] This is my studying chair because the hard back keeps me awake.
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,thorax,"Oh, Spike! I'm so glad you're here! [quietly] This castle visit is getting weird. Twilight really likes chairs. Oh, what happened to the ice cream?"
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,spike,"What? Oh, right! Uh, they ran out. Heh. Hey, I'm really sorry, but I gotta borrow Twilight quickly."
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,twilight sparkle,Aah!
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,spike,Be right back!
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,spike,Ember's here!
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,twilight sparkle,I know. I saw you coming and had to distract Thorax by showing him chairs. Why did you bring Ember to the castle of all places?
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,spike,"I don't know! Ember was asking for you, Thorax wants to talk with me. We need to switch places! They might be getting suspicious."
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,twilight sparkle,All we have to do is make both Thorax and Ember feel special and keep them apart for a few more hours. We can do this.
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,twilight sparkle,"I think it's the map. It's calling... you. Apparently, you also have to solve a friendship problem!"
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,spike,The map is calling me?!
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,twilight sparkle,"Oh, amazing! The map is really reaching out!"
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,twilight sparkle,Not a good time? I get it.
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,starlight glimmer,"Spike, are you here? Ember's eaten all of Twilight's decorations, and<U+0097>oh! Hey, Twilight! [chuckles, gasps] Glowing map... [gulps] Glowing spikes... That's not good."
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,spike,I know!
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,starlight glimmer,At least your friendship problem is in Ponyville? Heh.
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,spike,"Okay, okay. To pull this off, I'm gonna need both of you to help. You two need to keep Ember and Thorax separate while I get ice cream."
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,twilight sparkle,"You mean ""find the friendship problem""."
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,spike,Yeeeees! Go easy on me. I'm under a lot of pressure.
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,spike,Friendship problem? Anypony gotta friendship problem here? Any problems to solve? Friendship problems? Friendship problems! Anypony got a friendship problem here? No? Okay.
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,sweetie drops,Hmph.
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,spike,"Yes! Fighting! Uh, I mean, what seems to be the problem?"
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,twilight sparkle,"Ember, there you are!"
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,ember,"Okay, right. More pony hugs."
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,twilight sparkle,How's your trip to Ponyville so far?
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,ember,"Well, I'm certainly learning a lot about friendship. I had no idea it was polite to decorate your walls in your friends' favorite foods!"
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,twilight sparkle,"[laughs nervously] Oh, my."
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,twilight sparkle,"Nooooo. They're just making sure everything is perfect for your welcome party later. In the meantime, how about I show you around town?"
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,ember,Sounds good. I can't exactly learn about friendship if I don't make new friends.
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,thorax,Oh!
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,starlight glimmer,"Uh, hey, Thorax. Um, Twilight and Spike had some boring official paperwork to deal with, so looks like you and I get to hang out. What would you like to do?"
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,thorax,But I wanted to talk with Spike. He said he'd be right back.
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,starlight glimmer,"Oh, you will. But first, how about we grab a bite to eat?"
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,thorax,"Huh. Well, you know, now that you've said it, I am a little hungry. Is there a dining room in the castle?"
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,starlight glimmer,"No! I mean, yeah, but that's castle food. If you want the good stuff, we gotta go to town. Phew!"
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,spike,...and that's why you should never let cupcake flavors get in the way of your friendship.
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,spike,"Oh, come on! Glow!"
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,thorax,"Spike! There you are! Uh, done with your boring paperwork, I see."
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,starlight glimmer,[laughs nervously] Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,spike,Yep. [laughs] I am done with whatever Starlight says I was doing.
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,starlight glimmer,"Thorax wanted to get out of the castle. I thought coming to town was a really, really great idea."
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,thorax,"Well, maybe now we can talk."
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,spike,"Uh, sssssure."
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,starlight glimmer,I'll leave you guys to it.
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,thorax,"First of all, I want to say thank you for having me over. I'm in a bit of a leadership pickle, and I could use some advice."
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,spike,"Well, I definitely want to help you out as quickly as possible."
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,ember,"Usually when I do that, the dragons are eager to meet me."
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,twilight sparkle,That's not how ponies make friends.
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,ember,"Ah, I get it."
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,ember,"This is a weird friendship thing you ponies do, right?"
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,starlight glimmer,"Uh, you guys are in town, too?"
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,ember,What are you talking about? You've been with me this whole time.
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,starlight glimmer,No. I'm Starlight.
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,ember,"Riiiight. I'm sorry, but you can't blame me. You both look and act so much alike."
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,thorax,"...and they said to me they just keep saying the same thing. You know, I think my leadership problem started in childhood. I must've been three when... [crossfades] ...three's a different story, a-and you've definitely gotta hear it. But the story about my brother was when I was two... or was I one?"
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,spike,"Thorax, uh, excuse me for a second."
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,thorax,"Hey, that was really great advice. So what do you think I should do?"
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,spike,"[gasps] Uh, actually, I, uh... need a minute... alone... to, uh, really come up with great advice! [pants] I'll be right back."
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,thorax,[sighs] Great. No problem. Leave me again. It's fine.
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,ember,I'm just saying you're both purple ponies with purple hair. You both have cutie marks with sparkly things.
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,starlight glimmer,[chuckles] Mine's more of a glimmer. Heh.
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,ember,"How is that different? Oh, good. Spike. Can you please tell these two I'm right? They look very similar."
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,spike,"Uh... Well, y'know, one thing friends do is let something go when it's upsetting somepony else."
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,ember,"But I'm right! Besides, who are you to be telling me about friendship? I've barely seen you all day!"
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,spike,"Uh, well, I've seen you."
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,ember,Are you calling me a liar?!
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,thorax,Hey! No one yells at my friend!
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,ember,"Spike, get away from the bear!"
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,twilight sparkle,"Actually, the bear is a changeling. And he's quite gentle."
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,spike,[screams] My worst fears are happening!
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,spike,Noooo!
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,thorax,"[pants] Back away, Spike! I'm not gonna let this dragon harm a scale on your back!"
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,ember,You back away! I'm not gonna let you harm him! Wait. Did you say you're not gonna let me harm Spike?
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,thorax,Yeah!
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,ember,But that's what I'm doing!
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,thorax,"Uh, what?"
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,ember,"Yeah, what?"
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,spike,[panicked] Equestria as we know it is over! The war that pits changeling against dragon is about to begin! And it's all my fault! My title of Equestria's friendship ambassador is a lie<U+0097>! Oh. Hey. You guys aren't fighting?
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,ember,Why would we be fighting?
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,spike,Because I accidentally invited you both over to Ponyville on the same day?
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,spike,So I... was trying to keep you apart because I didn't think you'd get along.
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,ember,Oh. I get it. You thought he wouldn't like me just because I'm a dragon and I'm bad at friendship?
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,spike,"No, no, of course not! But<U+0097> Wait. Isn't that why you're here?"
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,ember,I can say I'm bad at friendship. You can't say it about me! You know what? I don't wanna talk about it.
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,spike,"Wait, please! [sighs] [to Thorax] I'm sorry."
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,thorax,"No, no, it's cool. You thought I would be too soft, and someone like Ember would never respect me. Just like my own changelings!"
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,spike,"No, that's not it! Thorax, wait! Oh, no... What have I done?"
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,ember,Why are you still here?
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,thorax,"[sighs] Because I'm having trouble leading my pack, so I don't really wanna go home."
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,ember,"Wait, you're in charge? [chuckles] Oh, boy. You need to be more assertive."
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,thorax,"Well, that's my problem. I don't know how! I tried asking them to please follow my directions. I even offered a prize, and then<U+0097>"
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,ember,Shhh! Stop talking.
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,ember,That's how you do it.
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,thorax,Whoa! That just gave me chills.
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,ember,I know you have it in you. You turned into a bear to defend Spike.
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,thorax,"Huh, I guess I can be tough when I'm defending my friends, but when I'm just enforcing my rules, I-I feel unsure of myself."
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,ember,"There's nothing to be unsure of. You're the leader for a reason. Make a decision and let it be known that the decision is final. And if that doesn't work, turn into a bear."
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,thorax,"Oh, well, that's good advice."
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,ember,I know it is.
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,thorax,So what's your deal? Why do you think you're so bad at friendship?
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,ember,I don't want to talk about it.
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,thorax,"Oh, you have to! How else are you gonna solve your problems?"
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,thorax,"Uh, how does that help?"
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,ember,Crushing another dragon in competition establishes my dominance and makes me feel great.
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,thorax,"Right, but, uh, how do you think they feel?"
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,ember,Humiliated! Ashamed! They'd probably wanna run away and bury themselves under a rock and... never come out. They're probably sad. Kinda low. Definitely not happy.
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,thorax,That's because that kind of competition can divide you. And it doesn't get to the heart of the issue. Talking about your feelings does.
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,ember,[sneezes] Ugh! I think I'm allergic to feelings.
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,thorax,You know you don't have to be sappy...
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,thorax,...or huggy-feely about it! But you should let your friends know how you feel.
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,ember,"Uh, I know where we can start."
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,thorax,Where? Ohhhh. Spike. Hah. I got there.
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,spike,I think they're gone. They probably never want to see me again.
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,starlight glimmer,Or they want to see you now.
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,ember,"Guess what, Spike."
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,spike,I know. I'm so sorry.
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,thorax,Okaaaay... That's a good first attempt. Now maybe try to be more specific?
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,ember,"[cracks limbs, breathes deeply] I'm... [sighs] upset!"
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,spike,You have every right to be.
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,ember,I know I do! And I know I need to tell you how I feel because my friend Thorax said it would make me feel better. And it does!
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,thorax,Yeah! And I have no problem telling you what you did was wrong because my friend Ember is helping me be more assertive!
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,spike,Whoa.
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,ember,Nice.
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,spike,"You guys should be mad at me. I was so worried about how it could go wrong, I didn't even think about how it could go right. [sighs] Can you forgive me?"
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,ember,"I really do feel better. So, yeah. I'm good."
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,ember,[groans] Again?
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,spike,No way! It's finally happening! I solved the friendship problem!
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,starlight glimmer,"Actually, you created the friendship problem by not trusting your friends."
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,spike,"Yeah, but then I solved it by learning my lesson. I should have told my two friends about each other immediately instead of assuming they wouldn't get along."
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,twilight sparkle,"Good job, Spike."
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,ember,Is this another part of pony friendship? Telling each other what you learned all the time?
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,starlight glimmer,"Yeah, pretty much."
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,spike,Yup.
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,spike,"[through loudspeaker] So, as a show of unity, I present the Dragon Fire Flame of Friendship to both Dragon Lord Ember and Thorax, leader of the changeling pack! May the flame of friendship burn for eternity."
Triple Threat,Josh Hamilton,ember,You should have more things made of rocks.
Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,applejack,"[straining] [muffled] Hey, kid, get over here!"
Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,applejack,"Tents are lookin' good. And we made good time today. At this rate, we'll be at Winsome Falls by tomorrow!"
Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,apple bloom,We should do the annual Big-Sister-Little-Sister camping trip every weekend!
Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,applejack,"Then it wouldn't be annual. And if we did it every weekend, it probably wouldn't be as special."
Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,apple bloom,"But the more we do it, the better we get at camping. Remember the first time we came here and Rarity had that ginormous tent?"
Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,rarity,"I heard that! [giggles] I've gotten much better at ""roughing it"", haven't I?"
Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,sweetie belle,"Yup. This time, you only packed three suitcases."
Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,rarity,"I know what you're thinking. But I promise, I only brought the essentials."
Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,applejack,Like those light thingies?
Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,rarity,Of course. What is life if you can't make it beautiful?
Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,rainbow dash,Mmmm! These berries look good enough to eat!
Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,scootaloo,"Don't! According to my book, they're extremely poisonous!"
Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,rainbow dash,What?
Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,scootaloo,"I heard something, I stepped on something, and I saw that creepy cave... I guess I still get a little bit scared out here, even after the last camping trip."
Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,rainbow dash,"Don't worry, kid. You've got a big sister this time."
Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,apple bloom,This looks amazing!
Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,scootaloo,This is gonna be the best Big-Sister-Slash-Little-Sister camping trip ever!
Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,scootaloo,Ow! What are these things?! Aaagh!
Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,applejack,"Fly-ders! Everypony, run for cover! Don't get stuck in their<U+0097>"
Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,applejack,...web.
Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,sweetie belle,[shrieks] Now what?!
Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,rainbow dash,"Follow me, everypony!"
Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,scootaloo,Aaah! Not the scary cave!
Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,scootaloo,Where did those terrible bugs come from? And why did they destroy our camp?
Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,rainbow dash,Ugh.
Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,applejack,"Flyders are from the Luna Bay area. Never seen 'em this far east, though. Probably attracted to the food. Best wait here until they're gone."
Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,apple bloom,"Oh, apple rot! What are we supposed to do now?! We had games to play and marshmallows to roast at camp! In here, we got nothin'!"
Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,rarity,"Mm, that's not entirely true. We have each other."
Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,applejack,"That's right! And if you girls want to, maybe we could tell some stories to pass the time."
Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,rainbow dash,You want stories? I've got a ton of stories! Spoiler alert <U+0096> they're all about me and how awesome I am!
Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,applejack,I was thinkin' more like campfire stories?
Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,apple bloom,But we don't even have a campfire.
Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,rainbow dash,I got this!
Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,applejack,Wow. That was brave.
Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,scootaloo,"We aren't gonna tell scary stories like our last camping trip, are we? It's bad enough just being in here!"
Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,applejack,"Don't worry, Scootaloo. I was gonna tell you mine and Apple Bloom's favorite legend."
Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,apple bloom,"Ooh! You mean Rockhoof? I love that one! He was so strong, and when he<U+0097>"
Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,sweetie belle,"Apple Bloom, shhh! We haven't heard it yet!"
Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,apple bloom,"Oh, okay. But it's so good! Heh."
Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,applejack,"Well, it's true. Rockhoof was known far and wide for his incredible strength. But he didn't start out that way. You see, Rockhoof was a tiny little fella, the son of a farmer."
Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,apple bloom,Just like us!
Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,applejack,They lived in a village that sat at the foot of a gigantic volcano.
Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,applejack,[narrating] And the village was protected by an elite group of guard ponies called the Mighty Helm.
Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,applejack,[narrating] Young Rockhoof wanted nothing more than to be part of the Mighty Helm.
Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,applejack,[narrating] But he was told that he was too scrawny and weak to protect the village.
Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,applejack,[narrating] But Rockhoof wouldn't take no for an answer.
Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,applejack,"[narrating] Then, one fateful day..."
Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,applejack,[narrating] ...the volcano erupted!
Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,rockhoof,Eeeeeeeeeeee<U+0097>
Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,apple bloom,[continued] <U+0097>eeeeeeeeee! This is my favorite part!
Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,applejack,The molten lava poured down the side of the volcano...
Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,applejack,"[narrating] ...and try as they might, the Mighty Helm couldn't figure out a way to save the village! They had to evacuate. But the village ponies didn't wanna leave their homes. They spent their entire lives there. They had nowhere else to go! So Rockhoof decided to do something crazy."
Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,applejack,"[narrating] He thought if he could divert the flow of the lava, he might be able to save his village. He started diggin' a trench!"
Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,sweetie belle,Wait a minute. All by himself?
Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,rainbow dash,"It'd be impossible for one pony to dig a trench fast enough to stop the lava. I mean, even I couldn't do that."
Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,applejack,"Good thing Rockhoof didn't believe in the word ""impossible""."
Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,applejack,"[narrating] He continued to work, knowin' the odds were against him, but determined to push through it. Then, somethin' magical happened."
Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,applejack,[narrating] Rockhoof got visibly stronger! But the lava was getting' closer.
Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,applejack,"[narrating] Through his extraordinary determination and sheer force o' will, Rockhoof more than earned his place in the Mighty Helm."
Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,rainbow dash,"Good story, Applejack! Even if it wasn't about me."
Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,apple bloom,"I love that story, no matter how many times I hear it."
Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,rarity,Why don't we see if it's safe to head back to camp?
Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,sweetie belle,"Uh, girls? There is no camp to go back to."
Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,sweetie belle,All our hard work is ruined!
Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,rarity,"There, there, Sweetie Belle. Not to worry."
Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,sweetie belle,"How? Our camp was so pretty, and this cave is so... not."
Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,rarity,"Oh, no-no-no-no, no, not true. There's beauty in everything. Even these blah rocks aren't really blah. If you look closely, you can see flecks of gold in them. And the way the firelight dances on the cave wall, shadow and light? Ooh, it's so gorgeous! Sweetie Belle, have I ever told you about my favorite legend?"
Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,sweetie belle,No. I didn't know you had one.
Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,rarity,Her name... was Mistmane.
Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,rainbow dash,Mistmane? Isn't she the old wrinkly sorceress with the flower?
Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,rarity,"Yeeees, but did you know she used to be the most beautiful unicorn in all the land?"
Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,rainbow dash,[flatly] No.
Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,cutie mark crusaders,So what happened to her?!
Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,rarity,"Well, Mistmane was a very promising young sorceress."
Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,rarity,[narrating] She was as talented as she was beautiful and kind. Everypony loved her and missed her when she was sent to the finest magic school.
Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,rarity,"[narrating] While she was gone, she was delighted to find out that her best friend, Sable Spirit, was crowned empress. She couldn't wait to return home once she finished her studies."
Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,rarity,"[narrating] But once she arrived, she was devastated by what she saw."
Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,rarity,[narrating] But there was no denying what was in front of her.
Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,rarity,[narrating] Sable Spirit took everything that was beautiful away from anypony else! And Mistmane was sure there had to be some explanation.
Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,sweetie belle,"I'd assume there was, too. If somepony told me either one of you two'd gone evil..."
Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,scootaloo,"Yeah, I'd never believe it."
Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,apple bloom,I dunno. I've seen the way you two get when you miss breakfast.
Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,apple bloom,[chuckles nervously] Just kiddin'. But I'd want answers too.
Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,rarity,So did Mistmane. She went to confront her friend.
Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,rarity,"[narrating] Everypony thought Sable Spirit was defeated, and that was that. But Mistmane knew there was more she could do to help."
Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,rarity,[narrating] Beauty isn't everything. But Mistmane knew that it does have the power to make ponies smile.
Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,rarity,[narrating] She made a huge sacrifice to bring that smile back to her friends' and family's faces... including Sable Spirit's.
Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,rarity,"[narrating] Sable Spirit was so touched that she vowed to be more like her friend in the ways that mattered. From then on, she ruled with kindness and compassion."
Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,rarity,"[narrating] Even though she gave away her physical beauty, she dedicated her life to spreading beauty all over Equestria. Any time you go out of your way to brighten somepony's day by doing something like giving them flowers, you're following in the hoofsteps of Mistmane."
Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,sweetie belle,I think she's my favorite legend too.
Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,rainbow dash,Ugh! These Fly-ders won't quit! What do they want from us now?
Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,applejack,"Well, like it or not, we're food, too."
Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,sweetie belle,And I've got the bites to prove it.
Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,scootaloo,[panicking] What are we gonna do?! They're almost here!
Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,rainbow dash,What?! Now those bugs can't get in!
Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,scootaloo,[hyperventilating] And we can't get out!
Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,applejack,Let's all just stay calm. Let me re-light this fire...
Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,rarity,We just have to wait until the swarm moves on. Then we'll think of a way out.
Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,rainbow dash,"Whoa-whoa-whoa, Scootaloo. You're focusing on the wrong things."
Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,scootaloo,You have a plan?!
Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,rainbow dash,Close. I have a story.
Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,applejack,Lemme guess <U+0096> it's about you?
Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,rainbow dash,"Practically. It's about my favorite legend, Flash Magnus!"
Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,apple bloom,Wasn't he the pony who took on the dragons?
Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,scootaloo,"Dragons?! Big, scary, mean ones or like Spike?"
Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,rainbow dash,"Oh, these were definitely the big, scary, mean kind!"
Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,rainbow dash,But not too scary. You can sit closer to me if you want.
Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,rainbow dash,"A long time ago, before the Wonderbolts were even founded..."
Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,rainbow dash,[narrating] ...Flash Magnus was a lowly cadet in the Royal Legion.
Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,rainbow dash,[narrating] And the Legion needed to fly over the Dragon Lands to get to their comrades on the other side. But as they got closer to the dragons...
Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,rainbow dash,[narrating] ...the dragons attacked!
Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,scootaloo,[shivering] You said this wasn't too scary!
Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,rainbow dash,"[very muffled] Scootaloo, if you just hang in there<U+0097>"
Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,scootaloo,What?
Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,rainbow dash,"I said if you just hang in there, I promise you'll like the ending. So, like I was saying, Flash Magnus and the Royal Legion tried to get past the dragons..."
Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,rainbow dash,[narrating] ...but the dragons wouldn't let them!
Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,rainbow dash,"[narrating] Flash Magnus and a few other cadets were separated from the battalion. He managed to get away, but the dragons captured his friends and took them back to their lair!"
Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,apple bloom,The commander was right. You can't outfight dragons.
Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,rainbow dash,But you can out-think them.
Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,rainbow dash,"[narrating] While Flash Magnus bravely flew for his life, Commander Ironhoof was able to get his soldiers back."
Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,rainbow dash,[narrating] Flash Magnus flew like the wind...
Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,rainbow dash,[narrating] ...faster than the dragons!
Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,rainbow dash,"[narrating] But he knew he couldn't do this forever. Luckily, he had a plan."
Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,rainbow dash,[narrating] He led the dragons straight into a storm that the Legion had planted!
Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,rainbow dash,"[narrating] One taste of the lightning, and the dragons retreated."
Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,rainbow dash,[narrating] Flash Magnus' plan worked!
Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,scootaloo,Wow! I did like that ending.
Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,rainbow dash,Told ya! He always inspired me to be my brave and awesome self.
Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,apple bloom,Mm-hmm!
Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,applejack,"Yeah, I guess he kinda reminds me of you."
Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,rainbow dash,"Tch! You guess? Come on, I'm just like him!"
Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,applejack,"Hey, do you hear that?"
Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,apple bloom,"Uh, I don't hear anythin'."
Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,applejack,Exactly! Those gosh-darn Fly-ders are gone! We can get out!
Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,applejack,Whoa!
Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,rarity,Or not.
Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,applejack,We're gonna have to see if we can get out the other way.
Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,scootaloo,"You mean go further into the dark, spooky cave?!"
Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,rainbow dash,"Scootaloo, just remember the story. Gotta be brave like me and Flash Magnus, okay?"
Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,rainbow dash,I hear water!
Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,rarity,"And if there's flowing water, then..."
Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,applejack,...it might lead to the way out!
Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,cutie mark crusaders,Whoa!
Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,rarity,"Okay, on three. One, two<U+0097>"
Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,apple bloom,Woo-hoo!
Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,sweetie belle,Yeah-ha-ha!
Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,applejack,"Huh. Well, what do you know? We found ourselves a shortcut to Winsome Falls!"
Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,scootaloo,[sighs] It's never looked so beautiful.
Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,rarity,"Well, almost."
Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,applejack,We sure are sorry that our camping trip wasn't what we hoped it would be.
Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,apple bloom,Are you kidding? This trip is awesome!
Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,rarity,It is?
Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,sweetie belle,We got to hear legendary stories and go on an adventure.
Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,applejack,"Wait, you three wanna stay?"
Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,cutie mark crusaders,Of course we do!
Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,sweetie belle,"We could turn those trees into a nice, little shelter!"
Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,apple bloom,We can get you some big logs and branches to help build it!
Campfire Tales,Barry Safchik & Michael Platt,scootaloo,And I bet we could find some more berries! Come on! I can't wait to see what happens next year!
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,starlight glimmer,Ha! Straight to the changeling hive! I told you I could do it.
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,trixie,"Well, not exactly straight, Starlight. We've been popping all around Equestria, and we still have to walk."
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,starlight glimmer,"[scoffs] It's like twelve steps away. Before Chrysalis' throne was destroyed, the closest magic would've gotten us was waaaaaaay over there. On a scale of one to ten, how happy do you think Thorax is gonna be about our surprise visit?"
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,trixie,"Definitely ten. I mean, who wouldn't be happy at the chance to marvel at the overwhelming talent that is the Great and Powerful Trrrrrixie?!"
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,starlight glimmer,"Trixie, we're coming to offer Thorax encouragement and support. His letters make it seem like the responsibilities of being a changeling leader are a little overwhelming."
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,trixie,Yeah. I know. That's basically what I said.
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,starlight glimmer,"He's dealing with the wants and needs of his subjects. Redesigning the hive, a dread maulwurf wreaking havoc outside..."
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,trixie,"It does sound like a lot, but are you sure that last thing is real?"
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,starlight glimmer,"The dread maulwurf? Sure it is. Thorax said it's like half-bear, half-mole, half-raging-pile-of-claws! But now that the changelings don't feed on the love of everything around them, plants have started to grow back. But this maulwurf keeps eating them all up."
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,trixie,"""Maulwurf"". Uh-huh. You're just trying to scare me, but it won't work. Because not only am I the Great and Powerful, I am also the Unscareable Trixie!"
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,trixie,[screams] Please tell me Thorax also mentioned a terrifying-looking changeling who greets visitors but is actually nice!
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,starlight glimmer,[meakly] Nope.
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,trixie,"Starlight, you got us here. I'll take us home. Teleportation spell, go! Did I save us?"
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,starlight glimmer,Nope.
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,trixie,What are you waiting for?! Use some magic to get us outta here!
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,starlight glimmer,"Calm down, ""Unscareable Trixie"". We have to find out what's going on. Thorax might need our help."
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,trixie,"We need our help! Teleportation spell, go! Teleportation spell, go! [gasps] Teleportation spell<U+0097>!"
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,starlight glimmer,Ugh! Why do you keep doing that? You know it doesn't work that way.
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,trixie,"I know, but this is my process."
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,pharynx,I've captured these trespassers!
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,thorax,"Starlight! Trixie! It's okay, Pharynx. You can let them go."
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,pharynx,"But they were lurking on our grounds! In the old days, I would've already feasted on their love."
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,thorax,"Well, that's why they're called the ""old days"", because they're old. We don't do that anymore."
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,pharynx,Dah! I liked the old days better.
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,thorax,"Uh, what are you two doing here?"
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,starlight glimmer,We wanted to surprise you. [sheepishly] Surprise.
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,thorax,"Well, it's great to see you! I'm sorry about the welcome committee."
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,starlight glimmer,I thought Ember helped you get more assertive so you could deal with all the renegade changelings who didn't wanna change.
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,thorax,"Oh, she did. Really helpful. I was able to convince all of them to change, except one of them... My brother."
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,starlight glimmer,Your brother?
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,thorax,Yep. Pharynx is my elder broodmate.
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,starlight glimmer,"Oh, yeah. You guys have the same... um... eye shape?"
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,pharynx,What a ridiculous comparison! We are nothing alike!
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,thorax,Stop doing that!
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,thorax,"Ugh. Well, how about I show you the rest of the hive where it's less loud and bangy?"
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,thorax,"There've been a lot of changes since you were here last. I'm trying to start some new activities since the only thing we did before was hunt and patrol. There's theatre, swing dancing, a once-a-week potluck lunch. Ooh! And who can change shape and organize craft time? Hmm? [transformation noise] This guy!"
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,starlight glimmer,"I am really impressed, Thorax. The hive, all the activities..."
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,thorax,I am so sorry. I promise I'll talk to him.
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,trixie,"Well, maybe not everything here is amazing."
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,starlight glimmer,"Seriously, Thorax. What is up with your brother?"
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,thorax,"Ugh. Pharynx used to be head of patrol. But now we're peaceful and there's no need to patrol, so he just stalks around the hive making everyone miserable. The other changelings are sick of it, and if I can't get him to accept love and friendship and change like the rest of us, everything I've done here is at risk."
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,trixie,Uh-uh.
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,starlight glimmer,[encouragingly] Hmm?
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,trixie,[sighs] Uh-huh.
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,starlight glimmer,We know a thing or two about what it's like to be outsiders. Maybe we could talk to him for you.
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,thorax,Do you really think you can help?
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,trixie,"Thorax, if there's anypony who can help your brother, it's me. And with Starlight helping, it might take slightly longer, but I guarantee you we can do it."
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,thorax,"Oh, I have to head outside. You sure you're okay handling Pharynx?"
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,starlight glimmer,Absolutely.
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,trixie,"So, how do you wanna play this? I'm thinking ""good pony/bad pony"". You yell and blast him with magic while my natural charisma will convince him that<U+0097> uh, Starlight?"
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,starlight glimmer,"Hey, Pharynx. I know when we first met, it didn't go so well."
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,starlight glimmer,"Right. [clears throat] So... not a big fan of the vines, huh?"
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,pharynx,They're a safety hazard. An enemy could hide in them or use them as weapons. I don't even know why they're here.
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,starlight glimmer,Because they're pretty?
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,pharynx,That's ridiculous.
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,starlight glimmer,"Oh, totally. We get you. But... [clears throat] maybe don't express how you feel by destroying them?"
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,pharynx,"I don't take advice from ponies. The only thing I take from you is breakfast. At least, I used to."
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,trixie,"You know, you're a lot like us!"
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,pharynx,Doubt it.
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,trixie,It's true. Do you know who Twilight Sparkle is?
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,pharynx,No.
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,trixie,"Well, she's the most well-liked, studious, do-goodiest pony in Equestria."
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,pharynx,Ugh! She sounds awful.
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,trixie,"Oh, you'd hate her. I used to. She made me unsure about my place in the world, which led me to act out against her."
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,starlight glimmer,And I used to be a dictator who ran a village with an iron hoof.
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,pharynx,Really? Hmm. Maybe you two do understand me.
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,starlight glimmer,"Yes! We do! But now, Trixie has come to terms with being second-best, and I no longer control ponies against their will. And our lives are so much better for it."
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,pharynx,"Wow. So you're both losers. Stay away from me, or I'll do to you what I did to the vines."
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,thorax,"Well, ""Operation: Lead Maulwurf Away"" is coming along. How'd it go with Pharynx?"
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,starlight glimmer,"Your brother is, um, challenging."
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,thorax,"Oh, that bad, huh?"
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,starlight glimmer,It wasn't great.
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,thorax,You wanna talk it out? You can come with me to the feelings forum.
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,trixie,The feel-like-what-now?
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,thorax,"Oh, it's a place for changelings to express their feelings so we all gain a better understanding of each other. It's really helped bring the hive closer together."
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,thorax,"Everyone, please! I understand Pharynx can be challenging at times."
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,pharynx,"It sounds like your lame ""feelings forum"" is for talking about me behind my back!"
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,pharynx,"Actually, there is. The changelings used to be a fearsome swarm! Now we sit around talking about our feelings so much, you can't even stop a maulwurf from eating all your ""pretty plants""! I could've sent that thing packing before, but I guess now we'll just try to lead it away and hope that keeps us safe!"
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,thorax,I can't do that.
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,starlight glimmer,"I... [sighs] I want to say something, but it goes against everything I've been taught as Twilight's pupil."
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,trixie,"Ooh! Then, by all means, say it."
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,starlight glimmer,[sighs] I think Pharynx is a lost cause.
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,trixie,"Mm. I'm all for second chances. Third, even. But he just seems like a bad bug."
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,starlight glimmer,"And Thorax has a duty to the whole hive, not just his brother."
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,trixie,"If he keeps sticking up for Pharynx, the hive might decide they don't want Thorax as their leader."
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,starlight glimmer,I think he might have to kick Pharynx out. But I don't wanna be the one to tell Thorax that.
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,trixie,"Me, neither. But somepony probably should. I nominate you!"
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,starlight glimmer,Ugh!
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,starlight glimmer,"Thorax, we have something to tell you."
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,thorax,"It's about Pharynx, isn't it?"
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,trixie,[hesitating] Mmmmmmmaybe?
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,thorax,"Look, I know he's an aggressive warrior type, but when I was little, every young changeling wanted to be like that."
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,thorax,[voiceover] ...Every young changeling except me. The others would pick on me for not wanting to fight.
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,thorax,[voiceover] But Pharynx never let them hurt me.
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,trixie,"Aw, that was a really sweet story. Until the end."
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,thorax,"I know Pharynx loved me in his own way, and I know there's still good in him. That's why I keep sticking up for him. Anyway, what did you wanna talk to me about?"
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,trixie,"Me? Oh, noooo. But, uh, Starlight has something she<U+0097>"
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,starlight glimmer,"Actually, Thorax, um, never mind! C'mon, Trixie, we've got a... thing to do."
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,trixie,[whispering] What are you doing? I thought we agreed you'd tell Thorax he had to kick his brother out of the hive!
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,starlight glimmer,Maybe we don't have to. Get Pharynx and meet me at the hive entrance. I'll explain everything.
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,trixie,And how am I supposed to know where Pharynx is?!
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,trixie,"Oh! Well, that was easy."
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,trixie,Wow.
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,starlight glimmer,"I know, right? Great idea? Where's Pharynx?"
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,trixie,He's gone.
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,starlight glimmer,Gone like gone to the throne room?
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,trixie,Gone like gone! One of the changelings said Pharynx left the hive for good!
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,starlight glimmer,[gasp] Then who's gonna stop the dread maulwurf I'm leading here?!
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,starlight glimmer,"[panting] Thorax, there you are! Pharynx is missing!"
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,trixie,Wait for it...
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,starlight glimmer,And the dread maulwurf is coming this way!
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,trixie,Told ya.
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,thorax,That doesn't make any sense. The trail of plants should have led the dread maulwurf away.
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,starlight glimmer,[nervous laugh] I might have relaid them to lead it back toward the hive.
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,thorax,Why would you do that?!
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,starlight glimmer,"I thought if Pharynx saw you were in danger, the loving, caring side of him would come out when he protected you!"
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,thorax,"But instead, he's out there alone somewhere between us and that rampaging monster?! I have to save him!"
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,starlight glimmer,I'm coming with you!
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,thorax,Of course you are! This is all your fault!
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,trixie,"[condescending] Oh, don't be too hard on Starlight. Her heart was in the right place."
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,thorax,"You're coming, too!"
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,trixie,"Oh. Right. I mean, I was gonna volunteer anyway..."
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,thorax,Who else is coming?
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,thorax,[groans] Fine.
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,starlight glimmer,"Oh, sure, you could all stay here, not help Pharynx and he won't bother you anymore. It's your choice. But remember when you didn't have a choice! When you were forced to obey Chrysalis! You might have been unstoppable, but you weren't free to choose! And now you are, because of Thorax! Well, it's his brother out there, and now it's your chance to prove you're just as strong embracing love as you were feeding on it! Now is your chance to show what changelings can really be! Not because you have to, but because you choose to!"
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,trixie,"That was an amazingly epic speech, Starlight! I just can't believe not a single changeling was moved by it."
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,thorax,"I can't blame them. If he wasn't my brother, I don't think I'd be here. We're gonna have to face the maulwurf by ourselves."
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,starlight glimmer,Maybe it'll be long gone and we'll find Pharynx out here alone!
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,starlight glimmer,Or maybe not.
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,thorax,Pharynx!
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,pharynx,What are you doing here?!
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,thorax,I'm here to save you!
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,pharynx,Get outta here! Let me handle this!
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,starlight glimmer,We're not leaving you!
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,thorax,[nervous] I may have forgotten to mention in my letters that maulwurfs have really thick hides!
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,starlight glimmer,I thought you said you could beat this thing!
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,pharynx,"Yeah, with the rest of the swarm! Not alone!"
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,trixie,I told you it was an epic speech.
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,thorax,It's no use! We're out of practice and he's too tough!
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,trixie,And strong! Too bad we can't get it to fight itself!
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,pharynx,"That's it! Thorax, remember when we were young and I made you hit yourself?"
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,thorax,"Now is not the time to make fun of me, Pharynx!"
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,thorax,"Oh, right! Of course!"
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,pharynx,Why are you hitting yourself? Why are you hitting yourself? Why are you hitting yourself?!
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,thorax,"Yeah, maulwurf, why are you hitting yourself?"
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,thorax,"Why are you hitting yourself, huh? Huh? Huh?"
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,trixie,"Ooh, that looks like it hurts."
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,starlight glimmer,We did it! It's gone!
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,thorax,What were you doing out here?
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,pharynx,Leaving. I'm done with all of you.
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,thorax,"Oh. It's just, why bother fighting the maulwurf then? You coulda left it alone."
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,pharynx,"Well, I couldn't just let it attack you!"
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,thorax,"But I thought you were done with us, and you didn't care."
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,pharynx,I never said that. The hive is the thing I care about most.
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,thorax,"Well, you certainly don't act like it."
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,pharynx,"Well, I'm sorry if I don't get excited about pretty flowers and feeling circles and<U+0097>"
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,thorax,It's a feelings forum.
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,pharynx,"Whatever. It doesn't matter. Even if I do care about the hive, I obviously don't have a place there anymore."
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,thorax,And who better to help us do that than the only changeling who never stopped protecting us?
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,pharynx,You all want me to stay?
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,thorax,Unless you still want to leave the hive.
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,pharynx,Why would I want that? I love the hive!
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,trixie,He did it! He transformed!
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,starlight glimmer,I always knew you had it in you!
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,pharynx,Really? Because I thought you said I was a lost cause and you were going to tell Thorax he should kick me out.
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,trixie,Oh! Starlight! How could you say that?
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,starlight glimmer,Ugh! What?! That's<U+0097>! I mean<U+0097>! But you<U+0097>!
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,thorax,"Lucky for us, you weren't a lost cause."
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,pharynx,"Lucky for me, you didn't give up on me."
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,trixie,Soooo... glad everything worked out.
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,thorax,Yeah! Let's talk about how you not only led the maulwurf to the hive but also drove my brother away from it!
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,pharynx,Hey. Do you guys want to hear the story about how I used to make Thorax hit himself?
To Change a Changeling,Kevin Lappin,starlight glimmer,"[relieved] Oh, absolutely, yes, right now!"
Daring Done?,Gillian M. Berrow,pinkie pie,"Fan-tizzy-astic! I just love to read about happy happenings, and it's always good to be a pony in the know, you know? And there's so much to know!"
Daring Done?,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,"Eh, seems like a bunch of boring hooey to me."
Daring Done?,Gillian M. Berrow,pinkie pie,"Does ""New Shrubbery In Castle Garden"" sound like boring hooey to you?"
Daring Done?,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,Snooze.
Daring Done?,Gillian M. Berrow,pinkie pie,"What about... ""Parasprite Infestation In Fillydelphia Eradicated""? Ah! That's great news!"
Daring Done?,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,"Eh. Another day, another parasprite hype story."
Daring Done?,Gillian M. Berrow,pinkie pie,"[reading] ""Noodles Named Official Food Of Whinnyapolis"". ""Author A. K. Yearling Announces Retirement"". ""Cloudsdale Election Heating Up For Candidate In Favor Of Cooling It Down""."
Daring Done?,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,What?! Let me see that!
Daring Done?,Gillian M. Berrow,pinkie pie,"I never knew you were so into politics, Rainbow."
Daring Done?,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,"No, this! It can't be true..."
Daring Done?,Gillian M. Berrow,pinkie pie,"I'd have never have picked noodles as the official food of Whinnyapolis either, but here we are."
Daring Done?,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,"No, Pinkie! I can't believe that the greatest author and secret pony adventurer of all time, A. K. Yearling... is retiring!"
Daring Done?,Gillian M. Berrow,pinkie pie,"A. K. Yearling just retired. Like, today. Are you sure she wants visitors?"
Daring Done?,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,"Pinkie, the A. K. Yearling I know would never quit and retire out of the blue! Something could be really wrong, and we need to make sure she's okay!"
Daring Done?,Gillian M. Berrow,pinkie pie,"Okay! Heeeey... You're not just trying to make sure she writes more Daring Do books, are you?"
Daring Done?,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,"Of course not! But that wouldn't hurt either. Now, come on!"
Daring Done?,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,"Uh, maybe she's not home. Maybe she went to the editor-in-chief of the Ponyville Chronicle to correct the misprint they've made."
Daring Done?,Gillian M. Berrow,pinkie pie,Nope. She's home.
Daring Done?,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,How do you know?
Daring Done?,Gillian M. Berrow,pinkie pie,Because she's right there looking all sad and alone.
Daring Done?,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,[gasps] I knew it! Something is wrong! [knocking rapidly] A. K!
Daring Done?,Gillian M. Berrow,pinkie pie,"Now she's sighing with the weight of the world. Now she's hanging her head in utter despair. Now she's shaking her hoof and cursing the heavens like nothing could ever possibly be the same again. Why, oh, why did this happen to her?!"
Daring Done?,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,What?!
Daring Done?,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,"A. K., it's us! Rainbow Dash and Pinkie Pie! Your friends!"
Daring Done?,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,"Oh, no. Did somepony ransack your cottage again and steal some ancient, mysterious relic that's the key to saving all of Equestria?!"
Daring Done?,Gillian M. Berrow,pinkie pie,Oooh! Sparky!
Daring Done?,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,Then is somepony blackmailing you and forcing you to retire? Cause if they are...!
Daring Done?,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,So you're just quitting and moving away? Why... would... you... do... that?!
Daring Done?,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,"Oh, really? [reading] ""Author A. K. Yearling announced yesterday that the next adventure novel in her popular series, 'Daring Do and the Curse of the Pharaoh's Tomb', will be her last. Yearling looks forward to her retirement."" That doesn't explain anything!"
Daring Done?,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,"It just says you're giving up writing stories. But most ponies don't know that you actually are Daring Do and that the stories are real. So what you're really saying is that you're giving up being Daring Do, but you're not saying why!"
Daring Done?,Gillian M. Berrow,pinkie pie,"Of course, if you don't feel like talking about it, that's A-okay, A. K.! As your friends, we completely understand. Right, Rainbow Dash?"
Daring Done?,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,Oh. Yeah. We just came to make sure you're all right. That's really why we wanted to find out what's going on.
Daring Done?,Gillian M. Berrow,pinkie pie,"[reading] ""Wake Of Destruction: Daring Do Ruins Entire Village Marketplace!"""
Daring Done?,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,"[reading] ""Dare Or Scare: Local Rogue Daring Do Involved In Frightful Fiasco""?"
Daring Done?,Gillian M. Berrow,pinkie pie,"[reading] ""Daring Do Leads Bull Into China Shop During High-Speed Chase<U+0097>"""
Daring Done?,Gillian M. Berrow,pinkie pie,That's not true. They're not mad at A. K. Yearling. They're mad at Daring Do.
Daring Done?,Gillian M. Berrow,pinkie pie,Then I guess it's a good thing you look so different as A. K. Yearling!
Daring Done?,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,So all we have to do is go down there and explain to these ponies that none of this stuff is true.
Daring Done?,Gillian M. Berrow,pinkie pie,Easy-peasy-cheesy!
Daring Done?,Gillian M. Berrow,pinkie pie,Then you are in a tricky pickle. But why is all this happening now?
Daring Done?,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,"Come on! For every one pony who's upset, there must be at least a hundred that know you're a hero!"
Daring Done?,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,"Well, why don't we go visit this village ""Som...nam...bu...la"" and see for ourselves?"
Daring Done?,Gillian M. Berrow,pinkie pie,"But if we go there, the ponies can tell you in person just how much they appreciate you."
Daring Done?,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,And what a heap of rotten apple cores these articles are!
Daring Done?,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,I know so! Let's go!
Daring Done?,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,[squealing] This is so cool! It looks just like that village in your last book where Daring Do recovers the Doomed Diadem from the Wild Bunch Gang who chase after her through the desert!
Daring Done?,Gillian M. Berrow,pinkie pie,"What happens? No, wait, don't tell me. I changed my mind! Tell me!"
Daring Done?,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,"Daring Do thwarts Ahuizotl's evil plot to separate the Sister Crown Relics. And if it wasn't for her, the region would be cursed with eternal night, and the entire town of Somnambula would have sunk into the ground!"
Daring Done?,Gillian M. Berrow,pinkie pie,"Ah, puh! There's no chance that these ponies don't think you're a hero."
Daring Done?,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,"Watch this. [to ""Cortland""] Hiya there, mister! I was hoping you could tell me about a pony named Daring Do. I hear she's an awesome adventure-pony hero."
Daring Done?,Gillian M. Berrow,dr. caballeron,Dr. Indeed. Daring Do is a menace who destroys everything she touches!
Daring Done?,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,What?! No! Daring Do is the exact opposite of a menace!
Daring Done?,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,"Come on, A. K.! So we picked a bad example. That was just one angry pony."
Daring Done?,Gillian M. Berrow,pinkie pie,Two angry ponies!
Daring Done?,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,Come on! We gotta follow her!
Daring Done?,Gillian M. Berrow,pinkie pie,I dunno. It really seemed like she doesn't want us cramping her saddle.
Daring Done?,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,"But we have to convince her that ponies do appreciate her! As her friend, I have to make sure she believes that."
Daring Done?,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,"Look, Pinkie! It's the Get On Inn! Daring Do stays here all the time in her adventures. Which means there must be ponies here who love Daring Do! Maybe they can help us."
Daring Done?,Gillian M. Berrow,pinkie pie,[sniffing] Mmmmm. My nose is telling me to help myself to muffins.
Daring Done?,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,Come on...
Daring Done?,Gillian M. Berrow,pinkie pie,"Ooh, she's fancy. I got this. [to Mrs. Trotsworth] A good evening to you, madame. We are but weary travelers who humbly wish to inquire on the status of a certain mare of intrigue taking residence here."
Daring Done?,Gillian M. Berrow,pinkie pie,Is it true that Daring Do stays here?
Daring Done?,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,Why not?
Daring Done?,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,But<U+0097>
Daring Done?,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,"No, no, no. You've got it all wrong."
Daring Done?,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,Daring Do was trying to save everypony from the curse of the Doomed Diadem of Xilati. And she was only in a rush because she had to get the crown back to the Tiara of Teotlale before the curse took effect. [to Pinkie Pie] Chapter seventeen.
Daring Done?,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,Hmmm...
Daring Done?,Gillian M. Berrow,dr. caballeron,"Dr. Daring Do ruined our town and stole our precious glowpaz! We need to make sure that if she turns up again, there will be consequences! Everypony who's with me, meet at the statue tomorrow!"
Daring Done?,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,"Listen, A. K. After a good night's sleep, we're going to fix all of this. I promise."
Daring Done?,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,Of course it will! All I have to do is go up there and explain to everypony how wrong they all are.
Daring Done?,Gillian M. Berrow,pinkie pie,"Yeah! And then I'll be like, ""What she said!"""
Daring Done?,Gillian M. Berrow,pinkie pie,Exactly!
Daring Done?,Gillian M. Berrow,dr. caballeron,"Dr. Here it is! The remains of your<U+0096> I mean, our Somnambula statue! Now that Daring Do has destroyed it, tell me, where will we hang our glowpaz?"
Daring Done?,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,"Daring Do would never steal anything! And okay, she destroyed your statue, but it was because she was trying to save you all from Ahuizotl!"
Daring Done?,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,Ahuizotl? He's about yea big? Long neck? Itty-bitty face? Weird claw thingy on his tail?
Daring Done?,Gillian M. Berrow,pinkie pie,Ooh! Ooh! I know him! He's a baddie!
Daring Done?,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,"Trust me, if Ahuizotl had gotten away with the Doomed Diadem, your entire village would have been swallowed up! And that's a lot worse than losing some crummy old statue!"
Daring Done?,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,Who?
Daring Done?,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,"Wow. I had no idea how special the statue was to you. Somnambula sounds like a pretty cool pony. But I bet if she were here, she'd tell you how cool Daring Do is too, because they've both fought to protect this town!"
Daring Done?,Gillian M. Berrow,dr. caballeron,"Dr. If Somnambula were here today, she would condemn Daring Do for destroying your<U+0096> our symbol of hope!"
Daring Done?,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,"Hey, buddy! What did Daring Do ever do to you to deserve all this?!"
Daring Done?,Gillian M. Berrow,dr. caballeron,Dr. Only... everything!
Daring Done?,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,Dr. Caballeron?!
Daring Done?,Gillian M. Berrow,dr. caballeron,"Dr. Yes... Rainbow Dash. [laughing evilly] When I saw you, her closest friend, I knew that Daring Do would not be far behind. I really do owe you for leading her right to me."
Daring Done?,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,But I-I didn't mean to<U+0097>
Daring Done?,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,Help!
Daring Done?,Gillian M. Berrow,pinkie pie,He's got Rainbow Dash! Come on!
Daring Done?,Gillian M. Berrow,pinkie pie,[panting] I'm... coming... Rainbow... Dash... [to Daring Do] Ah! I knew you'd come!
Daring Done?,Gillian M. Berrow,daring do,You did? I sure didn't. What if I cause more trouble?
Daring Done?,Gillian M. Berrow,pinkie pie,You won't.
Daring Done?,Gillian M. Berrow,daring do,How do you know?
Daring Done?,Gillian M. Berrow,pinkie pie,I just do! You wouldn't let anything happen to Rainbow Dash. You care too much.
Daring Done?,Gillian M. Berrow,daring do,You're right. Which way did they go? To the pyramid!
Daring Done?,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,Somepony help! Somepony! Anypony! Pinkie Pie?! Daring Do?! Is that you?!
Daring Done?,Gillian M. Berrow,pinkie pie,"Don't worry, Rainbow! We'll save you!"
Daring Done?,Gillian M. Berrow,daring do,[grunting] He's right! We'll never get to her in time!
Daring Done?,Gillian M. Berrow,pinkie pie,"If this really is like Somnambula's story, then we just have to have hope that we can."
Daring Done?,Gillian M. Berrow,daring do,"I think we need more than hope, Pinkie. There was a bridge in the story, and there's no bridge here. What are we going to do?"
Daring Done?,Gillian M. Berrow,daring do,Pinkie!
Daring Done?,Gillian M. Berrow,daring do,Aha!
Daring Done?,Gillian M. Berrow,pinkie pie,Wheeee! [giggles] I knew we'd do it!
Daring Done?,Gillian M. Berrow,daring do,"Thanks for reminding me to never give up hope, Pinkie."
Daring Done?,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,"And I'm kinda ""hoping"" you ponies will untie me before we all take a bath in bubbling green slime!"
Daring Done?,Gillian M. Berrow,daring do,We're on it!
Daring Done?,Gillian M. Berrow,daring do,"Not so fast, Caballeron!"
Daring Done?,Gillian M. Berrow,daring do,I should have known you were just trying to sully my name so that you'd be free to steal whatever you wanted.
Daring Done?,Gillian M. Berrow,dr. caballeron,"Dr. And with the destruction you leave in your wake, it didn't take too much to convince ponies you were a villain!"
Daring Done?,Gillian M. Berrow,daring do,"You're wrong, Caballeron. And I won't let you break my spirit again. Because I'm never going to give up hope that I can protect ponies and ancient treasures from miscreants like you!"
Daring Done?,Gillian M. Berrow,dr. caballeron,"Dr. R-Remember! She ruined your statue! You're fools to believe in her! [growls] You'll pay for this, Daring Do!"
Daring Done?,Gillian M. Berrow,daring do,"Okay, okay, that's enough. [to Rainbow Dash and Pinkie Pie] Thanks for helping me come to my senses. You two are true friends."
Daring Done?,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,Are you kidding? That... was... awesome!
Daring Done?,Gillian M. Berrow,pinkie pie,We're just glad you're back to your old self again.
Daring Done?,Gillian M. Berrow,daring do,"[chuckles] Me too. But I'm glad I realized that even if you're fighting for something good, you're still responsible for your actions."
Daring Done?,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,"And if something bad happens that you didn't intend, you shouldn't give up hope or lose faith in yourself."
Daring Done?,Gillian M. Berrow,pinkie pie,Yeah! All you gotta do is make it right. Feel free to use that in your next book!
Daring Done?,Gillian M. Berrow,daring do,"You know, I think I will."
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,filthy rich,Hmph! Looks like I'm not the only one who left Mares Day to the last minute.
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,sweetie drops,There's just so many! How can I choose?!
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,sweetie drops,How?!
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,rarity,What I would do...
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,rarity,...is pick flowers that accentuate my mane. It makes for a captivating color story when you present them to whomever they're intended.
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,rarity,"Oh, darling, I need a dozen lavender pieces for Photo Finish's shoot on the most beautiful manes in Equestria."
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,rarity,"I know you're swamped, but it's for Vanity Mare! She's going to take pictures of my mane, so color coordination is a must."
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,rarity,"Have you a single big one? If the wind came from one direction, it would really intensify the effect."
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,rarity,"Hmm. I do enjoy the windswept look, but other ponies might need to see it before they feel it."
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,rarity,"Pinkie? I need to put Photo Finish in a good mood, and nothing creates a better mood than your confecti<U+0097> Ooh. Am I interrupting?"
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,pinkie pie,We were just celebrating the anniversary of the twins' first sneezes! [giggles] [clears throat] Just about one year ago There was a tickle in your nose You snorted through the nursery [snorts] Happy Sneeze-iversary!
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,rarity,[deadpan] Congratulations.
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,rarity,[shrieks] Pinkie! I can't have Photo Finish shoot my mane like this! And this party string won't come off!
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,pinkie pie,"Oh, that's because it's not just party string. It's super-sticky celebration string!"
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,rarity,"[shuddering sigh] It'll be fine, Pinkie. I'll find a way to clean this up before the shoot tomorrow. [whimper] Actually, you might consider doing the same."
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,pinkie pie,"[grunting, straining] If only we had some kind of super-sudsy mane conditioning shampoo for you and a magical cleaning remover potion for me."
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,rarity,[gasps] That's it! We'll pay a visit to Zecora! She's a wonder with a cauldron. I'm sure she can mix up a fix for both of us.
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,pinkie pie,"That's good, because it would take forever to yank all of those baked goods out of the super-sticky celebration string."
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,rarity,I... think you may still have some baking to do.
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,rarity,I do wish Zecora lived in town. One shouldn't have to brave the darkest part of the forest for shampoo.
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,pinkie pie,Do you think Photo Finish would want to take a picture of my mane?
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,rarity,"Well, uh... Hmm...I'm not sure that your style is quite right for this particular photo essay. Photo Finish travelled everywhere in her search for the most beautiful of manes."
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,pinkie pie,Even Yakyakistan?
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,rarity,"Well, yaks don't have manes, per se, and I'm not sure their style is quite what she's looking for either."
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,rarity,"Though at this moment, neither is mine."
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,pinkie pie,Don't worry! Zecora will abso-tively be able to help!
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,rarity,I'm sure you're right.
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,rarity,"Listen, spooky eyes! Why don't you take a picture?! It will last longer!"
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,rarity,"On second thought, don't. Getting my picture taken in this state is what I'm trying to avoid!"
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,rarity,Are you certain that's safe?
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,zecora,"I'm sure they seem strange, but my methods are mine. After all, I've been doing this for quite a long time."
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,pinkie pie,I'll have those cupcakes cleaned off in no time!
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,rarity,You really should bake new ones.
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,pinkie pie,Nah!
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,zecora,"For your mane, of course, just soap will do, so use my super-sudsy shampoo."
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,zecora,"You were right to be concerned. Manes are tricky, I have learned."
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,rarity,Oh! [scoffs] Tell me about it!
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,zecora,"Cleaning is simple, but a magical fix could cause any number of troublesome ticks."
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,pinkie pie,Really?
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,zecora,"Oh, there are tales I could tell to make your hair stand on end. Horrifying, terrifying attempts to mane-mend!"
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,rarity,"Well, I do enjoy a good yarn, but I'm not sure I could take anymore mane fright today."
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,zecora,"There's the contagious frizz that spreads friend to friend, or the story of the infinitely splitting end!"
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,rarity,"Uh-huh, hmm, yes, well, very entertaining. Uh, thanks for the shampoo. Ta-ta!"
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,pinkie pie,Anything about curls that keep on curling until your whole body is one big curl?
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,zecora,[laughs] There is one story I nearly forgot: of an Earth pony who needed to clean up her shop.
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,pinkie pie,"Wow! That's just what I have to do! Huh, weird."
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,zecora,Perhaps it'd be better if I were more clear. You can't clean up Sugarcube Corner from here.
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,pinkie pie,"Geez, Zecora, I can take a hint."
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,zecora,"With just a few drops, any mess you'll improve if you focus on that which you want to remove."
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,pinkie pie,It won't be hard to focus on the super-sticky celebration string. It's kinda the only thing you can see.
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,pinkie pie,"Zecora says it would only take a few drops, but I figured we should all chip in. Just in case! Remember to only focus on the party string. We don't wanna accidentally remove anything else."
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,rarity,"It's important that you know that I am not pointing hooves, but<U+0097>"
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,zecora,"I don't understand. Is that you, Rarity? Why would you think to point your hooves at me?"
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,rarity,Let's just say I understand why your shampoo hasn't made a splash in the marketplace.
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,rarity,"Goodness, Zecora! You could at least pretend it isn't that bad!"
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,zecora,"I'm sorry, my dear, but there is nothing to say. You just took the wrong potion from here yesterday."
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,rarity,"Oh, thank goodness! I thought maybe your shampoo had triggered early-onset mare pattern baldness!"
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,zecora,"No, this lack of hair was put into motion when you mistakenly washed with remover potion."
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,rarity,"[laughing] Oh, what a relief! Well, if you could just whip up a cure, I'll be on my way. So much to do before the shoot tomorrow."
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,zecora,"As I mentioned before, there's no easy fix. Mane-mending magic's the trickiest of tricks."
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,rarity,[mumbling] Sorry?
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,zecora,"I doubt that your mane has left us forever. There is a chance we can fix it, I think, if we're clever."
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,rarity,"W-w-w-w-w-w-wait, there's, there's a chance?! You think?!"
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,zecora,I need to focus if I'm to work any faster. One wrong ingredient spells utter disaster. You should go finish your list of to-dos. Keep your mind off of all of these mane-losing blues.
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,rarity,[exhales] There's nothing to worry about. Zecora will have a cure before I've even finished my to-dos. But I don't know if I can even show my face looking like this!
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,rarity,"Uh, sorry. I, uh, believe it was my turn, and I-I-I-I just need to pick up some<U+0097>"
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,rarity,"Oh, so kind of you to say. I-I<U+0097>"
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,rarity,N-Non-fabulous?!
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,rarity,"Oh, thank you, Davenport. Um, perhaps I can pick it up once everypony leav<U+0097>"
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,rarity,But<U+0097> But<U+0097> I<U+0097> I<U+0097>
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,rarity,I can't believe how differently ponies treat you when you can't command their attention.
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,Are you sure that's what happened?
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,Wait. You can't command ponies' attention because your mane's messed up?
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,rarity,"""Messed up""? Does this look ""messed up"" to you?!"
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,rarity,Honestly! How hard is it to pretend it's not so bad?
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,Hard.
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,rarity,"If today is any indication of how ponies will treat me from now on, I can't simply wait to see if my mane grows back!"
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"I'm sorry, Rarity. I'm sure nopony means to make you feel worse than you already do."
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,Didn't you say Zecora was working on a cure?
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,rarity,"Yes, well, even if everypony isn't utterly indifferent to my presence, Zecora might not be able to fix this in time for the shoot. Can't you do a spell to restore some semblance of my mane?!"
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,"The thing is, it's pretty much like Zecora said. Fixing manes with magic is<U+0097>"
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,rarity,Tricky! I know! I don't care! Make with the tricks!
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,Huh?
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,rarity,This won't do! I need an actual mane!
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,But it has to come from somewhere.
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"Oh, you can't just make a mane with magic. The results could be disastrous."
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,rarity,More disastrous than this?!
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,[sighs] I don't think there's anything else we can try.
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,rarity,[panicked stuttering] B-But Zecora said there was still a chance!
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,zecora,"At last, Rarity, I have searched for so long! What I told you before was totally wrong!"
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"Zecora, you found a cure? That's amazing!"
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,rarity,[sighs in relief] You mean I'll get my fabulous mane back in time for the shoot?
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,zecora,"Oh, no. I'm afraid I can't fix it before the big shoot. But in time, the hair will grow back from the root. There's no magical cure to hasten us through it, unless you went backward in time to undo it."
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,Uh-uh. I think we can both say that's not a good option.
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,rarity,I have always believed that the right outfit can make up for any other areas that are lacking. But I will need your honest opinions. [nervous ta-da] How awful is it?
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,rarity,"Oh, come on! Can't anypony pretend it's not bad?!"
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,fluttershy,"We could, um, try."
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,rainbow dash,Maybe...?
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,rarity,"Well, if any of you have an idea how to make this disaster look good enough for Photo Finish's piece in Vanity Mare on the most beautiful manes in Equestria, [sobbing] I'm open to hearing it!"
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,applejack,Is that all?
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,rainbow dash,No problem!
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,rarity,Hm?
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,rarity,"I don't understand, Applejack. How is milking a cow going to help?"
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,applejack,That's just it. It looks like we hired a new milkmaid...
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,granny smith,This is pretty close to my color as a young'un!
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,applejack,Just a little down-home ingenuity.
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,rarity,"It's a good idea, Applejack, but Photo Finish is looking for the most beautiful manes, not bonnets."
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,rainbow dash,This'll do the trick. Just you wait!
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,rarity,"[gasps] You know, this is really quite fetching!"
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,rainbow dash,Yes! Nailed it!
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,rarity,...Just not portable.
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,fluttershy,There!
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,rarity,"Oh, let's face it. I'll just have to call Photo Finish and cancel."
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"I think we all know how bad Rarity's been feeling, but I never thought she'd cancel her shoot with Photo Finish."
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,rainbow dash,"You saw her mane, right?"
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,applejack,"But it's Rarity. If anypony can turn lemons into lemonade, it's her."
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,fluttershy,I guess it's harder for her when she feels like the lemon.
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"Well, she's not a lemon <U+0096> she's our friend. And right now, she needs our support."
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,rarity,[muffled] Come in.
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,rarity,Would you mind closing the door? I'm more comfortable in the dark.
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,applejack,"Okay, Rarity, you've done just about enough sulkin'! Havin' a fabulous mane is a wonderful thing, but it ain't the only thing!"
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,rainbow dash,"Yeah! And we're here to remind you how awesome you are, mane or no mane!"
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,rarity,"[sighs] It's lovely of you to say, but it's hard to argue with cold, hard facts."
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,fluttershy,What facts are those?
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,rarity,"That without my mane, I simply can't shine as I once did, and ponies treat me like the sad, invisible pony I've become."
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"Rarity, you're not invisible. You're our friend. A friend that started a fashion empire."
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,fluttershy,A friend who made us all feel beautiful in her lovely creations.
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,rainbow dash,"A friend who stuck by us, no matter what!"
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,applejack,A friend so generous that she once chopped off her own tail to help a sea serpent.
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"I know you lost some confidence when you lost your mane, but unlike your hair, confidence is something you can get back right now."
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,rarity,"Goodness... You're right! The only pony behaving differently today was me! Besides, what doesn't shine from the outside in..."
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,"Um, Rarity, what are you doing?"
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,rarity,I'm preparing to shine from the inside out!
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,rainbow dash,Awesome!
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,filthy rich,It's my own fault. I shouldn't have bought flowers without asking Spoiled what she likes.
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,filthy rich,"Um, uh... purple?"
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,rarity,I have a solution!
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,rarity,"Thank you. Although I'm afraid I missed my chance at Vanity Mare, which means I have quite a few lavender arrangements to spare."
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,filthy rich,"Uh, is lavender purple?"
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,rarity,Mm... The windswept look is very last-season. Perhaps you could set this up outside. It's sure to draw in the hoof traffic.
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,rarity,"Photoshoot or no, you can always use a chaise!"
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,applejack,"Well, Rarity, if you wanted to shine from the inside out, I think this afternoon, you became the brightest filly in Equestria!"
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,rarity,"Oh, pshaw, Applejack. I'm simply making up for all the time I wasted feeling sorry for myself."
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,rainbow dash,I don't know why you were so upset. Your mane looks awesome!
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,rarity,"I'm just glad I have all of you to remind me that even if I accidentally use magical remover potion on my mane, I can look good on the outside as long as I feel good on the inside."
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"How'd you end up using remover potion on your head, anyway?"
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,rarity,[gasps] Pinkie!
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,rarity,"If I had the remover potion this whole time, that means Pinkie must have the<U+0097>"
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,rarity,...shampoo.
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,pinkie pie,Shampoo? Wow! That explains why our manes are all so bouncy and soft!
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,rarity,"Uh, perhaps I'll fetch the rest of that remover potion."
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,pinkie pie,"Great! Hey, is there something different about you? New hoof polish?"
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,rarity,So you're sure? You're sure it's fully recovered?
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,applejack,"Yes, Rarity. It's been months. Your mane looks fine."
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,pinkie pie,"Oooh, look! It's the ""Most Beautiful Manes in Equestria"" issue of Vanity Mare! You should read it."
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,rarity,"Oh, honestly, Pinkie? After all I went through, I'm not sure it even matters what mane graces the page<U+0097>"
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,pinkie pie,Read it!
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,rarity,But I... I cancelled the shoot.
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,applejack,We had a little talk with Photo Finish.
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,fluttershy,And explained just how beautiful we thought you were. Inside and out.
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,rainbow dash,"While you were shining from the inside out, Photo Finish took a few pictures."
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,rarity,I don't know what to say!
It Isn't the Mane Thing About You,Josh Haber,applejack,"Luckily, you don't have to say anything. Your style speaks for itself."
A Health of Information,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,fluttershy,"Thank you so much, Zecora. I never would've found the crisscross moss without you."
A Health of Information,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,zecora,"Of course. I know where it grows, so it's not much to ask. Though retrieving it has been a difficult task."
A Health of Information,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,fluttershy,"Oh, but the oxen visiting Sweet Feather Sanctuary next week will surely appreciate it. It really adds a shine to their coat."
A Health of Information,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,zecora,"There we go. Now, that wasn't so tough. Fluttershy, tell me, will this be enough?"
A Health of Information,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,fluttershy,"Gee, I don't know. It's a pretty big pack. So maybe enough to fill up this sack? [gasps, laughs] Oh, my! You're rubbing off on me, Zecora!"
A Health of Information,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,zecora,Whoa. Whoa!
A Health of Information,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,fluttershy,"[screams] Oh, no, oh, no, oh, no!"
A Health of Information,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,fluttershy,"Zecora, are you all right?"
A Health of Information,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,zecora,No need to fret. I only got wet. At least now I can easily grab all the crisscross moss there is to be had.
A Health of Information,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,fluttershy,[gasps] What's happening to you?
A Health of Information,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,zecora,"Honestly, it's hard to tell. But suddenly, I don't feel so well..."
A Health of Information,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,fluttershy,"Do you think it's serious, doctor?"
A Health of Information,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,fluttershy,I can't believe a flower did this. I take back thinking it was pretty!
A Health of Information,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,zecora,"Tell me, doctor. What should I do? I've never heard of Swamp Fever, mind you."
A Health of Information,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,zecora,Oh! Is there anything that can be done for such a terrible conundrum?!
A Health of Information,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,zecora,Hmmm.
A Health of Information,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,fluttershy,"Zecora, this is all my fault! If you hadn't been helping me get the crisscross moss, you wouldn't have gotten Swamp Fever. I'm so sorry."
A Health of Information,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,zecora,"Fluttershy, you are not to blame. These things happen all the same."
A Health of Information,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,fluttershy,I refuse to accept that! There has to be somepony who can help you!
A Health of Information,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,zecora,"Oh. There's a healer of legend who never would fail. But I only know her from ancient folktales. Mystical and masked, she came in the night and cured everything from hoof cough to fur blight. What became of the healer, nopony knows, for she disappeared ages and ages ago."
A Health of Information,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,fluttershy,The Mystical Mask! Of course! My parents would tell me about her whenever I was sick in bed.
A Health of Information,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,zecora,There's so many accounts of her power to heal. She can't just be a legend. I think she's real.
A Health of Information,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,fluttershy,"If that's who we need to cure you, then I'm going to find her! And I know just the pony who can help!"
A Health of Information,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,fluttershy,[pants] Oh.
A Health of Information,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,fluttershy,"Twilight? Twilight? Twilight! Oh, I'm so sorry to bother<U+0097> Are... Are you cooking?"
A Health of Information,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,twilight sparkle,Yeah! Spike and I are having a cook-off!
A Health of Information,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,spike,My cauliflower bites blew her sweet potato muffins out of the water!
A Health of Information,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,twilight sparkle,"I'm glad you're here, Fluttershy, because we're gonna need a second opinion about that."
A Health of Information,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,fluttershy,"[grunts, gulps, grunts, gulps] Um, they're both delicious, but... [quickly] Zecora-has-Swamp-Fever-and-there's-no-cure-and-it's-all-my-fault-and-the-only-pony-who-can-cure-it-is-the-Mystical-Mask-and-I-need-your-help-to-find-her!"
A Health of Information,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,twilight sparkle,Uh...
A Health of Information,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,spike,"So, what'd she pick? The cauliflower bites, right?"
A Health of Information,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,twilight sparkle,"[sighs] That's the last book on ancient ponies, and still no mention of the Mystical Mask."
A Health of Information,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,fluttershy,Hmm. Did we check the unabridged versions?
A Health of Information,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,twilight sparkle,"Yes, and the books on rare diseases, the books on rare plants, and the entire section on bog habitation."
A Health of Information,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,fluttershy,"Well, we might have to look through every book in the entire library, but I know we'll figure it out."
A Health of Information,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,twilight sparkle,Oh.
A Health of Information,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,fluttershy,"[sighs] Another dead end. Have you found anything yet, Twilight?"
A Health of Information,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,fluttershy,Twilight?
A Health of Information,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,twilight sparkle,Aah!
A Health of Information,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,fluttershy,Goodness! Are you okay?
A Health of Information,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,twilight sparkle,"[sighs] I'm fine. Fluttershy, you know that I want to help Zecora. But I think we'd be a lot better off if we got some sleep. We've been at this for hours."
A Health of Information,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,fluttershy,"Oh, I'm so sorry. I didn't realize how late it had gotten."
A Health of Information,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,twilight sparkle,No problem. I'll grab you a pillow and<U+0097>
A Health of Information,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,fluttershy,"Oh, no-no-no. I meant you should sleep. I can't rest until Zecora is healed."
A Health of Information,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,twilight sparkle,"I understand how you feel, but I still think we'd have more luck if we tried again in the morning. Just promise me you'll take a break soon."
A Health of Information,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,fluttershy,[not listening] Mm-hmm.
A Health of Information,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,twilight sparkle,"[yawns] Good night, Fluttershy."
A Health of Information,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,twilight sparkle,[snoring] 9-by-13-inch pan...
A Health of Information,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,fluttershy,Twilight!
A Health of Information,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,twilight sparkle,[awake] Nonstick pans!
A Health of Information,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,spike,"[groans] What's all the commotion in here, ladies?"
A Health of Information,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,fluttershy,"Sorry, but I figured out who the Mystical Mask is!"
A Health of Information,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,twilight sparkle,[gasps] You did?!
A Health of Information,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,fluttershy,"All I had to do was cross-reference a book about masks with another book on ancient Equestrian healers, then use a third book to translate it all from Olde Ponish, and there it was! Zecora was right! The Mystical Mask wasn't just a legend. The Mystical Mask was Mage Meadowbrook!"
A Health of Information,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,twilight sparkle,[gasps deeply] The ancient sorceress from Hayseed Swamp? We studied her at Celestia's school! Are you sure?
A Health of Information,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,fluttershy,"Absolutely! Mage Meadowbrook wasn't just a sorceress. She was also a healer, and back then, healers wore masks so they wouldn't get sick themselves!"
A Health of Information,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,twilight sparkle,"Fluttershy, I am so incredibly proud of you for using your research skills to figure this out! But Meadowbrook lived ages ago, and didn't she disappear?"
A Health of Information,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,fluttershy,"Mm-hmm. But if we go to Hayseed Swamp, maybe we can find something she left behind! Something that could lead to a cure!"
A Health of Information,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,twilight sparkle,"It seems like a long shot, but I guess it's possible."
A Health of Information,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,fluttershy,"[grunting] We have to try! I've got a route all planned out, and on the way, we can check up on Zecora, and then<U+0097>"
A Health of Information,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,twilight sparkle,"Whoa, whoa, whoa. We're leaving now?"
A Health of Information,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,fluttershy,Of course! Every second we spend waiting is a second Zecora is coughing bubbles!
A Health of Information,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,twilight sparkle,"But Fluttershy, you haven't slept! And that's a long journey!"
A Health of Information,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,fluttershy,"There's no use trying to talk me out of this, Twilight! [grunts] We've got no time to waste!"
A Health of Information,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,twilight sparkle,Can we at least grab some breakfast?
A Health of Information,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,fluttershy,I packed cauliflower bites.
A Health of Information,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,twilight sparkle,Aw. No sweet potato muffins?
A Health of Information,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,fluttershy,And that's when I realized the Mystical Mask was actually Mage Meadowbrook!
A Health of Information,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,zecora,"[coughs] That's marvelous, Fluttershy. I am quite impressed. While you are gone on your journey, I'll try not to be... worried."
A Health of Information,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,fluttershy,"[gasps] Oh, no. Zecora, you didn't rhyme! You must be getting worse."
A Health of Information,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,fluttershy,[gasps] That's it! We have to go now!
A Health of Information,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,twilight sparkle,"Lead the way, Fluttershy."
A Health of Information,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,twilight sparkle,So... [chuckles nervously] where do you think Meadowbrook lived?
A Health of Information,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,fluttershy,[yawns] I'm not sure. Maybe there's somepony we can ask.
A Health of Information,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,twilight sparkle,I think we might be the only ponies here.
A Health of Information,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,fluttershy,Wait! I recognize that tree! [gasps] Yes! This has to be it! It's just like the illustrations of her home!
A Health of Information,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,twilight sparkle,Anypony who lives in a tree is okay by me.
A Health of Information,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,twilight sparkle,Or we could try the handle.
A Health of Information,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,fluttershy,[laughs nervously] It really blends in with the bark.
A Health of Information,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,twilight sparkle,Easy to miss.
A Health of Information,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,fluttershy,"Wow. It looks like this place has been abandoned for years. [gasps] Twilight, look! It's the same kind of lilypad that gave Zecora Swamp Fever! Hmm. I wonder if Meadowbrook was looking for a cure for Swamp Fever, too. [gasps] Do you think she found it?"
A Health of Information,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,twilight sparkle,"I hope so, but let's not get ahead of ourselves."
A Health of Information,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,twilight sparkle,That's exactly what I'm talking about. You're making your excited squeaking noise!
A Health of Information,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,fluttershy,"Uh, I wasn't making my excited squeaking noise."
A Health of Information,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,twilight sparkle,Scare ponies or rock creepily in the dark?
A Health of Information,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,fluttershy,"Likewise, but, um, may I ask, why are you in Mage Meadowbrook's home?"
A Health of Information,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,fluttershy,[gasps] You're related to Mage Meadowbrook?
A Health of Information,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,fluttershy,"Oh, my goodness, Twilight, we did it! Not only did we find Mage Meadowbrook's old house <U+0096> we actually found one of her descendants!"
A Health of Information,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,twilight sparkle,"Honestly, I would not have guessed it."
A Health of Information,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,twilight sparkle,Library?! Now we're talkin'!
A Health of Information,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,twilight sparkle,Oh. Well... [chuckles] Libraries come in all shapes and sizes.
A Health of Information,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,fluttershy,This is good. It'll take us less time to go through everything.
A Health of Information,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,fluttershy,"[blows air, reading] ""Today, my mom made me eat peas. Peas are yucky."" And we can probably skip this one, unless she found a cure when she was a foal."
A Health of Information,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,fluttershy,"Wait! Listen to this! [reading] ""Today, I tried again to brew an unsniffle elixir..."""
A Health of Information,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,fluttershy,"[reading] ""It was the greatest feeling I've ever experienced, and I promise to dedicate my life to curing ponies all over Equestria!"""
A Health of Information,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,fluttershy,"So all we have to do is find those aggressive flash bees and get them to give us their honey! Of course, it doesn't say how she did that..."
A Health of Information,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,fluttershy,"What? Is my mane messy? I know I haven't slept in a while, but... [gasps] Oh, no! I've caught Swamp Fever!"
A Health of Information,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,fluttershy,Huh?
A Health of Information,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,twilight sparkle,[slightly muffled] Are you sure these are necessary?
A Health of Information,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,fluttershy,What?
A Health of Information,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,twilight sparkle,"I said, are you sure these are necessary?"
A Health of Information,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,fluttershy,Yes! I won't risk infecting you or Cattail!
A Health of Information,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,twilight sparkle,"What you can't risk is getting any sicker! If you don't rest, your symptoms will only get worse!"
A Health of Information,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,fluttershy,"Um, you don't know this about me, but I'm pretty good with animals. And besides, Dogtail<U+0097>"
A Health of Information,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,fluttershy,"Um, Zecora is counting on me. I have to help her, just like Meadowbrook helped her mother and all those bayou ponies long ago!"
A Health of Information,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,twilight sparkle,"But Fluttershy, as much as Meadowbrook took care of other ponies, I'm sure she also took care of herself."
A Health of Information,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,fluttershy,"[strained] You're not gonna change my mind, Twilight!"
A Health of Information,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,twilight sparkle,Are you sure you don't want me to come with you?
A Health of Information,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,fluttershy,"Hello, flash bees! I was hoping I could get some of your honey."
A Health of Information,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,fluttershy,"Oh! I see. You don't let others have any. Well, I'm sorry, but I really need it."
A Health of Information,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,fluttershy,"[squeaks] I didn't want it to have to come to this, but I'll just have to use... the Stare!"
A Health of Information,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,fluttershy,[groans] What happened? Where am I?
A Health of Information,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,twilight sparkle,[exhales] I'm so glad you're okay. You're still in Meadowbrook's tree.
A Health of Information,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,fluttershy,Goodness gracious! [coughs] Have you heard from Zecora? Is she okay?
A Health of Information,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,twilight sparkle,Uh...
A Health of Information,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,fluttershy,She's already turning into a tree?! I thought we'd have more time!
A Health of Information,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,twilight sparkle,"Actually, you've been asleep for three days."
A Health of Information,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,fluttershy,Three days?!
A Health of Information,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,twilight sparkle,"Mm-hmm. You were asleep so long, we were afraid you wouldn't be able to move when you woke up. But thankfully, you just wore yourself down!"
A Health of Information,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,fluttershy,"Oh, dear. We have to get back to the hive! I've wasted so much time, and<U+0097>!"
A Health of Information,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,twilight sparkle,Cattail's right. I can't even use magic to calm them down. We'll have to find another way to get the honey.
A Health of Information,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,twilight sparkle,He's been through a lot these past three days.
A Health of Information,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,fluttershy,Wait... Disguises...
A Health of Information,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,fluttershy,[gasps] That's it! I know how she did it! I know how Meadowbrook got the honey!
A Health of Information,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,fluttershy,This is how Meadowbrook got the honey from the flash bees!
A Health of Information,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,fluttershy,"No. The male bees aren't aggressive around the queen bee, and this mask has the same stripes that she does."
A Health of Information,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,twilight sparkle,"Fluttershy, that's brilliant!"
A Health of Information,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,fluttershy,There's no time to waste!
A Health of Information,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,twilight sparkle,Hooves crossed!
A Health of Information,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,fluttershy,[coughs] Mind over matter!
A Health of Information,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,fluttershy,Twilight... It's working!
A Health of Information,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,twilight sparkle,"I think she's cured now, Fluttershy."
A Health of Information,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,zecora,"Ohhh, I do feel fine, and this honey is divine."
A Health of Information,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,fluttershy,"Oh, you're rhyming again! Welcome back, my friend!"
A Health of Information,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,zecora,"Thank you, Fluttershy, for all you endured. If not for you, I would not be cured."
A Health of Information,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,fluttershy,"Oh, if it wasn't for me, you wouldn't have been sick in the first place."
A Health of Information,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,zecora,"Regret is not what you should feel, because on this journey, you've learned a great deal."
A Health of Information,Sammie Crowley & Whitney Wetta,fluttershy,"That's true. I certainly learned that if you don't take care of yourself, you won't be able to take care of anypony else. In fact, if I had rested like Twilight had suggested all along, maybe I would have thought to use Meadowbrook's mask sooner."
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,apple bloom,"Okay! let's see how your still life's comin' along, Kettle Corn!"
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,sweetie belle,"Well, that certainly is... round."
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,apple bloom,I'm afraid that's all the time we have today. We'll try somethin' else tomorrow.
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,scootaloo,"And on the way to figuring out what you're meant to do, you'll find a ton more stuff you like. That's what makes looking for your cutie mark so great."
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,apple bloom,"Sorry, everypony. We're closin' up shop. We'll have to help you out tomorrow."
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,scootaloo,I don't know if we can help them tomorrow. Working with blank flanks one at a time takes forever.
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,apple bloom,If only there was a way we could help a whole herd of them at once.
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,sweetie belle,That would be perfect! We'd save time and they could help each other!
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,scootaloo,"Just like we used to! Oh, but it'd have to be somewhere big enough to handle all those blank flanks."
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,sweetie belle,"Somewhere outside, with tons of activities to try."
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,apple bloom,Are you two thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,cutie mark crusaders,Cutie Mark Day Camp!
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,apple bloom,"And I know just the place, Applejack used to go there when she was little."
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,scootaloo,Camp Friendship! Oh. Sorry. I thought we were all gonna yell that one too.
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,apple bloom,"Attention, all blank flanks!"
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,scootaloo,And blank flank affiliates! Come to our cutie mark day camp to find out what you're truly good at!
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,sweetie belle,Bond with other blank flanks and find out what you're meant to do together!
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,scootaloo,"Hey, Rumble!"
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,rumble,"Oh, hey, Crusaders. Look, I can't stop. I've gotta meet my brother for... something."
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,apple bloom,No problem. Just wanted to make sure you heard about our cutie mark day camp. The first session's tomorrow.
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,rumble,"What? Oh, nothing. Come on! I want to show you a new dive roll I'm trying."
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,scootaloo,"Come one, come all! Cutie Mark Day Camp is for blank flanks of all kinds!"
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,apple bloom,"Welcome, cutie mark campers!"
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,sweetie belle,Who's excited to be here?
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,sweetie belle,"Well, we're excited too! At Cutie Mark Day Camp, you'll be able to try all kinds of things!"
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,apple bloom,Kayaking!
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,scootaloo,Horseshoe-tossing!
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,apple bloom,You can try 'em all! But the most important thing is that you'll be tryin' them together.
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,scootaloo,That's what worked for us!
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,rumble,I thought you said we were gonna go practice for the Wonderbolts Ponyville Extravaganza show.
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,sweetie belle,And we're glad to have you!
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,scootaloo,"U-Uh, Rainbow Dash is practically my sister, and she's a Wonderbolt too!"
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,pipsqueak,Do you know Spitfire?
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,apple bloom,All right! Looks like we found the first activity of the day <U+0096> the horseshoe toss!
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,sweetie belle,"Come on, Rumble!"
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,apple bloom,Step on up and show us how it's done!
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,rumble,Egh.
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,rumble,"[unenthusiastic] Whoops. Aw, it looks like I won't be getting my cutie mark in the horseshoe toss..."
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,sweetie belle,"Don't worry about it, Rumble. Hardly anypony finds their calling on the first try."
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,rumble,"Eh, I wasn't worried."
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,scootaloo,Good! 'Cause there's a ton of other stuff to try. We'll find you something you're good at.
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,rumble,Whoops.
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,rumble,Whoopsie.
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,rumble,Whoops.
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,rumble,[spits] [unenthusiastic] Whoops. I've tried it all. Time to tell my brother this Camp isn't for me.
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,scootaloo,"Come on, Rumble. Isn't it fun just trying stuff?"
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,rumble,Not really.
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,apple bloom,That's what Cutie Mark Day Camp is all about.
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,sweetie belle,Working together and helping each other.
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,scootaloo,Of course! Let's all meet right back here tomorrow.
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,sweetie belle,Wow. I can't believe we got a cutie mark on the first day!
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,apple bloom,Yup. This camp was a pretty swell idea. Everypony's really enjoyed it.
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,scootaloo,[sighs] Everypony except Rumble. He didn't have much luck with anything.
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,sweetie belle,Trying to find out what you're meant to do can be frustrating. You remember how long it took us to get our cutie marks?
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,apple bloom,[shivers] I remember the nightmares.
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,scootaloo,"Well, we can't let Rumble quit camp just because he didn't find something he's good at then."
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,sweetie belle,We'll just have to convince him to come back and try harder!
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,cutie mark crusaders,Mm-hmm!
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,scootaloo,"Hey, Rumble!"
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,rumble,What are you all doing here?
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,scootaloo,We just wanted to apologize for not finding anything you liked today.
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,rumble,Oh. Whatever. It's fine.
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,apple bloom,"It's not fine. It's frustrating, and we know what it's like."
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,rumble,I'm not frustrated!
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,scootaloo,It's okay! We've all been there. But we won't give up on helping you.
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,sweetie belle,We know you'll get your cutie mark. Everypony does.
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,rumble,"Actually, I don't need your help. Because I don't want to get my cutie mark!"
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,cutie mark crusaders,What?!
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,apple bloom,"I... I must have hay in my ears, because I thought I just heard Rumble say<U+0097>"
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,rumble,You heard right! I don't want my cutie mark!
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,sweetie belle,[gasps] He said it again!
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,scootaloo,Not wanting a cutie mark is like not wanting to breathe!
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,sweetie belle,Everypony wants to know what they're meant to do!
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,rumble,Hmph! Not this pony.
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,cutie mark crusaders,Why?!
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,rumble,"Because cutie marks are silly, and... a-and they just force you into one thing your whole life!"
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,sweetie belle,That's silly. Having a cutie mark doesn't mean you can't do other things.
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,apple bloom,"Yeah! Our cutie marks are in helpin' other ponies with their cutie marks, but I still like makin' potions with Zecora."
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,rumble,And when was the last time you did that?
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,apple bloom,"Um... I-I-I think it was, uh... Well, we've been pretty busy helpin' other ponies lately."
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,rumble,Oh. You mean doing the thing you got your cutie mark for? The thing you're stuck doing for the rest of your life?!
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,sweetie belle,Okay. Maybe we will be doing that more than anything else. But we love being Cutie Mark Crusaders!
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,rumble,"Well, that's fine for you, but I'm not gonna be put in a box!"
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,scootaloo,A blank flank who doesn't want a cutie mark? That's gotta be the strangest thing I've ever heard.
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,apple bloom,"Granny always says, ""Some ponies have to find their own hay."""
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,scootaloo,"Are you sure she didn't mean ""find their own way""?"
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,apple bloom,Oh. That would make more sense.
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,sweetie belle,"I can't believe Rumble isn't interested in getting his cutie mark either, but we can't force him."
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,scootaloo,And we've got a whole camp full of ponies who are interested in getting cutie marks.
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,cutie mark crusaders,Mm-hmm.
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,rumble,"[sighs] Here he comes. The fastest, most elite flyer in Equestria!"
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,rumble,"Whoa! [yelps] Urgh... I was gonna say me. You're not the only Pegasus in the family, you know."
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,rumble,[scoffs] That camp is for losers who can't do anything.
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,rumble,I'm not worried about that. I just don't want to get a cutie mark in any of their ridiculous activities.
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,rumble,Huh...
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,sweetie belle,"All right, cutie mark campers, that's it for jam-making!"
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,pipsqueak,"But this is fun, and I didn't get my cutie mark yet. What if I'm not good at anything else?"
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,scootaloo,You don't get a cutie mark just because you're good at something or even because you like it. There's more to it than that.
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,pipsqueak,So you can't get a cutie mark in something you like?
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,apple bloom,"Now, we didn't say that."
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,rumble,You don't have to!
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,scootaloo,"Rumble, you came back!"
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,rumble,Say bye-bye to painting circles. You'll be too busy haiku-ing from now on!
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,apple bloom,"Come on, Rumble. That's not how cutie marks work."
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,pipsqueak,So that's how cutie marks work?
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,apple bloom,Am I speakin' Olde Ponish?! I just said it wasn't!
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,rumble,"""Cutie marks are great,"" they say Pfft, yeah, right! They make you special in your way But that special mark that's just for you Will erase the stuff you liiiiiiike... to do"
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,sweetie belle,"Rumble, stop! That's just not true!"
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,rumble,"So you're good at charming snakes Too bad! Or you bake delicious cakes Oh, well! Maybe there are lots of things That you like to do Well, your options get pretty stark Once you got that cutie mark"
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,rumble,You say there's nothin' you can do?
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,rumble,A blank flank is the way for you It's no work to just be who you are No hunt to be some cutie star You're perfect just being you Don't bother with what you cannot do
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,rumble,...are better Nopony to tell you who you have to be
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,rumble,...are better Keep your spirit soarin' free
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,rumble,...so why keep tryin'? If you like just bein' you Then keepin' that blank flank blank Is the thiiiiiiiiiing to do!
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,pipsqueak,Whoopee!
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,apple bloom,"Now wait just an apple-pickin' minute, Rumble. Where do you think you're leadin' our campers?"
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,rumble,They're not your campers anymore! I'm starting a new camp!
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,rumble,Everypony on this side of the line is in Camp Blank Flanks Forever!
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,scootaloo,Whoa-whoa! You can't be a blank flank forever!
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,rumble,That's just the kind of talk I'd expect to hear from Camp Cutie Mark! Which is why blank flanks need a camp where we can enjoy being blank flanks and appreciate our blank flankiness without being pressured to get a cutie mark!
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,scootaloo,"Now hold on, everypony."
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,rumble,Blank flanks forever!
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,sweetie belle,What just happened?
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,scootaloo,Has everypony gone mad?!
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,apple bloom,In a word: yes.
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,sweetie belle,I just can't see what we did wrong. I thought everypony was having fun.
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,apple bloom,They were until that Rumble came and made a mess of things. What are they doing now?
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,scootaloo,It looks like whatever they want.
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,sweetie belle,"Honestly, it's not all that different from what they were doing here."
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,apple bloom,Then what was the point?
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,scootaloo,Point is that Rumble is a madpony who must be stopped!
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,sweetie belle,"Now calm down, Crusaders. We just need to talk to him again. The key is to remain calm."
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,sweetie belle,[yelling] Cutie marks... make you... special!
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,rumble,By putting you in a special little box!
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,sweetie belle,[yelling] Special!
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,rumble,Box!
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,apple bloom,"Come on, Sweetie Belle. I think you've ""remained calm"" long enough."
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,sweetie belle,"Kettle Corn, you covered your cutie mark?!"
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,sweetie belle,You just haiku'd right then!
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,rumble,Don't let them get in your head! You're an open-ended question! Blank flanks forever!
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,pipsqueak,Blank flanks forever! Blank flanks forever!
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,pipsqueak,Whoa! You're cracking great!
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,rumble,"Then you'll be stuck doing it forever! Blank flanks, no more potential cutie mark activities!"
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,sweetie belle,"Well, Cutie Mark Day Camp is a bust."
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,apple bloom,"No, it isn't! It's a swell idea! We just can't seem to talk any sense into that... that Rumble."
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,scootaloo,"Maybe we can't, but I bet I know somepony who can."
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,apple bloom,"Well, that doesn't make a lick of sense. Unless... he was bein' bad at stuff on purpose!"
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,scootaloo,Afraid of what?
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,scootaloo,"I don't understand. If Rumble wants to be a Wonderbolt someday, what's wrong with that?"
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,apple bloom,Sounds to me like Rumble isn't afraid of bein' put in a box at all.
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,sweetie belle,It doesn't?
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,apple bloom,Nope. I think Rumble's already picked out a box. He's afraid he'll get a cutie mark that'll keep him from it.
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,pipsqueak,"I don't know how to say this, Rumble, but Blank Flank Forever Camp is kinda..."
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,rumble,"If we wanna stay blank flanks, we can't risk doing stuff."
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,scootaloo,"Attention, blank flanks of Cutie Mark Day Camp!"
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,sweetie belle,The Cutie Mark Crusaders are pleased to announce today's special guest <U+0096> Thunderlane!
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,apple bloom,"Anypony who's interested, gather 'round for a day of activities with a genuine Wonderbolt!"
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,apple bloom,"All right, campers. It's time for our last activity of the day."
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,sweetie belle,A Wonderbolt obstacle course! Just like the one they'll fly through in their upcoming show!
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,scootaloo,"But on the ground, since not everypony has wings."
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,rumble,"Thunderlane, aren't you gonna run the course?"
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,rumble,Since when?
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,rumble,You do?
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,apple bloom,That haiku pretty well sums it up.
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,scootaloo,Looks like Thunderlane was right about the obstacle course getting Rumble to come back over.
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,sweetie belle,"Hey, Rumble. Aren't you gonna do our Wonderbolt course?"
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,rumble,I'm cooking today. Maybe I'll do the course tomorrow.
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,apple bloom,So you're comin' back tomorrow?
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,scootaloo,You're not worried about getting your cutie mark?
Marks and Recreation,May Chan,rumble,Nah. I already know I'm a good flyer. It kinda runs in the family. I guess it's time to see what other stuff I can do.
Once Upon a Zeppelin,Brittany Jo Flores,twilight sparkle,Oh!
Once Upon a Zeppelin,Brittany Jo Flores,spike,"[belches, sighs] Aw, thank goodness. I thought I had too many deep-fried gems."
Once Upon a Zeppelin,Brittany Jo Flores,twilight sparkle,"[mutters] It's from my parents! Spike, they won a zeppelin cruise and get to take the whole family! [sighs] I wish I had time to go with them, but there's just too many princess duties I have to take care of."
Once Upon a Zeppelin,Brittany Jo Flores,spike,"Come on, Twilight. Even Princess Celestia takes a break sometimes, and she raises the sun."
Once Upon a Zeppelin,Brittany Jo Flores,spike,"You need a vacation! I can keep track of the friendship log, boost community morale, and answer fan mail for a few days."
Once Upon a Zeppelin,Brittany Jo Flores,twilight sparkle,"But, Spike, you're as much a part of my family as anypony. I can't just leave you here to do all that work."
Once Upon a Zeppelin,Brittany Jo Flores,spike,[loudly] What?! I can't hear you! You're on vacation!
Once Upon a Zeppelin,Brittany Jo Flores,twilight sparkle,"I guess I could use a little time off from being a princess. You're the best, Spike!"
Once Upon a Zeppelin,Brittany Jo Flores,spike,I know.
Once Upon a Zeppelin,Brittany Jo Flores,twilight sparkle,I'm gonna go pack everything neatly into one suitcase!
Once Upon a Zeppelin,Brittany Jo Flores,spike,Wait for it...
Once Upon a Zeppelin,Brittany Jo Flores,twilight sparkle,"[shouting] Cruises have activities, right?! I should probably make a schedule?!"
Once Upon a Zeppelin,Brittany Jo Flores,spike,There it is.
Once Upon a Zeppelin,Brittany Jo Flores,shining armor,"Oh, I can't wait to get on this zeppelin and fly like a Pegasus!"
Once Upon a Zeppelin,Brittany Jo Flores,twilight sparkle,Really? I remember you getting airsick on Admiral Fairweather's Wild Ride at Pony Island.
Once Upon a Zeppelin,Brittany Jo Flores,shining armor,"Oh, please! I grew out of airsickness a long time ago."
Once Upon a Zeppelin,Brittany Jo Flores,iron will,"[over loudspeaker] I hope you ponies feel welcomed aboard, because you are!"
Once Upon a Zeppelin,Brittany Jo Flores,twilight sparkle,"Well, that was an... assertive welcome."
Once Upon a Zeppelin,Brittany Jo Flores,twilight sparkle,Wait. You don't know where this prize came from?
Once Upon a Zeppelin,Brittany Jo Flores,twilight sparkle,"Well, I did categorize the ship's activities and make a schedule organized by each of our interests. Dad, you're easy. Bingo competition right here."
Once Upon a Zeppelin,Brittany Jo Flores,twilight sparkle,"Shining Armor, they've got a tiny boat race in a tiny pool here."
Once Upon a Zeppelin,Brittany Jo Flores,shining armor,"Aw, sis. Only you would remember I love tiny things."
Once Upon a Zeppelin,Brittany Jo Flores,twilight sparkle,"And Cadance, there's a Peewee Princess Playtime here that Flurry's gonna love!"
Once Upon a Zeppelin,Brittany Jo Flores,princess cadance,"Oh, wonderful!"
Once Upon a Zeppelin,Brittany Jo Flores,twilight sparkle,"Eh. I just want to see you all have a good time. And this works out perfectly, because we have room for the one thing I wanna do! Our ship passes the Frozen North at sunset, which is the only time you can see the astrological phenomenon known as the Northern Stars. It's like the stars are shooting out of the setting sun!"
Once Upon a Zeppelin,Brittany Jo Flores,princess cadance,"Well, we definitely don't want to miss that."
Once Upon a Zeppelin,Brittany Jo Flores,twilight sparkle,Then it's settled. Hmm. But we don't have anything to do right now. Any suggestions?
Once Upon a Zeppelin,Brittany Jo Flores,iron will,"[over loudspeaker] Attention, cruise ponies! Don't let this zeppelin be a bore! Leave your room and see the tour!"
Once Upon a Zeppelin,Brittany Jo Flores,princess cadance,A tour could be fun.
Once Upon a Zeppelin,Brittany Jo Flores,princess cadance,"I'm afraid Flurry may be airsick. Since I know that isn't a problem for you, would you mind taking her below?"
Once Upon a Zeppelin,Brittany Jo Flores,iron will,"[over loudspeaker] Far to our right, you can just make out the white tufts of Cloudsdale, where Princess Twilight Sparkle once toured the weather factory."
Once Upon a Zeppelin,Brittany Jo Flores,twilight sparkle,How'd he know that? And why announce it on a cruise?
Once Upon a Zeppelin,Brittany Jo Flores,princess cadance,Why don't we move to the other side of the deck?
Once Upon a Zeppelin,Brittany Jo Flores,iron will,"[over loudspeaker] We are now high enough to see all of Canterlot, even the royal tree where Princess Twilight and her brother Shining Armor were born!"
Once Upon a Zeppelin,Brittany Jo Flores,twilight sparkle,What? That's not right.
Once Upon a Zeppelin,Brittany Jo Flores,twilight sparkle,"Um, you guys know that's not where we were born. What are you so excited about?"
Once Upon a Zeppelin,Brittany Jo Flores,twilight sparkle,"Um... yeah. Us, too."
Once Upon a Zeppelin,Brittany Jo Flores,iron will,"[over loudspeaker] On our route north, we will pass the spires of the Crystal Empire, where Princess Cadance rescued her Alicorn baby Spike from a monster made of fire!"
Once Upon a Zeppelin,Brittany Jo Flores,princess cadance,"Well, that doesn't even make sense."
Once Upon a Zeppelin,Brittany Jo Flores,twilight sparkle,What?!
Once Upon a Zeppelin,Brittany Jo Flores,princess cadance,Uh... Oh!
Once Upon a Zeppelin,Brittany Jo Flores,twilight sparkle,"Okay, that's it! Does anypony know where the cruise announcer is?"
Once Upon a Zeppelin,Brittany Jo Flores,twilight sparkle,"Excuse me, sir."
Once Upon a Zeppelin,Brittany Jo Flores,iron will,"You can call Iron Will ""Iron Will""!"
Once Upon a Zeppelin,Brittany Jo Flores,twilight sparkle,[gasps] What are you doing here? And why do you keep announcing random things about me and my family?
Once Upon a Zeppelin,Brittany Jo Flores,iron will,"The assertiveness seminar market dried up, so Iron Will started a new career organizing themed vacation packages!"
Once Upon a Zeppelin,Brittany Jo Flores,twilight sparkle,And the theme of this vacation is...
Once Upon a Zeppelin,Brittany Jo Flores,iron will,"[over loudspeaker] Everypony, stomp your hooves if you are here for the premiere Cruise of the Princesses Experience!"
Once Upon a Zeppelin,Brittany Jo Flores,twilight sparkle,"Iron Will, I'm not sure it was entirely honest of you to offer this cruise to my family without telling us that ponies bought tickets just to see Cadance and me!"
Once Upon a Zeppelin,Brittany Jo Flores,iron will,Iron Will outlined all the details of the cruise in the Prize Acceptance and Consent Form that you signed.
Once Upon a Zeppelin,Brittany Jo Flores,iron will,"Iron Will prides himself on providing a quality vacation experience. But if Twilight Sparkle and her family don't want it, Iron Will can cancel the cruise and break the hearts of every princess-adoring pony on board."
Once Upon a Zeppelin,Brittany Jo Flores,princess cadance,"As much as I want a family vacation, I don't think I could entertain all these cruise ponies. My hooves are pretty full taking care of Flurry Heart."
Once Upon a Zeppelin,Brittany Jo Flores,twilight sparkle,"Wait! Iron Will, what if I offered you a deal? If I agree to do whatever princess activities you want, will you promise that my family gets to do the activities they want?"
Once Upon a Zeppelin,Brittany Jo Flores,shining armor,"Sis, you don't have to do that. We want you to enjoy yourself, too."
Once Upon a Zeppelin,Brittany Jo Flores,twilight sparkle,"I don't want the vacation to end now or let down all these ponies who were looking forward to seeing us. So what do you say, Iron Will? Do we have a deal?"
Once Upon a Zeppelin,Brittany Jo Flores,iron will,Princess Twilight has a deal!
Once Upon a Zeppelin,Brittany Jo Flores,twilight sparkle,Great! So it looks like we have some time before Dad plays Bingo.
Once Upon a Zeppelin,Brittany Jo Flores,iron will,"Actually, we have just enough to pick the winner of our grand-prize raffle."
Once Upon a Zeppelin,Brittany Jo Flores,twilight sparkle,Oh. Well... [chuckles] who doesn't like prizes?
Once Upon a Zeppelin,Brittany Jo Flores,iron will,"All right, cruise ponies! When the zeppelin flies, it's time for a prize!"
Once Upon a Zeppelin,Brittany Jo Flores,twilight sparkle,"Thank you all for being so gracious and respectful to me and my family. And now, without further ado, the winner is..."
Once Upon a Zeppelin,Brittany Jo Flores,twilight sparkle,Star Tracker!
Once Upon a Zeppelin,Brittany Jo Flores,twilight sparkle,"Congratulations, Star Tracker! Enjoy your prize! Okay, Dad! Bingo time!"
Once Upon a Zeppelin,Brittany Jo Flores,twilight sparkle,Uh... Oh. I'm sorry. I don't have the prize.
Once Upon a Zeppelin,Brittany Jo Flores,iron will,"Congratulations to Star Tracker, who wins the grand prize <U+0096> spending the day with Twilight as an honorary member of her family!"
Once Upon a Zeppelin,Brittany Jo Flores,twilight sparkle,That's the prize?!
Once Upon a Zeppelin,Brittany Jo Flores,twilight sparkle,"Okay, well... I guess you should come with us, honorary family member."
Once Upon a Zeppelin,Brittany Jo Flores,twilight sparkle,[amplified] Ahem! Is everypony ready?
Once Upon a Zeppelin,Brittany Jo Flores,twilight sparkle,Dad? [amplified] What did you say?
Once Upon a Zeppelin,Brittany Jo Flores,twilight sparkle,"Oh. Um, thanks."
Once Upon a Zeppelin,Brittany Jo Flores,twilight sparkle,[amplified] I-19!
Once Upon a Zeppelin,Brittany Jo Flores,twilight sparkle,"Did you get that one, Dad? [amplified] Can anypony tell me how my dad is doing?"
Once Upon a Zeppelin,Brittany Jo Flores,twilight sparkle,Phew! Just made it!
Once Upon a Zeppelin,Brittany Jo Flores,twilight sparkle,And I'm ready to give you the tiny boat race of your life!
Once Upon a Zeppelin,Brittany Jo Flores,twilight sparkle,"Are you sure you're not airsick, big brother?"
Once Upon a Zeppelin,Brittany Jo Flores,twilight sparkle,I don't think that's how it works. But I'm ready if you are.
Once Upon a Zeppelin,Brittany Jo Flores,iron will,"Technically, Princess Twilight Sparkle should officiate the princess paddle boat race."
Once Upon a Zeppelin,Brittany Jo Flores,twilight sparkle,"Oh. Well, as long as Shining Armor gets to race, I'm happy."
Once Upon a Zeppelin,Brittany Jo Flores,twilight sparkle,"On your mark, get set<U+0097>"
Once Upon a Zeppelin,Brittany Jo Flores,shining armor,"[nauseous] Just so everypony knows, I'm getting out of this boat because of how not sick I feel."
Once Upon a Zeppelin,Brittany Jo Flores,iron will,[through microphone] That was just the first heat! Of ten!
Once Upon a Zeppelin,Brittany Jo Flores,iron will,"Now, who's ready to see a princess face when they win their race?!"
Once Upon a Zeppelin,Brittany Jo Flores,twilight sparkle,"Cadance, I'm so glad you got in the Peewee Princess Playtime!"
Once Upon a Zeppelin,Brittany Jo Flores,princess cadance,Flurry is having a wonderful time.
Once Upon a Zeppelin,Brittany Jo Flores,twilight sparkle,That's great. I'm just on my way to take some old-time Appleloosan photos!
Once Upon a Zeppelin,Brittany Jo Flores,twilight sparkle,And then do a quick question-and-answer session on becoming an Alicorn before Mom's barrel ride at Neighagra Falls! I really hope I don't miss that.
Once Upon a Zeppelin,Brittany Jo Flores,princess cadance,"Twilight, are you sure you don't mind doing all of these princess activities?"
Once Upon a Zeppelin,Brittany Jo Flores,twilight sparkle,"Mind? What? Absolutely not. I mean, you guys are having fun, right? [sighs] Besides, I have to make sure these cruise ponies are happy if I want to be a good princess."
Once Upon a Zeppelin,Brittany Jo Flores,princess cadance,"You're already a good princess, Twilight."
Once Upon a Zeppelin,Brittany Jo Flores,twilight sparkle,"Honestly, as long as I get to see the Northern Stars tonight with everypony, I'll be happy. But right now, I gotta go take some pictures. See you later!"
Once Upon a Zeppelin,Brittany Jo Flores,princess cadance,"Uh... I am so sorry, everypony, but it looks like Flurry needs her nap."
Once Upon a Zeppelin,Brittany Jo Flores,twilight sparkle,"Oh, why did that last question have to be a two-parter? I just hope I have time for one barrel ride with Mom!"
Once Upon a Zeppelin,Brittany Jo Flores,twilight sparkle,Disappointed? No! I've just been answering some detailed questions about Alicorns! You know how much I love details!
Once Upon a Zeppelin,Brittany Jo Flores,twilight sparkle,How can I when it's a totally successful vacation?
Once Upon a Zeppelin,Brittany Jo Flores,iron will,"Iron Will lived up to his side of the bargain, and Princess Twilight only has one more thing to do for the day."
Once Upon a Zeppelin,Brittany Jo Flores,iron will,[through microphone] It's your last chance. Come get in line if you want the princess to sign!
Once Upon a Zeppelin,Brittany Jo Flores,twilight sparkle,[sighs] How long have you been waiting?
Once Upon a Zeppelin,Brittany Jo Flores,princess cadance,"You were right, Twilight. They were breathtaking."
Once Upon a Zeppelin,Brittany Jo Flores,twilight sparkle,"[suddenly indignant] Oh, yeah. The cruise ponies are happy. My family is happy. Even Iron Will is happy."
Once Upon a Zeppelin,Brittany Jo Flores,twilight sparkle,You know who isn't happy? Me!
Once Upon a Zeppelin,Brittany Jo Flores,twilight sparkle,[insincerely] I'm sorry. But maybe that wouldn't have happened if you weren't practically standing on my tail! Not even my real family stands so close! Rrgh!
Once Upon a Zeppelin,Brittany Jo Flores,princess cadance,Twilight?
Once Upon a Zeppelin,Brittany Jo Flores,twilight sparkle,I only made that deal with Iron Will so my family and the cruise ponies could have the vacation they wanted.
Once Upon a Zeppelin,Brittany Jo Flores,princess cadance,What about what you wanted?
Once Upon a Zeppelin,Brittany Jo Flores,twilight sparkle,I just want everypony to be happy.
Once Upon a Zeppelin,Brittany Jo Flores,princess cadance,"Well, sometimes ponies want more from a princess than you can give, and it can be hard to know where to draw the line."
Once Upon a Zeppelin,Brittany Jo Flores,twilight sparkle,You seem to know pretty well.
Once Upon a Zeppelin,Brittany Jo Flores,princess cadance,"Once I had Flurry Heart, the line was easier for me to see. You will always have obligations as a princess, but you also have an obligation to yourself."
Once Upon a Zeppelin,Brittany Jo Flores,twilight sparkle,"[sighs] You're right. I think I need to set some boundaries. But first, I owe somepony an apology."
Once Upon a Zeppelin,Brittany Jo Flores,twilight sparkle,"No, Star Tracker. You should stay. I have something to tell you. All of you. I'm glad you all got to do the things you wanted, but I should have stood up for myself so that I could do what I wanted, too. [to Star Tracker] It wasn't fair of me to lash out at you. If I felt like you were standing too close, I should have said something. I'm sorry. [to everypony] What do you say we do something off the schedule?"
Once Upon a Zeppelin,Brittany Jo Flores,twilight sparkle,"Yup! We're gonna do something I want us to do, as a family. Honorary members, too."
Once Upon a Zeppelin,Brittany Jo Flores,twilight sparkle,Ohhh!
Once Upon a Zeppelin,Brittany Jo Flores,iron will,"[through microphone] Attention, cruise ponies! If it's your dream, come to the deck for ice cream!"
Once Upon a Zeppelin,Brittany Jo Flores,iron will,What did you say to Iron Will?
Once Upon a Zeppelin,Brittany Jo Flores,twilight sparkle,"It's okay, everypony. [through microphone] [clears throat] First, I want to thank all of you for coming. It means a lot that you'd spend your hard-earned bits just to be with us. But I honestly came on this cruise to take some time off from being a princess. I'm just a pony, too, after all. And even though I want everypony here to be happy, I'd really like to spend the rest of the cruise relaxing with my family."
Once Upon a Zeppelin,Brittany Jo Flores,iron will,[whistling] Iron Will's Cruise of the Princesses makes no guarantees as to the participation of actual princesses.
Once Upon a Zeppelin,Brittany Jo Flores,iron will,But Iron Will learned his lesson before. Satisfaction not guaranteed. No refuuuuuuunds!
Once Upon a Zeppelin,Brittany Jo Flores,shining armor,"Wow. He may be pushy and manipulative, but nopony can say that minotaur isn't prepared."
Once Upon a Zeppelin,Brittany Jo Flores,twilight sparkle,There's still plenty of activities. We pass Fillydelphia on the way back. I could give Flurry Heart a quick history tour.
Once Upon a Zeppelin,Brittany Jo Flores,princess cadance,"That's very thoughtful. But right now, the family and I have something scheduled for you."
Once Upon a Zeppelin,Brittany Jo Flores,twilight sparkle,"You did all this for me? This is amazing! Thank you. And Shining Armor, I can't believe you're up there even though you're airsick!"
Once Upon a Zeppelin,Brittany Jo Flores,shining armor,"I am not air<U+0097> [gurgles] [nauseous] Oh, okay. Maybe I'm not feeling great!"
Once Upon a Zeppelin,Brittany Jo Flores,twilight sparkle,Now this is the only activity I need.
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,pinkie pie,"Okay. All we need is a dot of salt, a dab of sugar, and a spritz of ginger."
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,twilight sparkle,Uh... Are those real measurements? How do you keep track without a recipe?
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,pinkie pie,Pie baking is more art than science. And this will be my masterpiece! It's to celebrate Rainbow Dash's seventy-third Wonderbolt training session!
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,twilight sparkle,Seventy-third? That's specific.
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,pinkie pie,"I know! The pie is blueberry because Wonderbolt outfits are blue. The crust is rainbow, for obvious reasons. But the most special part is the seventy-three super secret sweets and spices that represent each training session! [giggles] Could you please pass the... [quickly] brown sugar, pink sugar, sweetroot, apple jelly, berry mash, and a towel?"
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,twilight sparkle,You sure are going to a lot of trouble for Rainbow Dash's pie.
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,pinkie pie,"Phew! That's because I know how much she loves them! My pies are her favorite! It's worth all the trouble to see her happy. Now I'm going to need some cocoa powder, cocoa flakes<U+0097> Ooh! Cocoa bar! [chomp] [mouthful] Want some?"
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,twilight sparkle,Isn't that for the pie?
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,pinkie pie,"[gulps, laughing] Oh, Twilight! That's hilarious! You don't mix chocolate into a blueberry pie! This is my mid morning, pie-making chocolate fuel that keeps this pie baking train chugging down the tracks! [chomp, babbles, gulp] Break time's over! Now let's finish this pie! Chugga-chugga, chugga-chugga, choo-choo!"
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,spitfire,"Good training, everypony. Nice work, Crash. You really added that sparkle to that pressure diamond-drop."
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,rainbow dash,My seventy-third training session? That's specific.
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,pinkie pie,"I know! I'm just so proud and happy for you, and I've been counting all your training sessions, and I was going to wait until your hundredth, but I got too excited, and I know how much you love pie, so happy seventy-third training session!"
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,rainbow dash,Whaaa?! You didn't have to do this.
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,pinkie pie,"I know I didn't have to, but I reeeally wanted to! [squealing] Have a bite."
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,rainbow dash,"Whoa! What's that?! Huh. Guess it was nothing. But wow, heh. This pie is the best I've ever had! Mmm! Is that cinnamon?"
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,pinkie pie,I knew you'd love it! Have more. I made the whole thing for you.
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,rainbow dash,"Really? Oh, that's so great! But I need to go change. A-And then I have to take Tank to the vet. Heh. His sensitive tortoise tummy's been acting up again. Do you mind if I take this pie with me?"
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,pinkie pie,Of course not! I gotta get back to my shift at Sugarcube Corner anyway. Congratulations again!
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,rainbow dash,Heh. Thanks.
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,pinkie pie,[sighs] I knew she'd love it. [gasps deeply] Is that...? Is that...?!
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,pinkie pie,Stop!
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,pinkie pie,"You didn't see a blueberry rainbow-crust seventy-three-ingredient pie with a slice eaten out of it in here, did you?"
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,pinkie pie,"Right. Of course you didn't. That would be ridiculous. Because I made it for Rainbow Dash, and she loves my pies. She would never throw them away like trash in the trash with other trash, right? Right?!"
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,pinkie pie,"Hmmm... That pie couldn't have been the one I made. I must be seeing things. I did have a lot of chocolate this morning. [chomp, gulps] But what if I wasn't seeing things? What if that was my pie? [scoffs] That would be bananas! [chuckles, laughing crazily] [gasps] Unless Rainbow Dash's been replaced by an imposter who throws delicious pies away!"
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,pinkie pie,Or... has she been brainwashed by a pie-hating evil queen?
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,pinkie pie,"You make a good point. Rainbow Dash is too stubborn to be brainwashed. Plus she hates washing. Hmm. There's something else going on here. Let's look up a few of the more recent pies I've made for her. The boysenberry pie I made for her birthday... and her three half-birthday lemon meringues... and the ""It's Not Your Birthday But Here's a Pie Anyway Day"" custard pie! She ate all of these... Right?"
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,rainbow dash,[gasps] Another pie!? Thank you so much! Whoa! What's that?!
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,rainbow dash,[chewing noises] Huh. Guess it was nothing. Heh-heh.
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,rainbow dash,"Awesome! Three lemon meringues? Uh... Hey, what's that over there?"
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,rainbow dash,"[chewing noises] Oh, never mind. Heh. Great pies!"
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,pinkie pie,"Happy ""It's Not Your Birthday But Here's a Pie Anyway"" Day!"
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,rainbow dash,Thank you! No way! Check that out!
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,rainbow dash,"Oh, sorry. Guess it was nothing. [slurp] Mmm! But that custard was everything!"
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,pinkie pie,Have I ever really seen Rainbow Dash eat one of my pies? And do I always look when somepony points behind me? What's there?! Heh. Good one. But I need answers.
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,pinkie pie,"I've sent Rainbow Dash a pie every month she's been a Wonderbolt, and you're telling me you've never seen her eat one?"
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,spitfire,"Uh, affirmative. Or, uh, negative. Um... I-I-I mean, she wasn't seen eating one."
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,pinkie pie,Hmm... Interesting. Very interesting.
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,spitfire,Are we under investigation?
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,pinkie pie,"As chief detective on the pie case, I've labeled you all ponies-of-interest. So it's best you tell me everything you know."
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,spitfire,"Well, we have been getting mysterious monthly pie donations."
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,pinkie pie,[gasps] Would you be able to pick these pies out of a line up?
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,pinkie pie,I hear Rainbow Dash's pet tortoise Tank has been having tummy troubles. When did it start?
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,pinkie pie,"Hmmm... And this all happened the day after I made Rainbow Dash a ""Thanks For Lending Me Your Jacket"" peach pie. It seems the pieces of the puzzle are plopping into place, but the picture isn't pretty. [gasps] Note to self <U+0096> P. Alliteration Pie. Is that everything, Doctor?"
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,pinkie pie,Interesting. Did you have the lab analyze the flavor of that pie?
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,pinkie pie,Perhaps. And I just might know Pony Patient Zero!
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,cheerilee,Dr. Fauna's right. I do always have to remind the foals and fillies not to share the pies with the class hamster. Animals just can't digest pony food.
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,pinkie pie,Indeed. But where do these pies come from?
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,cheerilee,"Well, they're from Rainbow Dash. She drops off her ""Day After Rainbow Dash's Half-Birthday"" pie every year."
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,pinkie pie,"Did you say the day after her half-birthday?! Very, very interesting. Because I give her a pie on her half-birthday every year! And I have a feeling it's the same pie."
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,cheerilee,"Well, wherever it comes from, the students just love it."
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,pinkie pie,I'm so glad. At least I can be sure somepony is.
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,pinkie pie,"She didn't eat the blueberry. She didn't eat the banana. She didn't eat the cream, and she didn't eat the chocolate. She didn't eat any of 'em! Why?! And don't tell me this all just started recently! It's been going on for years! Cheerilee said so herself. If there's one thing I know, you can't escape the truth!"
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,applejack,Pinkie Pie?! Pinkie Pie!
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,applejack,Whooooaaaa! [grunting] Oh. Party-planning cave. Right. You okay? Or are you just screamin' for fun?
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,pinkie pie,"Screaming is fun. But I'm not okay! I've been making Rainbow Dash pies for years, but she doesn't even like them. She's been lying to me!"
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,applejack,But everypony loves your pies. they're the greatest thing since sliced apples.
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,pinkie pie,Thank you!
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,applejack,And I could swear I've seen her eat one of your pies before.
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,pinkie pie,Have you reeeaaally?
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,applejack,"Um, I... thought I had. That's why I said it?"
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,pinkie pie,Are you sure?
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,applejack,Maybe I haven't...?
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,pinkie pie,Exactly! Because it's all been a sham! Rainbow Dash has been laughing at my pies behind my back and scheming of a way to get rid of them for years!
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,rainbow dash,Bring forth the worst-tasting food in all of Equestria!
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,rainbow dash,"And now I will destroy Pinkie Pie's horrid abominations, freeing the land of these disgusting pies forever!"
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,pinkie pie,Nooooooo!
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,rainbow dash,"Good riddance, strawberry cream and peaches 'o plenty! Begone, apple crumble and lemon surprise!"
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,applejack,I really don't think that's what's happening.
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,pinkie pie,I don't think so either. I know so.
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,applejack,"Well, I've got just the thing to get your mind off all this madness. We've had a great apple harvest, so I was hopin' you could whip up a few of your delicious pies."
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,pinkie pie,"Yes. I will make pies. Lots of pies. I'm going to make Rainbow Dash so many pies, it'll force her to admit the truth. Or I'll catch her in the act of getting rid of them. Operation: ""Pie of Lies"" is a go. Thanks, Applejack. I knew I could count on you to come up with a plan."
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,applejack,"I don't think that's what I did. Also, uh... how do you get out of here?"
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,pinkie pie,Surprise!
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,rainbow dash,[yelps] W-W-What's happening?!
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,pinkie pie,"Happy unofficial ""Wake Your Friends Up"" Day!"
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,rainbow dash,"Ugh. I've never heard of ""Wake Your Friends Up"" Day."
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,pinkie pie,"Well, it's unofficial. But I made you your favorite pie in celebration! Ta-da! Gifts are the second most important part of ""Wake Your Friends Up"" Day."
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,rainbow dash,What's the first most important part?
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,pinkie pie,Accepting the gifts and enjoying them immediately.
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,rainbow dash,"Uh... Well, I'm sorry I forgot about ""Wake Your Friends Up"" Day. Let me make it up to you. Here!"
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,pinkie pie,[sneezes] The pie! Where'd it go?!
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,rainbow dash,What do you mean where did it go? Heh-heh. Mmm-mmm.
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,pinkie pie,Congratulations on your seventy-fourth Wonderbolt training session! Here's a pie. Now eat it!
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,rainbow dash,"Okay, this is getting a little out of hoof. I haven't even trained yet."
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,pinkie pie,"Well, I wanted to pre-celebrate because I already know how great you're gonna do. Eat the pie!"
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,rainbow dash,"Pinkie, look out!"
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,rainbow dash,Pinkie! Are you okay?!
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,pinkie pie,[grunting] Get me down!
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,pinkie pie,But the pie! What happened to the pie?!
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,rainbow dash,Oh! The pie was delicious! You just get better!
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,pinkie pie,Noooooooo!
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,pinkie pie,"[unconvincing] Ah! Somepony help me! Rainbow Dash, thank goodness you're here! I was trying to fix the top pie on my pie pyramid, but the whole thing became unstable. And there's only one way to save me! You have to eat the pies!"
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,rainbow dash,"Don't worry, I got ya!"
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,pinkie pie,"Oh, right. Or you could save me that way."
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,rainbow dash,"You gotta be more careful, okay?"
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,pinkie pie,[growls] Rrgh!
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,pinkie pie,"Rainbow Dash! I wanted to thank you for saving me from the pie pyramid, so have a pie! Have three! Have fifteen! I know how much you love them! Now eat up!"
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,rainbow dash,Uh... Thanks!
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,rainbow dash,I can't wait to eat [loudly] all these pies!
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,pinkie pie,What!? Where did they<U+0097>?! How did you<U+0097>?!
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,rainbow dash,"Delicious! You did it again, Pinkie!"
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,pinkie pie,"Rainbow Dash, there you are! I made a pie for everypony, and you're the only one who hasn't eaten hers yet. So here. Your pie. For you to eat. Now."
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,rainbow dash,Are you okay? You seem to be staring more than usual.
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,rainbow dash,You sure you don't have to blink?
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,pinkie pie,Me? Nope. I'm not much of a blinker. [licking] Don't mind me. Go ahead and take a bite.
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,rainbow dash,"Well... Do I want to take a big bite or a small bite...? I just don't know... Or maybe medium? No, no, no. Definitely not medium."
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,pinkie pie,[panting] [strained] Just try some.
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,rainbow dash,Ahhhh... Do you have any milk?
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,rainbow dash,"Ah, never mind. Your pies are just too good to resist."
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,pinkie pie,What?! No! No! That's it! I can't take it!
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,rainbow dash,"Uh, everything okay, Pinkie?"
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,pinkie pie,No! Everything is not okay! You hate my pies!
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,rainbow dash,What are you talking about?
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,pinkie pie,"You know exactly what I'm talking about! I saw what you did! Well, I didn't see what you did. But I know that you've been fake-eating my pies! You threw away the pie I made for your seventy-third Wonderbolt training session, and I know you secretly somehow got rid of all the other pies I gave you! Admit it!"
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,rainbow dash,That's crazy! What do you think I did? Somehow make them all disappear into thin air?
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,rainbow dash,[nervous chuckle] Okay. So maybe I made one of them disappear into thin air.
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,pinkie pie,How could you?!
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,rainbow dash,"What?! I, uh... I-I just wanted to share these amazing pies with the folks of Cloudsdale! So I, uh... I was trying to send them up via... balloon mail."
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,pinkie pie,But you just said they were delicious.
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,rainbow dash,"Well, obviously that's because... I have amnesia!"
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,rainbow dash,I've been brainwashed!
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,rainbow dash,I-It's Opposite Day?
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,pinkie pie,"Your memory is working fine, you hate washing, and I know today's not Opposite Day because I baked you a pie for it every year. A pie that you'd probably just throw away. Or give to charity. Or destroy with your laser eyes while laughing at me!"
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,rainbow dash,Laser eyes?
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,pinkie pie,Oh! Oh! So you admit it!
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,rainbow dash,What? No! I can explain!
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,pinkie pie,I don't want to hear it!
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,rainbow dash,She won't listen to me. She won't let me apologize. [sighs] I feel terrible.
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,twilight sparkle,"Well, you have been lying to her. To all of us, actually."
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,applejack,Yeah. Is there anything else you're lyin' about that we should know?
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,rainbow dash,"No! Well, not that I can think of off the top of my head. Is it my fault that I don't like pies? And not just Pinkie's pies. All pies! I know how much she loves making pies, and if I told her I didn't like them, it would have crushed her."
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,applejack,"Uh, you kinda crushed her anyway."
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,rainbow dash,"Oh, but I...! [stutters, sighs] You're right. I guess I should've just eaten the pies in the first place. [gasps] Wait! That's it! I know how I can make it up to her!"
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,pinkie pie,"Pee-yew! Gummy, is that you?"
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,pinkie pie,Huh. What is that? Oh. It's you.
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,rainbow dash,"Pinkie Pie, wait! I know now that I should've been honest with you from the start, because lying to your friends is wrong. And because getting rid of all those pies was a giant hassle. I mean, do you have any idea how many pies you've made for me over the years?"
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,pinkie pie,"Yes, I know exactly how many. I have a very detailed pie-ling system."
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,rainbow dash,"Of course you do. The point is I thought the hassle was worth it just to spare your feelings, but I was wrong. So to make up for it, I made this pie for you. Well, I guess I made it for me. To eat in front of you. Point is I'm eating this pie for friendship!"
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,pinkie pie,Wait. That smelly circular monstrosity is a pie?
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,rainbow dash,"Yeah! I know I can't go back and eat all the pies you made for me in the past, so instead I'm going to eat this one giant one for you now. So here I go."
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,rainbow dash,Ahhhh...
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,pinkie pie,Wait! I can't watch you do this!
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,pinkie pie,"I mean, is that crust or some kind of concrete?"
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,rainbow dash,"Yeah, honestly, I have no idea."
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,pinkie pie,"Oh, I can't believe you're willing to eat this terrible pie for me. It's ridiculous, and this whole thing is overly complicated, and... [sighs] I think I finally understand why you lied."
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,rainbow dash,Whoa! What's that?!
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,rainbow dash,[chewing noises] Huh. Guess it was nothing. Heh-heh.
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,pinkie pie,[squeals] I'm so glad you enjoyed my pies!
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,rainbow dash,"[chewing noises] Oh, never mind. Heh. Great pies!"
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,rainbow dash,No way! Check that out!
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,rainbow dash,"Oh, sorry. Guess it was nothing. [slurp] Mmm! But that custard was everything!"
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,pinkie pie,Seeing you eat my pies makes me the happiest pony in all of Equestria!
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,rainbow dash,Heh. I know it does.
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,pinkie pie,You did a lot of ridiculous and overly complex things to get rid of my pies because it made you happy to see me happy. Just like I went to a lot of effort to make you the pies because it made me happy to see you happy.
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,rainbow dash,Yes!
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,pinkie pie,"And if you're willing to go through all of that, it really shows how much you're willing to do for your friends."
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,rainbow dash,"Aw, shucks. It was nothing."
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,pinkie pie,Now get out of that thing and give me a hug!
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,pinkie pie,"Just remember. In the future, you can always be honest with me."
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,applejack,"Uh, I could've told her that."
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,rainbow dash,[straining] Heh. Cool. H-How about this? Your hugs are too tight.
Secrets and Pies,Josh Hamilton,pinkie pie,"[laughing] No, they're not."
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,starlight glimmer,Oooh! Excuse me. When does the noon train from the Crystal Empire arrive?
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,starlight glimmer,Heh. Right. Sorry. I'm just a little excited because my friend Sunburst is coming.
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,starlight glimmer,"He's my oldest friend. I mean, we've known each other practically forever. We have tons in common."
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,starlight glimmer,"We both love magic and games and jokes <U+0096> everything, really. Now that I think about it, there isn't a pony in all of Equestria I have more in common with."
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,sunburst,Starlight?
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,starlight glimmer,[gasps] Sunburst! You made it!
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,sunburst,Of course! I've been looking forward to this visit for a long time.
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,starlight glimmer,[grunts] Whoa. How long are you staying?
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,sunburst,"Uh, just a... little reading for the train."
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,starlight glimmer,"[chuckles] Same old Sunburst. [grunts] It's going to be so great spending time together. Just like old times. You and me doing the stuff we like <U+0096> games, magic..."
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,sunburst,Antiquing.
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,starlight glimmer,What?
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,sunburst,Antiquing. You know I like antiquing.
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,starlight glimmer,You do?
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,sunburst,"Um, of course! Historical knickknacks, ancient relics... Oh! You are so lucky! Ponyville is antique central!"
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,starlight glimmer,It is?
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,sunburst,"How have we never talked about this? We are going antiquing, and you are gonna love it!"
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,starlight glimmer,Okay. Let's drop your stuff off at the castle first.
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,sunburst,This is so great! Who knew I'd be the one showing you the cool sights of Ponyville?
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,starlight glimmer,I'm a little surprised myself.
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,sunburst,"Wow! What a difference between the hoof-molded bricks and the extruded ones, right?"
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,starlight glimmer,Uh-huh... Ha-ha...
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,sunburst,"Oooh! Check out all these chandeliers! Sometimes, the crystals have magical properties."
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,starlight glimmer,"Oh. Oh, that's cool. How do you<U+0097>?"
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,twilight sparkle,Sunburst! I'm so glad you're here!
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,sunburst,In the antique store?
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,twilight sparkle,"In Ponyville! Starlight's really been looking forward to your visit. Though I'm glad you're in the antique store, too. I'm usually the only one."
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,sunburst,"That's crazy! Who doesn't like antiquing, right?"
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,starlight glimmer,[nervous chuckle] Right.
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,twilight sparkle,"Oooh, look! An ancient map of Equestria made by the Mighty Helm."
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,sunburst,"Without the help of unicorn magic or Pegasus flight, the Earth ponies of the Mighty Helm were able to map the entire coast of Equestria."
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,starlight glimmer,Coooool...
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,sunburst,You don't have to pretend to like all this stuff.
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,starlight glimmer,"What? No! I do like it. I mean, if you like it, I like it. Besides, we've almost looked at everything, right?"
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,twilight sparkle,"Oh, wow! You have got to see this Saddle Arabian vanity!"
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,starlight glimmer,This shop looked a lot smaller from the outside.
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,sunburst,Did you see this Palominian letter opener?
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,twilight sparkle,Wow! That goes well with this ancient phoenix feather quill! We could write to each other!
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,starlight glimmer,"[joins laughter, sighs] Um, I-I really like this old-timey barrel."
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,sunburst,"Actually, the stuff I bought is inside the barrel. But I can't wait to see what it is!"
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,starlight glimmer,Wait. You don't know what you bought?
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,sunburst,"Mm-mmm. It's a blind buy. Sometimes shops get too busy to go through everything, so they load up a box or barrel and sell it without knowing what's inside."
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,twilight sparkle,Buying one is sort of like a treasure hunt.
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,sunburst,Once I found a first edition History of Equestria in the original Olde Ponish.
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,twilight sparkle,Hliet foresettan pliht!
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,sunburst,"It's an Olde Ponish saying. ""Reward prefers risk!"" Uh, it loses something in the translation."
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,twilight sparkle,Why don't we look through this stuff later?
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,sunburst,"Yeah. What do you want to do, Starlight?"
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,starlight glimmer,"Well, I don't know if you're gonna remember this, but..."
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,sunburst,[gasps] Is this...?!
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,starlight glimmer,Dragon Pit!
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,twilight sparkle,I remember that game. You two used to play it?
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,sunburst,Pretty much any time we weren't working on magic. I can't believe you found a copy!
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,starlight glimmer,"Sunburst would get so excited whenever his dragon got trapped, he knocked the whole board over."
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,twilight sparkle,That's adorable.
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,sunburst,"Uh, well, it's an exciting game. But I have a little more control over my horn now."
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,starlight glimmer,Uh-oh! Somepony's dragon's gonna get trapped!
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,twilight sparkle,Doesn't seem so exciting to m<U+0097>
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,sunburst,Huh. I guess it is adorable.
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,starlight glimmer,I hope you're enjoying your visit so far.
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,sunburst,"Are you kidding? I mean, first antiquing and then spending time with Twilight?"
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,starlight glimmer,Oh. Yeah. She's pretty great.
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,sunburst,"Right? I mean, I know she's a princess, but I never thought she'd be so fun to just hang out with."
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,starlight glimmer,"Well, she is the Princess of Friendship."
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,sunburst,[chuckle] Right. I guess that makes sense.
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,starlight glimmer,So tomorrow I thought<U+0097>
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,sunburst,I suppose I'm just surprised at how well we get along. I don't have much in common with most ponies.
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,starlight glimmer,You two are pretty similar. I don't know many ponies who are fluent in Olde Ponish.
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,sunburst,Exactly! I probably have more in common with Twilight than any pony in Equestria!
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,starlight glimmer,Right...
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,sunburst,"[sighs] Anyway, I better get some sleep. [yawns] Ponyville might be small, but there's a lot to do. Maybe we should ask Twilight what she recommends we see!"
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,starlight glimmer,Um... sure.
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,sunburst,"Great! Good night, Starlight."
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,starlight glimmer,Um...
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,starlight glimmer,...Good night.
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,starlight glimmer,"[singsong] Knock, knock!"
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,sunburst,"[yelps] Oh. Hi, Starlight. [yawns] Is it morning already?"
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,starlight glimmer,"Yup! Maybe a bit early, but like you said, there's a lot to see in Ponyville."
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,sunburst,Uh... Right. Okay.
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,starlight glimmer,"Plus, I couldn't really sleep. I just kept thinking about all the stuff we have in common and how much fun we'll have today."
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,sunburst,"Great. Uh, is Twilight up yet?"
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,starlight glimmer,"Actually, I'm pretty sure she's busy with princess stuff today."
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,starlight glimmer,But I've got a full day of stuff planned. Just you and me.
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,sunburst,"Uh, great. Um, would you mind turning around or preferably... leaving the room so I could get changed?"
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,starlight glimmer,One genuine Sweet Apple Acres apple tree! Because we used to drink so much apple juice as foals?
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,sunburst,"Uh, I don't remember that."
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,trixie,[yelps] Ow.
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,starlight glimmer,Trixie? What are you doing here?
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,trixie,"Huh. I often seek the privacy of the orchard to practice new feats of amazement. And also, I fell asleep."
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,starlight glimmer,"Oh. Well, Sunburst and I were just catching up, so<U+0097>"
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,trixie,[gasps] I don't suppose the two of you want to see a never-before-witnessed magical marvel?
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,sunburst,Sure!
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,starlight glimmer,[sighs] Why not?
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,trixie,"Behold, visiting friend from Starlight's past, and be amazed by the Great and Powerful <U+0096> and current best friend of Starlight <U+0096> Trixie!"
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,trixie,I give you... the Unicorn Escape! [grunting] Just... a sec... One more... [grunts] twist... and... [grunts] [straining] The Great and Powerful Trixie requires a little assistance.
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,sunburst,"I know this trick. There's a special link, but I could never hold the chain up long enough to find it."
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,trixie,"Well, if I could do magic like that, I'd have a whole slew of new tricks at my disposal."
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,sunburst,I always liked close-up magic because I knew I could do it if I just practiced enough.
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,trixie,"Starlight, why didn't you tell me how much Sunburst and I had in common?"
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,starlight glimmer,[sarcastic] Gee. I don't know.
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,starlight glimmer,"I know Trixie's ""magic"" is, you know, fun. But the Mirror Pool is actual magic."
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,sunburst,Whoa. This place is pure pony lore.
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,starlight glimmer,"Yup. I mean, it's supposed to be all dangerous, and I guess I shouldn't have broken the seal to get in, but you wanted to see the sights of Ponyville, right?"
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,sunburst,"So, Pinkie Pie just dove in and made copies of herself?"
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,starlight glimmer,"Mm-hmm. If we made copies of ourselves, we could get a year's worth of hanging out over in one day."
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,starlight glimmer,"Uh, not that we would."
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,sunburst,Do you hear that?
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,starlight glimmer,Oh. I hope it's not a leftover Pinkie Pie.
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,maud pie,[deadpan] Not exactly.
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,starlight glimmer,Maud! How did you get in here?
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,maud pie,[deadpan] This cavern's actually connected to mine.
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,sunburst,"Uh, what are you doing?"
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,maud pie,[deadpan] Tapping.
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,starlight glimmer,"Maud isn't super chatty. I mean, you and I could sit around and talk all day, but she looks pretty busy."
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,sunburst,Are you taking some kind of core sample?
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,maud pie,[deadpan] Not exactly. I'm uncovering this section of strata for closer study. You might want to step back.
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,maud pie,[deadpan] I'm studying this area's metamorphic<U+0097>
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,sunburst,"<U+0097>foliation. Is this gneiss, phyllite, or slate? Wow. The pressure above must be pretty uniform to get the planar fabric to be this consistent."
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,maud pie,[deadpan] You know about geology?
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,sunburst,"Eh, I dabble. For example, by the speleothems in this cave, I kind of figured there was another way out."
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,maud pie,[deadpan] Because of the calcite deposits.
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,twilight sparkle,Starlight? Where's Sunburst?
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,starlight glimmer,"[mumbles ""I don't know""] Doing stage magic with Trixie? Studying new rocks with Maud? You're here, so I guess you two aren't off translating some ancient Olde Ponish text."
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,twilight sparkle,What are you talking about? Why would Sunburst be doing any of that? I thought he came to Ponyville to see you.
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,starlight glimmer,"I thought so, too, but it hasn't worked out that way. When we were foals, we had more in common than any two ponies in Equestria. But now, it seems like he's got more in common with my friends than he does with me."
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,twilight sparkle,"Oh. Everypony changes, but that doesn't mean there aren't still things you both like. You both love magic, right?"
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,starlight glimmer,Magic?
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,twilight sparkle,"Sure. You're really good at it, and Sunburst practically knows every spell that ever was."
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,starlight glimmer,"[gasps] You're right! Thanks, Twilight! You're the best!"
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,twilight sparkle,Heh. I try.
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,sunburst,"Starlight, what happened? Maud and I found some fascinating sedimentary stratum, but when I turned to show you, you were gone."
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,starlight glimmer,"Maud does have a way of making rocks really interesting, but I wanted to work on something a little more ""us""."
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,sunburst,What's this?
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,starlight glimmer,Just a little something I made up.
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,sunburst,Whoa! You made up this spell? Just now?
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,starlight glimmer,Yup!
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,sunburst,Wow.
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,starlight glimmer,"I know, right? But wait, there's more!"
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,twilight sparkle,What's going on in here?
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,starlight glimmer,"Nothing. I was trying to have fun doing the one thing I thought we still had in common, but I guess we don't even have that anymore."
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,sunburst,"I don't understand. Starlight and I have known each other since we were foals, but that doesn't mean we have to be foals to hang out."
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,twilight sparkle,"Uh, Starlight does have a tendency to overdo."
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,sunburst,"I mean, it is surprising how well I get along with all of her friends, but she and I still have tons in common."
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,twilight sparkle,Maybe you just need to remind her what those things are.
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,sunburst,"That's it! That's exactly what I'll do! Uh, right after I think of them."
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,twilight sparkle,Uh-oh.
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,trixie,Obviously you and I hit it off. I am quite impressive. And we share a love for prestidigitation.
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,sunburst,"Right. And Starlight and I share a lot of things, too. I just need to think of them. What else do you guys have in common?"
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,trixie,"Well, we've both made not-so-great choices in the past."
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,trixie,"And we're self-conscious about everypony judging us, even though we've both changed and are trying hard to be better."
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,sunburst,"Yeah, we don't really have that."
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,trixie,Hmph! I can think of something you have in common. You're both poor practice audiences.
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,maud pie,[deadpan] Starlight and I don't really have a lot in common. Other than feeling different from most ponies. And comedy.
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,sunburst,Comedy?
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,maud pie,[deadpan] I'm very funny.
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,sunburst,Was that a joke?
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,maud pie,[deadpan] No.
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,sunburst,"Oh. Well, that's more than I can think of that she and I have in common."
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,maud pie,"[deadpan] We don't really spend that much time talking about that, though. Mostly we're just comfortable around each other."
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,sunburst,"[sighs] We used to be. We did everything together. But now I'm wondering if we've spent so much time apart that we don't connect over anything anymore. And if we can't connect over anything, then maybe we're not even friends!"
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,maud pie,"[deadpan] Well, at least it's not serious. That was a joke."
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,starlight glimmer,"[sighs] I appreciate you trying to help, Twilight. But it seems pretty clear that Sunburst and I have grown apart."
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,twilight sparkle,"I understand. But I feel like that only happens if you both let it. You still want to be friends, right?"
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,starlight glimmer,I created a spell so we could relive playing a game in our childhood home... and bodies.
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,twilight sparkle,Right...
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,starlight glimmer,"I'm just not sure Sunburst wants to stay friends, too."
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,twilight sparkle,I think you might be surprised.
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,maud pie,[deadpan] Prepare yourself...
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,trixie,...for the new and improved Dragon Pit!
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,sunburst,"We had to take out a few spaces to get it to fit, but you hardly miss them. Maud made the dice."
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,maud pie,[deadpan] Pumice is the lightest igneous rock. It seemed the best choice.
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,trixie,And I added the special effects. There's nothing like a little well-placed magic smoke.
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,twilight sparkle,Looks like somepony's dragon is going to get trapped.
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,starlight glimmer,I thought you didn't want to play this game.
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,sunburst,"Well, I didn't want to pretend to be a foal, but I know you wanted to play. I thought it'd be fun to play a version big enough for full-grown ponies. What do you think? Fun, right?"
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,starlight glimmer,"Actually, it's missing something."
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,starlight glimmer,[giggles] Now it's fun.
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,starlight glimmer,I don't know why I got so worried about us not having anything in common.
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,sunburst,Yeah. I kind of think it doesn't matter as long as we enjoy each other's company.
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,trixie,And that game was certainly enjoyable.
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,starlight glimmer,What made it even better was getting to play it with all my friends.
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,sunburst,See you soon?
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,starlight glimmer,You bet. I want to hear if you find anything interesting in that barrel.
Uncommon Bond,Josh Haber & Kevin Lappin,sunburst,"Trust me, Starlight. You'll be the first to know."
Shadow Play - Part 1,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,star swirl the bearded,"[narrating] The best elements within us can spread light and virtue, and I know ponies who represent them all <U+0096> strength, bravery, healing, beauty, hope, and sorcery. Myself and these Pillars of Equestria were gathered together by another to maintain and share the light of these powerful ideals. But we soon came to believe the pony who brought us together only wanted that power for himself. Cast out and alone, this power-mad pony turned to darkness to satisfy his thirst. Transformed into a Pony of Shadows, he returned for revenge <U+0096> to extinguish the Pillars' light and rob the world of hope. To stop him, the Pillars and I must make a grave sacrifice. But we shall leave behind a seed in hopes that one day it will grow into a force to stand against the darkness for all time. We must now face the fiend with the only plan we have..."
Shadow Play - Part 1,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,sunburst,"[reading] ""...I only hope it will be enough."" That's the last entry. And maybe Star Swirl's final words before he vanished."
Shadow Play - Part 1,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,princess celestia,"I've always wondered what happened to Star Swirl. This is quite a discovery, Sunburst."
Shadow Play - Part 1,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,So it's genuine? You can verify that this journal really belonged to Star Swirl the Bearded?!
Shadow Play - Part 1,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,princess luna,"Indeed. From the looks of it, the last thing he wrote before facing the Pony of Shadows."
Shadow Play - Part 1,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,rainbow dash,"Uh... So, the Pony of Shadows was really real?"
Shadow Play - Part 1,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,princess celestia,It appears so.
Shadow Play - Part 1,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,princess luna,"We never met the other Pillars, and we were too young to understand the danger they faced."
Shadow Play - Part 1,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,applejack,"Hold on a second now. All those legendary ponies were real, too? And they went off with Star Swirl to face the Pony of Shadows, and then none of them were ever heard from again?"
Shadow Play - Part 1,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,pinkie pie,"Uh, yeah. Weren't you listening?"
Shadow Play - Part 1,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,fluttershy,But what happened to them all?
Shadow Play - Part 1,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,rarity,"They must have defeated the villain, since Equestria is still full of light and hope."
Shadow Play - Part 1,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,But how? And where did they go?
Shadow Play - Part 1,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,princess celestia,"My Olde Ponish is a bit rusty, but I wonder if the answers can be found somewhere within the pages of this book."
Shadow Play - Part 1,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"Well, I just happen to be an expert in Olde Ponish. I mean, I've practically memorized every ancient text about Star Swirl there is!"
Shadow Play - Part 1,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,spike,Seriously. All of them.
Shadow Play - Part 1,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,princess luna,"We have fond memories of our old teacher. If you could discover what happened to him, we would be most grateful."
Shadow Play - Part 1,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,sunburst,Solving a thousands-year-old mystery could take forever! Think of the research! The re-reading! The re-re-reading!
Shadow Play - Part 1,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,princess celestia,You might find you need help.
Shadow Play - Part 1,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,applejack,"Luckily, she's got a whole bushel o' helpers right here."
Shadow Play - Part 1,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,rainbow dash,"Totally! Uh... how long will all this research take, exactly?"
Shadow Play - Part 1,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,Let's get this back to my library. I'm sure we'll figure out what happened in no time.
Shadow Play - Part 1,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,spike,"[yawns] Figure it out yet, Twilight?"
Shadow Play - Part 1,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,sunburst,[yelps] What did you figure out?
Shadow Play - Part 1,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,fluttershy,What is it?
Shadow Play - Part 1,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,applejack,"Twilight, we've been studyin' and referencin' and cross-referencin' for three days straight now."
Shadow Play - Part 1,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,rainbow dash,Ugh. I haven't spent this much time reading since the last Daring Do book came out.
Shadow Play - Part 1,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,rarity,"Perhaps it is time to take a break. This mystery is over a thousand years old, after all. Another day or two won't make a difference."
Shadow Play - Part 1,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,Two days?! I don't want to waste two seconds! I'm close to an answer. I can feel it.
Shadow Play - Part 1,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,"[reading] ""Hearg sylfum se Ponhenge"". What's that?"
Shadow Play - Part 1,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,The Temple of Ponhenge?! You can read that?!
Shadow Play - Part 1,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,"The hornwriting's pretty sloppy, but it's nowhere near as bad as mine. [reading] ""Toward dol grimlic of Fola Firgenbeorg""?"
Shadow Play - Part 1,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,sunburst,"""At the base of Foal Mountain""..."

Shadow Play - Part 1,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"[gasps] ""Our last stand""."
Shadow Play - Part 1,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,This is it. Ponhenge. I can't believe it.
Shadow Play - Part 1,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,sunburst,I've never seen magical runes like these before! Have you?
Shadow Play - Part 1,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,Uh-uh.
Shadow Play - Part 1,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,rainbow dash,I don't think anypony's seen any of this for a long time. [straining] Whoa!
Shadow Play - Part 1,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,applejack,It'd take a whole team of ponies to clear away all this brush.
Shadow Play - Part 1,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,fluttershy,"Even then, I'm not sure we'd find out what happened here over a thousand years ago."
Shadow Play - Part 1,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,[sighs] You're right. I suppose it was a long shot.
Shadow Play - Part 1,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,spike,"Cheer up, Twilight. Finding a whole set of ancient ruins is pretty impressive. Maybe you could write a paper on it."
Shadow Play - Part 1,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,I guess I hoped we'd get here and the mystery would just magically be explained.
Shadow Play - Part 1,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,spike,Uh... Twilight?
Shadow Play - Part 1,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,Star Swirl!? I... I've wanted to meet you my whole life! I can't believe you're here!
Shadow Play - Part 1,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,sunburst,I don't think he is here. I don't think any of them are.
Shadow Play - Part 1,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,star swirl the bearded,We did not come here to defeat you.
Shadow Play - Part 1,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,star swirl the bearded,We came... to contain you.
Shadow Play - Part 1,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,pinkie pie,"[to Twilight] Well, you did ask for a magical explanation."
Shadow Play - Part 1,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,rainbow dash,Uh... what just happened?
Shadow Play - Part 1,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,It looked like Star Swirl cast a spell that banished the Pony of Shadows.
Shadow Play - Part 1,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,sunburst,Of course! Powerful magic like that would leave an impression on this place. Bringing the book back here let us see what happened.
Shadow Play - Part 1,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,applejack,Which was what?
Shadow Play - Part 1,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,Star Swirl and the rest of the Pillars sacrificed themselves to save Equestria.
Shadow Play - Part 1,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,It's amazing to think one of the greatest mysteries of Equestria was solved with a musty old book from an antique shop.
Shadow Play - Part 1,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,sunburst,But I wouldn't say the mystery's solved. Star Swirl's spell was one of the most powerful feats of magic in all of history. It'll take years of study before we fully understand it.
Shadow Play - Part 1,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,I think I understand Star Swirl's spell!
Shadow Play - Part 1,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"I know I've finished one of Star Swirl's spells before, but this one was on a whole different level! Was it an explosion of magical feedback? An evocation? A kind of incantation? It's Star Swirl, so the possibilities are endless! And once Starlight set me on the right track with his crazy hornwriting <U+0096> [laughs, snorts] I mean, he was a genius, so I guess we can forgive a little messiness <U+0096> I went through the journal again, and it's amazing!"
Shadow Play - Part 1,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,rarity,"Twilight, darling. We understand you're excited, but that's all we understand."
Shadow Play - Part 1,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,rainbow dash,What exactly is so amazing?
Shadow Play - Part 1,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,Only how Star Swirl and the other Pillars sent the Pony of Shadows to limbo!
Shadow Play - Part 1,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,applejack,They did what now?
Shadow Play - Part 1,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,They used their magic to open a portal between worlds <U+0096> to limbo <U+0096> and pulled the Pony of Shadows inside.
Shadow Play - Part 1,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,rarity,"Darling, your diorama!"
Shadow Play - Part 1,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,I made more!
Shadow Play - Part 1,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,Star Swirl thought the only way to trap the Pony of Shadows in limbo was for the Pillars to take him there.
Shadow Play - Part 1,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,applejack,"So they got stuck, too!"
Shadow Play - Part 1,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,fluttershy,The Pony of Shadows must have been really awful for them to do that.
Shadow Play - Part 1,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,pinkie pie,"I suppose being trapped for all time with a super-duper bad guy in limbo might be okay if you were doing the limbo, but that's still pushing it."
Shadow Play - Part 1,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"The thing is, I think I can get them out."
Shadow Play - Part 1,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,sunburst,"Twilight, are you serious? You can save the most legendary ponies of all time?"
Shadow Play - Part 1,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,I-I don't know. Opening portals between worlds didn't work out well for me. Are you sure it's safe?
Shadow Play - Part 1,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"First of all, you opened portals through time. And second of all, Star Swirl wrote the spell you used to do it. If he'd been here, he could have stopped it. Equestria would be safer with him in it. We have to save him."
Shadow Play - Part 1,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,applejack,"But you'd be savin' all the Pillars, right? A-And they disappeared ages ago."
Shadow Play - Part 1,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"That's the thing about limbo. It isn't one place or another. It's in between, so time stands still. If we can pull them out, it'll be like they never left. I actually built another model to demonstrate<U+0097>"
Shadow Play - Part 1,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,spike,What can we do to help?
Shadow Play - Part 1,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"If I'm right, we need to find items that are connected to the Pillars in some way."
Shadow Play - Part 1,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,rainbow dash,"You mean, like, stuff that belonged to them?"
Shadow Play - Part 1,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,fluttershy,How would we know what to look for? Or where?
Shadow Play - Part 1,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"Luckily, Star Swirl took a lot of notes. [reading] ""My compatriots are as varied as the realm itself and hail from every corner of our land, bringing with them artifacts and talismans of great power."""
Shadow Play - Part 1,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,"Um, Twilight? What are you doing?"
Shadow Play - Part 1,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,I'm not doing anything!
Shadow Play - Part 1,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,applejack,Rockhoof's shovel!
Shadow Play - Part 1,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,rainbow dash,Flash Magnus' shield!
Shadow Play - Part 1,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,rarity,Mistmane's flower!
Shadow Play - Part 1,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,fluttershy,Meadowbrook's mask!
Shadow Play - Part 1,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,pinkie pie,And the blindfold Somnambula wore when she faced that nasty sphinx!
Shadow Play - Part 1,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,I guess we don't need to figure out who should get what.
Shadow Play - Part 1,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,applejack,"Oh, I can guarantee Rockhoof was as real as you and me."
Shadow Play - Part 1,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,applejack,Probably.
Shadow Play - Part 1,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,applejack,"I bet if you told somepony else the story, it might sound... [gasps] ""preposterous""."
Shadow Play - Part 1,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,rarity,Ow!
Shadow Play - Part 1,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,rarity,Perhaps it just seemed like your gardens were worthless. But a little pruning can work wonders. Of course you will have to look after more than just one flower now.
Shadow Play - Part 1,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,rainbow dash,I can't believe Flash Magnus' shield ended up in the Dragon Lands.
Shadow Play - Part 1,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,spike,Good thing you brought the official Equestrian friendship ambassador to the dragons to help you navigate our customs. Like our favorite sport <U+0096> gorge surfing!
Shadow Play - Part 1,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,rainbow dash,Okay. That was awesome.
Shadow Play - Part 1,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,spike,"Whoa, fellas. As the official Equestrian friendship ambassador to the dragons, I have to say that's not very friendly."
Shadow Play - Part 1,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,garble,"Well, what do you know? The puny pony-dragon's sticking up for his pony pal."
Shadow Play - Part 1,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,rainbow dash,Hey! That's an ancient pony artifact!
Shadow Play - Part 1,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,garble,"Hooves off my gorge board! I found it in the desert, and finders keepers."
Shadow Play - Part 1,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,rainbow dash,It isn't yours.
Shadow Play - Part 1,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,garble,Huh. It sure looks like mine. But I might consider racing you for it.
Shadow Play - Part 1,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,rainbow dash,No problem.
Shadow Play - Part 1,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,garble,Um... No. I mean [to Spike] you.
Shadow Play - Part 1,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,spike,"Whoa! Whoa! Whoooooaaaaa! Aaah! [grunting] [painting] I won? I won! Woo-hoo! Give up the shield, Garble!"
Shadow Play - Part 1,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,garble,[grunts] Lord Ember only commanded us to be nice to ponies. She never said anything about pony-loving dragons.
Shadow Play - Part 1,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,spike,"Uh, s-since Dragon Lord Ember commanded you to make peace with ponies, you can't very well attack one of their friends, can you?"
Shadow Play - Part 1,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,garble,I guess we'll find out! [grunts] Aaah!
Shadow Play - Part 1,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,garble,Ugh. Why is he always hiding behind ponies?
Shadow Play - Part 1,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,spike,I wasn't hiding when I beat you down the ridge.
Shadow Play - Part 1,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,garble,You fell.
Shadow Play - Part 1,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,rainbow dash,Wow. You must be slow if all Spike had to do to win was fall down.
Shadow Play - Part 1,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,garble,I'm faster than you.
Shadow Play - Part 1,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,rainbow dash,Doubt it.
Shadow Play - Part 1,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,garble,"Fine! I'll race you back to the top. If you win, you can have your pony junk. But if I win, you'll leave and I get to give it to him!"
Shadow Play - Part 1,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,rainbow dash,"Fine. I'm pretty sure I could beat you anyway. But with that heavy hunk of metal on your back, it'll be a snap."
Shadow Play - Part 1,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,garble,"Huh? Oh, yeah. Thanks for the tip."
Shadow Play - Part 1,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,garble,"See ya at the top, loser! Hey! That's mine!"
Shadow Play - Part 1,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,spike,"Finders keepers, remember?"
Shadow Play - Part 1,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,fluttershy,"Just remember not to turn away from them, Cattail. Flash bees can get pretty aggressive. I guess that's why none of the other bayou animals can get to the water."
Shadow Play - Part 1,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,fluttershy,It would... if I didn't have to fly up here to move their hive. There!
Shadow Play - Part 1,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,fluttershy,Now the other bayou creatures can get to the water without the bees feeling threatened.
Shadow Play - Part 1,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,fluttershy,I know. [giggles] But I couldn't leave without helping.
Shadow Play - Part 1,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,daring do,I wouldn't give up hope just yet.
Shadow Play - Part 1,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,pinkie pie,This old blindfold was stuck in the drain.
Shadow Play - Part 1,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,daring do,Weren't you looking for a blindfold?
Shadow Play - Part 1,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,pinkie pie,"Oh, yeah!"
Shadow Play - Part 1,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"I can't believe I'm gonna meet Star Swirl the Bearded! You know, outside of my dreams."
Shadow Play - Part 1,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,I can't believe you're actually going through with it.
Shadow Play - Part 1,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,What do you mean?
Shadow Play - Part 1,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,"I'm all for pushing the envelope, obviously, but this is pretty out there for you, Twilight."
Shadow Play - Part 1,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,sunburst,"What's ""out there"" about saving the most legendary ponies of all time from a thousands-year-old prison?"
Shadow Play - Part 1,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,"Well... nothing when you say it like that. Unless ""the most legendary ponies of all time"" knew what they were doing, and we shouldn't mess with it."
Shadow Play - Part 1,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,sunburst,"I'm sure Star Swirl and the Pillars did the best they could back then, but magic has come a long way. Mostly because of the work they did."
Shadow Play - Part 1,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,That's true. And you did get your wings from finishing one of Star Swirl's spells.
Shadow Play - Part 1,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,Exactly.
Shadow Play - Part 1,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,"But then I messed with one and nearly destroyed the universe, so..."
Shadow Play - Part 1,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"Starlight, Star Swirl the Bearded is the greatest wizard who ever lived. The chance to have him back in Equestria is worth the risk."
Shadow Play - Part 1,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,spike,That's good news.
Shadow Play - Part 1,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,rainbow dash,"Otherwise, we'd have brought this shield for nothing."
Shadow Play - Part 1,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,applejack,"I hope you don't think you're the only one to find her artifact, because this here shovel says otherwise."
Shadow Play - Part 1,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,rarity,"[laughing] Honestly, you two. Not everything is a competition. But Mistmane's flower is by far the most attractive of the artifacts."
Shadow Play - Part 1,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,pinkie pie,You're just saying that because you didn't have to scuba dive in a pit of green slime to get yours!
Shadow Play - Part 1,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,fluttershy,Or move a flash beehive.
Shadow Play - Part 1,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"Good work, everyone. Let's do this!"
Shadow Play - Part 1,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,star swirl the bearded,What... What has happened?
Shadow Play - Part 1,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,It worked! We brought you back!
Shadow Play - Part 1,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,star swirl the bearded,To where?
Shadow Play - Part 1,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"You and the others have been trapped in limbo for over a thousand years, but I figured out how to get you ho<U+0097>"
Shadow Play - Part 1,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,star swirl the bearded,"What?! No, no, no, no! You must undo what you've done!"
Shadow Play - Part 1,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"What? Why? I mean, I don't think I can."
Shadow Play - Part 1,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,star swirl the bearded,You cannot bring us back!
Shadow Play - Part 1,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,But I did. I brought all the Pillars back.
Shadow Play - Part 1,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,star swirl the bearded,You cannot bring only the Pillars back!
Shadow Play - Part 1,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"Oh, no!"
Shadow Play - Part 2,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,sunburst,That's the last entry. Star Swirl's final words before he vanished.
Shadow Play - Part 2,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,applejack,"All those legendary ponies were real, too? And then none of them were ever heard from again?"
Shadow Play - Part 2,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,They used their magic to open a portal to limbo.
Shadow Play - Part 2,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,We need to find items that are connected to the Pillars in some way.
Shadow Play - Part 2,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,We brought you back!
Shadow Play - Part 2,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,star swirl the bearded,You cannot bring only the Pillars back!
Shadow Play - Part 2,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,star swirl the bearded,You must return us to limbo. It's the only way to stop him.
Shadow Play - Part 2,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,I only figured out how to bring you back.
Shadow Play - Part 2,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,sunburst,Working on it! No table of contents!
Shadow Play - Part 2,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,star swirl the bearded,You have studied my writings. Surely you have some other plan.
Shadow Play - Part 2,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,No. I just wanted to save you. I didn't think<U+0097>
Shadow Play - Part 2,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,No!
Shadow Play - Part 2,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,"Lucky for her, she's not alone!"
Shadow Play - Part 2,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,star swirl the bearded,"Know this, fiend! We will not rest until we find a way to return you to limbo!"
Shadow Play - Part 2,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,rainbow dash,Um... where'd he go?
Shadow Play - Part 2,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,fluttershy,Over a thousand years.
Shadow Play - Part 2,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,star swirl the bearded,Then my spell worked <U+0096> before it was meddled with <U+0096> and the realm has been at peace for a millennia!
Shadow Play - Part 2,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,pinkie pie,"Weeeeell... we did have to save everypony from Nightmare Moon and Discord and Chrysalis and King Sombra and Lord Tirek, and there was that one time when Starlight traveled through time and almost destroyed life as we know it! But that's all in the past."
Shadow Play - Part 2,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,star swirl the bearded,We shall see. It is an easy thing to say you have saved the world. It is quite another to do it.
Shadow Play - Part 2,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,rainbow dash,"Oh, we've saved the world, Beardo. And we can do it again."
Shadow Play - Part 2,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,star swirl the bearded,"Be that as it may, the problem of locating the Pony of Shadows remains, and this land is vast."
Shadow Play - Part 2,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,rarity,"It sounds like you need a map. Luckily, we have just the thing."
Shadow Play - Part 2,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,star swirl the bearded,Something about this magic seems familiar...
Shadow Play - Part 2,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,rarity,Did you know he can do that?
Shadow Play - Part 2,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,He's Star Swirl! He can do anything!
Shadow Play - Part 2,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,star swirl the bearded,"This map, and indeed this very castle, are grown from the seed we planted over a thousand years ago."
Shadow Play - Part 2,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,rockhoof,Then it did work!
Shadow Play - Part 2,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,sunburst,What worked?
Shadow Play - Part 2,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,applejack,Y'all mean the Elements came from you?
Shadow Play - Part 2,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,pinkie pie,"You know, the sparkly crystal things that grow from the Tree of Harmony and represent each of us? Laughter, honesty, generosity, loyalty, kindness, and magic!"
Shadow Play - Part 2,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,star swirl the bearded,"More importantly, we no longer need Ponhenge to send our foe back to limbo. We can use the stored magic in this Tree of Harmony."
Shadow Play - Part 2,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,But doesn't a banishing spell take a lot of power? We'd have to sacrifice the Elements for that.
Shadow Play - Part 2,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,star swirl the bearded,Mm-hmm.
Shadow Play - Part 2,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,fluttershy,They'd be gone... forever?
Shadow Play - Part 2,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"Star Swirl, I don't think the Tree can survive without the Elements. If it dies, Equestria will suffer."
Shadow Play - Part 2,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,star swirl the bearded,"If the Pony of Shadows has his way, your land will not exist. So unless you have a better idea..."
Shadow Play - Part 2,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,star swirl the bearded,Our foe will seek dark places from which to draw power. I will prepare my spell so that we may strike as soon as you find him.
Shadow Play - Part 2,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,rainbow dash,What are we waiting for?
Shadow Play - Part 2,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,spike,What about this one?
Shadow Play - Part 2,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"Seapony etiquette isn't going to help right now, Spike."
Shadow Play - Part 2,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,"Uh, Twilight? Are you okay?"
Shadow Play - Part 2,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,I just unleashed ultimate evil and doomed Equestria because I was obsessed with meeting my idol! Why wouldn't I be okay?!
Shadow Play - Part 2,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,[scoffs] You didn't know that was gonna happen.
Shadow Play - Part 2,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,But I should have listened to you and left things alone. Now the Elements of Harmony will be lost to fix my mistake!
Shadow Play - Part 2,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,Maybe there's another way.
Shadow Play - Part 2,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,spike,"If there is, Twilight will find it."
Shadow Play - Part 2,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"Portal gate... Portal keys... Portal spells... Yes! If the Pillars can hold open the gateway to limbo, a powerful pony can do the banishing spell herself! Do you know what this means?"
Shadow Play - Part 2,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,spike,[panting] I can stop carrying books?
Shadow Play - Part 2,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"The Pillars don't have to leave Equestria! Even though we'll lose the Elements, we'll have the ponies that created them. And the Pony of Shadows will be banished for good!"
Shadow Play - Part 2,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,That's great. Heh. But I was thinking of another way that maybe doesn't involve banishing at all?
Shadow Play - Part 2,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"Star Swirl knew what he was doing when he cast that spell. If I can make it even better, maybe he'll see that I take magic as seriously as he does."
Shadow Play - Part 2,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,rockhoof,It seems the dark places Star Swirl indicated on the map have changed.
Shadow Play - Part 2,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,applejack,I bet the Pony of Shadows would've loved the Ghastly Caverns before a thousand years of erosion turned it into the Ghastly Gorge.
Shadow Play - Part 2,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,fluttershy,The Appeloosian Wastes sure sounded dark and desolate.
Shadow Play - Part 2,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,rarity,Who knew they would become such a popular square dancing destination?
Shadow Play - Part 2,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,pinkie pie,And I get how this part of Equestria used to be cast in eternal night where the Pony of Shadows could draw power and wreak havoc while ponies were powerless to stop him. But...
Shadow Play - Part 2,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,pinkie pie,[echoing] ...it's kinda made a comeback! Did I mention it's really bright?!
Shadow Play - Part 2,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,star swirl the bearded,It seems there are fewer dark corners in the realm these days.
Shadow Play - Part 2,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,rainbow dash,Isn't that a good thing?
Shadow Play - Part 2,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,fluttershy,Isn't there some way to banish him without losing all of you?
Shadow Play - Part 2,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"I don't think you'll have to! My spell isn't finished yet, but I think we can send the Pony of Shadows to limbo without all of you having to go as well!"
Shadow Play - Part 2,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,star swirl the bearded,"While I appreciate your enthusiasm, Twilight, this is hardly the time to take risks on half-baked spells."
Shadow Play - Part 2,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,applejack,"Beggin' your pardon, Mr. the Bearded! But Twilight doesn't do anythin' halfway!"
Shadow Play - Part 2,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,pinkie pie,Especially not magic!
Shadow Play - Part 2,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,rainbow dash,Seriously! She got her wings by finishing one of your spells!
Shadow Play - Part 2,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,rarity,I think you'll find her work is worth reading before you dismiss it out of hoof!
Shadow Play - Part 2,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,fluttershy,Mm-hmm!
Shadow Play - Part 2,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,star swirl the bearded,Hmm. I suppose there is a chance.
Shadow Play - Part 2,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,sunburst,But we still have no idea where to find the villain.
Shadow Play - Part 2,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,spike,Maybe we should try there?
Shadow Play - Part 2,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,applejack,The Hollow Shades. I think a branch of the Apple family lives there.
Shadow Play - Part 2,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,sunburst,They'd have to be pretty distant. The Hollow Shades was abandoned eons ago.
Shadow Play - Part 2,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,rarity,"Hmm, that's odd. The only time the map's called all of us to one place was Starlight's village."
Shadow Play - Part 2,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,rainbow dash,So it's like a super-villain tracker! No offense.
Shadow Play - Part 2,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,Do you think the map could be trying to tell us where the Pony of Shadows is?
Shadow Play - Part 2,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,star swirl the bearded,"Hmm... The Tree of Harmony acting to protect the light of the realm... Yes. A good thought, Twilight."
Shadow Play - Part 2,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,star swirl the bearded,I will make my notes on this spell. Ready yourselves for battle.
Shadow Play - Part 2,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,"Uh, I know I'm not as experienced as all of you, but is banishment really the only option? I mean, it's been a long time. Maybe the Pony of Shadows is ready to talk?"
Shadow Play - Part 2,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,star swirl the bearded,I doubt we can save our homeland with a conversation.
Shadow Play - Part 2,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,But we could try.
Shadow Play - Part 2,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"Starlight, I'm sure Star Swirl and the others did try."
Shadow Play - Part 2,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,star swirl the bearded,"The Pony of Shadows was not interested in reconciliation. Once a villain, always a villain. Twilight, Sunburst, would you accompany me? I wish to refine this spell for our use."
Shadow Play - Part 2,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,rockhoof,Come. We must prepare for the struggle ahead.
Shadow Play - Part 2,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,"[sighs] I know Star Swirl is a great wizard, but this whole plan seems... wrong. The map's only ever sent us to solve friendship problems."
Shadow Play - Part 2,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,spike,"Maybe so, but the Pony of Shadows doesn't really seem like the ""friendship"" type."
Shadow Play - Part 2,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,Honestly? We don't know anything about him.
Shadow Play - Part 2,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,spike,"Well, nopony does."
Shadow Play - Part 2,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,That's not entirely true.
Shadow Play - Part 2,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,You all knew the Pony of Shadows before he became what he is now. You must've been friends. So what happened?
Shadow Play - Part 2,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,rockhoof,The tale of our rift is a sad one.
Shadow Play - Part 2,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,rockhoof,"[narrating] Stygian was a pony like the rest of us, though more scholar than hero. He recognized our emerging world would need champions to defend it."
Shadow Play - Part 2,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,But why did he steal the artifacts from you?
Shadow Play - Part 2,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,Hmm...
Shadow Play - Part 2,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,That looks like a lot of work.
Shadow Play - Part 2,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,star swirl the bearded,"It is what must be done, and it would be best if we were not disturbed."
Shadow Play - Part 2,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"I'm sorry, Starlight, but we can't stop to talk. The stakes are too high, and we have to<U+0097>"
Shadow Play - Part 2,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,Banish Stygian to limbo. I get it.
Shadow Play - Part 2,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,sunburst,"Uh, who?"
Shadow Play - Part 2,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,star swirl the bearded,Stygian was the name the Pony of Shadows gave up when he turned to darkness.
Shadow Play - Part 2,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,And I'm just trying to figure out why.
Shadow Play - Part 2,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,star swirl the bearded,"Envy. He wanted more power than he had, and that desire led him down a path from which there is no return!"
Shadow Play - Part 2,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,"I know from experience that's not always true. When the map called you six to my village, it was for a friendship problem. Are you sure this is different?"
Shadow Play - Part 2,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,I...
Shadow Play - Part 2,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,star swirl the bearded,Stygian wants to destroy all that is good in this world. There's no way to befriend a pony like that.
Shadow Play - Part 2,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,"I guess I'm lucky your idol wasn't around when you decided to be my friend. I might've been banished to limbo, too."
Shadow Play - Part 2,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,star swirl the bearded,"A necessary sacrifice. With the Elements' power, we will bind the Pony of Shadows in limbo. And thanks to Twilight, we will remain to watch over the realm ourselves."
Shadow Play - Part 2,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,rockhoof,Um... how do we use them?
Shadow Play - Part 2,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,rarity,"Well, you... Oh. I'm not sure. They simply work for us."
Shadow Play - Part 2,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,star swirl the bearded,The Elements are attuned to you. We must use their magic in pairs.
Shadow Play - Part 2,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,rainbow dash,No problem. We're used to banishing evil before breakfast.
Shadow Play - Part 2,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,applejack,And it'll be an honor to save Equestria with y'all.
Shadow Play - Part 2,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,I really hope Twilight knows what she's doing...
Shadow Play - Part 2,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,sunburst,I don't remember reading anything that said the Hollow Shades was like this.
Shadow Play - Part 2,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,star swirl the bearded,Prepare yourselves. He is here. Stygian! Show yourself and face us!
Shadow Play - Part 2,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,sunburst,[groans] I definitely would've remembered reading about this.
Shadow Play - Part 2,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,star swirl the bearded,We did what we had to do. You tried to steal our powers for yourself.
Shadow Play - Part 2,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,Are you still sure this isn't a friendship problem?
Shadow Play - Part 2,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,star swirl the bearded,Ready? Open the portal...
Shadow Play - Part 2,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,star swirl the bearded,...Now!
Shadow Play - Part 2,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,star swirl the bearded,Twilight! Push him in!
Shadow Play - Part 2,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,Huh? There's... a pony in there.
Shadow Play - Part 2,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,Are you... Stygian?
Shadow Play - Part 2,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,But Star Swirl says you betrayed them. You wanted their magic...
Shadow Play - Part 2,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"This is all a misunderstanding! If the Pillars knew how you felt, I'm sure they wouldn't have turned their backs on you. The shadow isn't who you really are. Let me help you be Stygian again."
Shadow Play - Part 2,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,"Because it's what she does. I wasn't so different from you, and Twilight helped me change. If there's one pony in Equestria that can save a friendship, it's her."
Shadow Play - Part 2,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"Fight the darkness, Stygian! You don't need it anymore! Revenge isn't what you want! Friendship is!"
Shadow Play - Part 2,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,Twilight!
Shadow Play - Part 2,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"Ugh! The shadow won't let go of him. He wants to stop, but he can't do it alone."
Shadow Play - Part 2,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,star swirl the bearded,Then we must help him!
Shadow Play - Part 2,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,rainbow dash,"Yeah! Oh, it felt sooooo good to do that again!"
Shadow Play - Part 2,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,pinkie pie,Friendship power rush! Whoo!
Shadow Play - Part 2,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,rarity,The Elements! They didn't disappear!
Shadow Play - Part 2,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,fluttershy,Maybe because we used them for healing magic instead of banishing?
Shadow Play - Part 2,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,applejack,Look!
Shadow Play - Part 2,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,star swirl the bearded,"Long ago, you needed our help, Stygian. But instead of listening, we turned our backs on you. Pride clouded my judgment. I owe you an apology. Thank you for helping us see the errors of our ways, Twilight. It seems I never accounted for the Magic of Friendship."
Shadow Play - Part 2,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"Thank you, Swirlstar! Uh, Star Swirl!"
Shadow Play - Part 2,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,[clears throat] Soooo... apparently a conversation can save Equestria?
Shadow Play - Part 2,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,star swirl the bearded,[chuckles] Something tells me I will be making a lot of apologies today.
Shadow Play - Part 2,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,star swirl the bearded,I simply cannot believe how tall you've gotten!
Shadow Play - Part 2,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,princess celestia,"Well, it has been over a thousand years. Will you stay here and teach magic once again? My sister and I have such fond memories of your lessons."
Shadow Play - Part 2,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,princess luna,As long as you don't ask for those essays we owed you before you disappeared.
Shadow Play - Part 2,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,star swirl the bearded,"[chuckles] I'm not certain Canterlot is where I belong. The realm has grown, and I believe I'll have a look around before I settle in any one place."
Shadow Play - Part 2,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,princess celestia,Then I hope you will return to Canterlot on occasion and share the wisdom of your great experience with the next generation of ponies.
Shadow Play - Part 2,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,star swirl the bearded,"We would be honored. But if it is wisdom you seek, look no further than your own pupil. She showed me that the power of friendship is a magical force indeed. And that in turning away from others, you hurt yourself as well."
Shadow Play - Part 2,Josh Haber & Nicole Dubuc; story by Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"It's funny. I thought meeting my idol would give me all the answers I ever wanted. But instead, I forgot what I already knew. Good thing I had a student of my own to remind me."
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,twilight sparkle,This happened while we were gone?
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,applejack,Wow! Those are all the places we went when we left to save Equestria!
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,rarity,Ugh! There's that horrid town where we were almost sold!
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,rainbow dash,"The pirates! They were pretty awesome! Uh, once they decided not to throw us overboard."
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,pinkie pie,"And Mount Aris! Ooh, Starlight! Did you know we made seashell necklaces for aaaaaa... [inhales] ...aaaaall the seaponies?"
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,starlight glimmer,I... You... Really? What about that unicorn? The one who attacked Canterlot?
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,twilight sparkle,"Tempest! I invited her to come to Ponyville, but she wanted to spread the word of the Storm King's defeat and share what she learned about friendship."
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,applejack,Y'all think that's why the map grew? Friendship quests beyond Equestria?
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,fluttershy,"I hope not. I've had quite enough life-threatening adventures, thank you very much."
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,pinkie pie,How many friendship quests do you think we need to go on before we have to expand the throne room?
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,twilight sparkle,We can't do it all alone.
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,pinkie pie,"Sure we can! We just need to knock this wall down, get some paint..."
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,twilight sparkle,"No. I mean, the world is filled with so many different creatures who know nothing about friendship. We need help if we're gonna teach them all about friendship. Lots of help."
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,rarity,Perhaps. But where does one go to learn about friendship?
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,twilight sparkle,Here! They can all go here! Because we're gonna open a school!
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,princess celestia,"I think a school of friendship is a wonderful idea, Twilight! I'll help in any way I can."
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,twilight sparkle,I just have a few questions. What time should school start each day?
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,princess celestia,It really d<U+0097>
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,twilight sparkle,What's the ideal length for class? Do you test regularly?
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,princess celestia,"Oh, well, that's<U+0097>"
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,twilight sparkle,What about class projects?
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,princess celestia,That's a very<U+0097>
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,twilight sparkle,Assigned seating? Open seating? Or is that... too unstructured?
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,princess celestia,"[giggles] Oh, Twilight. You were my star pupil. If anyone knows how to run a school, it's you."
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,twilight sparkle,There's a big difference between attending a school and running one. It's not like there's a rule book to follow.
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,princess celestia,"Actually, there is. The EEA guidebook is very specific about how to run a school."
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,twilight sparkle,The EEA? I've never heard of that. Should I have heard of that?!
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,princess celestia,Of course not. You've never run a school before. The Equestria Education Association is a board of learned ponies that oversee every school in Equestria.
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,spike,Even your school? But you're you!
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,princess celestia,"Not even a princess can do whatever she likes when it comes to shaping young pony minds. The EEA ensures that whether it's unicorns studying magic, Pegasi learning weather, or Earth ponies researching agriculture, all schools are held to the same high standard. They'll need to approve your plan before you can move forward."
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,twilight sparkle,"Okay, Spike, looks like we have a presentation to make."
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,spike,"[scoffs] After everything we've been through, how hard can that be?"
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,spike,"I'm gonna go with ""really hard""."
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,twilight sparkle,"Uh, hello. My name is<U+0097>"
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,neighsay,"Princess Twilight Sparkle. I am Chancellor Neighsay. Equestria owes you a great debt. But princess or no, we expect you to do things by... the... book!"
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,twilight sparkle,"I think you'll find my curriculum meets all your requirements, Chancellor."
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,neighsay,"And can we trust you to follow through with this plan? Will you leave the school unattended to gallop off on your... ""adventures""?"
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,twilight sparkle,My journey beyond Equestria showed me firsthoof that the threats out there are greater than we imagined!
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,twilight sparkle,"If we want to keep our land safe and create a friendlier tomorrow, we need to teach the Magic of Friendship far and wide."
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,neighsay,A school for ponies to learn how to protect themselves.
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,twilight sparkle,"Uh, more like respecting differences and communicating."
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,neighsay,"The EEA concurs. Every pony should be prepared to defend our way of life. So, if your work is in order, provisional EEA approval is granted. We will need to observe your school up and running before it can be fully accredited."
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,twilight sparkle,"Then please, join us for Friends and Family Day. It'll be the perfect time to see our progress!"
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,rainbow dash,It's too much. Too much!
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,rarity,"Ugh, you think so? I had hoped dressing the part would help me feel the part."
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,rainbow dash,Not your dress! This! Us! Teaching?! They're gonna think I'm an egghead!
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,pinkie pie,"Well, the students are gonna love my confetti cannon class. It's gonna be... a blast!"
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,fluttershy,"Um, hello there. I'm your teacher. I hope you enjoy class. But if you don't enjoy it, that's okay, too."
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,applejack,I don't know about all this.
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,twilight sparkle,It's going to be fine. Everything about this school just feels right.
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,starlight glimmer,"See? If Twilight isn't stressed, you've got nothing to worry about."
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,applejack,And you're sure you want us to be teachers? In classrooms?
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,twilight sparkle,"The EEA is very clear on how schools should be run. We have a huge responsibility, and I need you all to do this by the book. That means no cannons in class, Pinkie."
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,pinkie pie,Awww. Not even a [high-pitched] teeny cannon?
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,twilight sparkle,"I know it's not some big adventure against the forces of evil, but this could be the most important thing we've ever done. I can't run a school of friendship without my best friends. Can I count on you?"
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,rarity,"Of course you can, darling."
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,rainbow dash,Call me Professor Egghead. I'm in!
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,pinkie pie,[screams] First day at school! So many new ponies!
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,twilight sparkle,About that. One thing I forgot to mention. It's not just ponies.
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,pinkie pie,That was unexpected.
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,rarity,Ooh! Students certainly traveled from far and wide to attend our school!
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,twilight sparkle,"Princess Celestia helped me reach out to all the kingdoms. After all, friendship is something that needs to be shared with every... creature."
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,twilight sparkle,Welcome to the School of Friendship! I'm your headmare Twilight Sparkle. Please follow Guidance Counselor Starlight to sign in and get your class assignments. Then we can show you your living quarters.
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,sandbar,"Whoa, sorry! I'm Sandbar. Are you a student here, too?"
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,rainbow dash,Grandpa Gruff? What are you doing here?
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,gallus,"Rainbow Dash, right? Gilda told me about you. You're a teacher? Huh. Thought you'd be... cooler."
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,prince rutherford,Ponies!
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,pinkie pie,Prince Rutherford!
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,prince rutherford,This Yona Yak. She come to pony school. Hah. Make it better.
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,yona,Yak can't wait to meet ponies and tell all about Yakyakistan!
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,applejack,Why don't I show you around before you destroy the place?
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,smolder,But dragons are better than this! Why am I here?
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,ember,"Because as Dragon Lord, I'm ordering you to be here! Hey, Spike! Come meet Smolder."
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,spike,"Great to see you, Ember! Uh, which one is Smolder?"
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,thorax,Ocellus! What did we talk about?
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,thorax,"I told you, stay in your own form. It's the polite thing to do. Sorry, she's shy."
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,silverstream,What is that?! No way! I didn't know ponies could turn into... um... What are you?
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,thorax,A changeling.
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,silverstream,Ponies can turn into changelings?!
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,fluttershy,"No, but changelings can turn into ponies."
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,silverstream,Huh. That's confusing!
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,silverstream,"This place is amazing! I've spent most of my life in a coral reef underwater. I was a seapony, but now I'm a Hippogriff. Long story. Anyway, wow! Is that a yak?!"
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,twilight sparkle,Thank you so much for supporting the grand opening of our school. I hope you'll all join us for Friends and Family Day to see the amazing progress your students are making.
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,twilight sparkle,Looks like school's in session!
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,twilight sparkle,"Take a breath, look around, it's amazing I can't believe that it's real Students galore, new ideas to explore Can't contain the excitement I feel"
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,twilight sparkle,"Wait, hold on! Not like that! Just a second! I'm not sure if that method's approved Let me take a look <U+0096> yup, right here in the book"
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,rainbow dash,Come on! We just got in the groove!
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,twilight sparkle,"Can't mess up, can't afford a mistake now We are shaping young minds to ignite Do it like it says in the book Now make sure you're doing it right"
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,pinkie pie,There's not an equation on how to have fun
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,fluttershy,"The students look bored now <U+0096> oh, what have I done?"
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,applejack,"Can't teach bein' honest, not sure what to do"
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,rarity,I'm quite certain I'm lost
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,pinkie pie,No way to have fun
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,fluttershy,"Oh, what have I done?"
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,twilight sparkle,Make sure to do things by the book now
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,silverstream,Is this what boring is? Am I bored?
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,smolder,"Ugh, please. These ponies are the heroes of Equestria?"
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,sandbar,"Listen, these ponies saved all of us from the Storm King."
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,gallus,How? By boring him into surrender?
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,ocellus,Our teachers are a little different than I expected.
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,yona,Ugh! Pony school waste of time! Yak school teach how to braid yak hair! Braiding yak hair is best! Whoa!
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,smolder,Oof! Is there anything in Yakyakistan that isn't the best?
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,yona,Yes! Wait. No! Yaks best.
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,smolder,"No claws, no wings, no fire. What is it exactly you're proud of?"
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,sandbar,"Whoa, cool it. No need to harsh Yona's love for her heritage, okay?"
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,gallus,"Awww, are we not being sweet and friendly enough for you, pony?"
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,silverstream,"That was sarcasm, right? Because you weren't being sweet or nice!"
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,smolder,Maybe dragons and griffons are just too tough for friendship.
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,yona,"Yaks tough, just not nasty."
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,gallus,"Who you calling nasty, klutz?"
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,rainbow dash,"Okay, break it up! Break... it... up!"
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,starlight glimmer,What is going on here?!
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,gallus,Just a friendly discussion about the magic of friendship amongst friends.
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,applejack,"Everypony<U+0097> I mean, everyone, go to your next class! I just can't believe it. Fights breakin' out when they're supposed to be learnin' friendship?"
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,starlight glimmer,"Things definitely aren't going as ""by the book"" as Twilight planned."
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,rainbow dash,That's because we're terrible teachers! Face it. This school isn't gonna work.
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,applejack,[fading in] ...fights breakin' out in the hallway...
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,pinkie pie,...putting myself to sleep!
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,rainbow dash,"I don't look like that, do I?"
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,twilight sparkle,I get it. Things are getting off to a rougher start than expected. But that's okay!
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,spike,"Who are you, and what have you done with Twilight Sparkle?"
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,twilight sparkle,"Every school in Equestria follows these rules. As long as we do too, we'll be fine."
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,starlight glimmer,Maybe we should... try something new?
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,twilight sparkle,The EEA will be here this afternoon for Friends and Family Day. They need to see a school that follows their guidelines.
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,fluttershy,Even if those guidelines aren't working?
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,twilight sparkle,"Well, then we have to try harder and make sure they do."
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,twilight sparkle,"Another morning, another chance to inspire our students!"
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,sandbar,Hey! Professor Dash's class is this way.
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,ocellus,"Where are you going? You're not [gasps] skipping, are you?"
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,smolder,That's exactly what we're doing.
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,silverstream,But Friends and Family Day<U+0097>
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,gallus,Is after class. Relax. This is just a quick... mental health break.
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,silverstream,That sounds legit! We're in!
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,sandbar,"I guess I'll tag along, too. Make sure you don't get into... trouble."
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,fluttershy,"This way, Angel!"
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,silverstream,Professor Fluttershy! We're busted!
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,fluttershy,"Oh, my! What are you all doing? Aren't classes that way?"
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,ocellus,"Ah<U+0097> [clears throat] A generosity field trip, daaaaarling. [giggles] I'm taking the students to the lake to look at our divine reflections."
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,fluttershy,"Oh, that sounds nice. Have fun!"
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,smolder,I take back everything I said about you! That was cool!
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,ocellus,"Thanks! Wait, what did you say about me?"
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,starlight glimmer,You're sure sticking to the book is gonna work?
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,twilight sparkle,My friends can handle anything. They'll have these problems turned around before we know it.
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,neighsay,Problems?
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,twilight sparkle,Chancellor Neighsay! You're here!
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,neighsay,Yes. And you seem unprepared. If there are problems...
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,twilight sparkle,Problems? Ha! Of course not! We can't wait to show you around!
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,gallus,And that's why griffons breathe fire when we get mad.
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,silverstream,They do not! Wait! Do they? No! Really?!
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,yona,Griffons just full of hot air!
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,smolder,And yaks are actually good at jokes. How about that?
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,ocellus,What are dragons good at?
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,smolder,Competition! Who's up for a race?
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,twilight sparkle,Rainbow Dash! Why aren't you in class teaching?
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,rainbow dash,"Because my students are gone! Uh, g-gone somewhere else! Doing a loyalty lesson! And-and I was just going to grab, uh... this pencil! Because they need it. Wherever they are. Which I know, 'cause... I'm the teacher!"
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,twilight sparkle,"I see. [laughs nervously] Well, Chancellor, we have other classes. We can just<U+0097>"
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,neighsay,Let's follow the professor. I'm quite curious about this lesson in loyalty.
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,twilight sparkle,"[voiceover] Of course, we want to instill a sense of loyalty towards others. We encourage acts of generosity and kindness."
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,gallus,Figured we shouldn't be the only ones enjoying the view.
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,yona,Waaaah! Yak not best at flying!
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,twilight sparkle,[voiceover] And appreciation for the value of laughter...
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,yona,Flying is best!
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,silverstream,"Congratulations, Yona! You are officially the weirdest thing I've seen so far!"
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,smolder,"What do you say, Ocellus? Can you be weirder than a flying yak?"
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,twilight sparkle,...and to always be honest in any situation.
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,neighsay,"Honesty is imperative. Princess, are we going in circles?"
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,twilight sparkle,"Uh, look at the time! We'd better head to the lake for Friends and Family Day. I'm sure all the students and faculty will be there."
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,ember,What is that?!
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,neighsay,Aah! The school is under attack!
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,silverstream,"Uh, maybe skipping class wasn't the best idea?"
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,neighsay,How dare you! This act of aggression against ponies<U+0097>!
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,twilight sparkle,"I-I'm so sorry, Chancellor. We clearly had some students get a little carried away."
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,neighsay,Those are students? But you said you were opening this school to protect Equestria! To defend ponies from... dangerous creatures who don't have our best interests at heart!
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,twilight sparkle,My school teaches for all of us to work together through friendship.
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,neighsay,And how do you know these creatures won't take what they have learned here and use it against us?
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,twilight sparkle,Friendship isn't just for ponies!
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,neighsay,It should be.
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,prince rutherford,Unicorn think yaks no need friendship? Maybe yaks no need pony school!
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,neighsay,"Well, perhaps you should return to your kind."
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,ember,"""Your kind""?! Smolder, let's go!"
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,thorax,[despondently] It's fine. We know not every pony sees us the way you do. We're used to it.
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,twilight sparkle,Princess Celestia helped me reach out to all the kingdoms! When she hears you closed the school because<U+0097>!
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,neighsay,Because you failed to meet the EEA's standards?
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,twilight sparkle,What?!
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,neighsay,"Irresponsible teachers, students skipping class, endangering ponies! Your school is a disaster. Perhaps if you had had higher standards for who was admitted, this could have been avoided. Regardless..."
School Daze - Part 1,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,neighsay,"By order of the EEA, I am shutting this school... [stomps] down!"
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,twilight sparkle,This happened while we were gone?
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,applejack,Friendship quests beyond Equestria?
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,twilight sparkle,We're gonna open a school!
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,neighsay,We expect you to do things by... the... book!
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,twilight sparkle,"We have a huge responsibility, and I need you all to do this by the book."
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,smolder,These ponies are the heroes of Equestria?
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,gallus,This is just a quick... mental health break.
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,neighsay,The school is under attack!
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,neighsay,Those are students?
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,neighsay,I am shutting this school... [stomps] down!
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,spike,Twilight? You feeling okay?
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,spike,"[sighs] Look on the bright side. Sure, the EEA closed your friendship school. But now you've got time to do other stuff! It's like being on vacation!"
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,spike,Whoa!
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,spike,"Okay, then. I'm gonna need backup. Operation Cheer-Up is a go!"
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,rainbow dash,"Come on, Twilight! You can't sit around in the boring dark all day!"
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,applejack,Exactly! What you need is a double dose of Granny Smith's apple mash.
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,fluttershy,"Whenever I'm sad, a hug from Angel Bunny always makes me feel better."
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,rarity,I find that nothing brightens my mood like a new ensemble!
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,pinkie pie,"[whispering, to Spike] You didn't tell me this was a pity party! I would've brought ice cream!"
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,twilight sparkle,"I appreciate you trying to make me feel better, but not everything can be fixed with dresses and cupcakes."
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,pinkie pie,What?!
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,twilight sparkle,I just need some time to be alone and think.
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,twilight sparkle,Oh...
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,starlight glimmer,I wondered how long you'd take to get tired of pillow-fort pouting.
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,twilight sparkle,Everypony's already tried to cheer me up. It won't work.
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,starlight glimmer,[short laugh] I'm not gonna cheer you up. I'm gonna tell you what you did wrong.
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,twilight sparkle,What?!
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,starlight glimmer,You gave up too easily.
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,starlight glimmer,"Hey, you made me a guidance counselor. That means tough love."
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,twilight sparkle,Neighsay was right. I failed. The school was a disaster.
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,starlight glimmer,"So was I when you met me. But you showed me that when you know in your heart something is right, you stand up for it. You did that for me. Why not for this?"
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,twilight sparkle,I can't go against the EEA! They're in charge of all the schools in Equestria!
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,starlight glimmer,And you're in charge of all the friendship in Equestria. Why should you let somepony else stop you from doing your job?
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,twilight sparkle,But the EEA rulebook<U+0097>
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,starlight glimmer,Doesn't matter! You can write your own rules! Because you are doing something new. Something important!
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,twilight sparkle,You're right! Why we're doing this is way more important than how we're doing this! And we are doing this!
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,starlight glimmer,"Now, that's the Twilight I know. How can I help?"
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,twilight sparkle,You already have.
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,twilight sparkle,Guess what? The School of Friendship is back in business!
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,rainbow dash,What?!
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,rarity,But why?!
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,fluttershy,"Oh, no."
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,applejack,Bad idea.
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,pinkie pie,Do we still get to guess?
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,rainbow dash,"No offense, Twilight, but teaching at that school was the most boring, horrible, awful thing ever."
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,applejack,"Uh, pretty sure she's gonna take offense to that."
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,twilight sparkle,"No, Rainbow Dash is right. I owe you all an apology. I was so focused on doing things the EEA way, I didn't listen to any of you. I'm sorry. I promise, this time, we'll run the school the way friends should <U+0096> together."
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,rarity,So... we'd be allowed to teach however we want to?
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,fluttershy,No more scary pop quizzes?
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,pinkie pie,Confetti cannons for everycreature?
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,twilight sparkle,Whatever you need to teach the Elements of Harmony.
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,pinkie pie,Yippeeeee!
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,applejack,"Well, in that case, we're behind you one hundred percent, Twilight."
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,spike,[clears throat] Just two small problems. The school is still unaccredited...
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,spike,...and we don't have any students.
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,twilight sparkle,I'll take care of the first part if you five can round up our class.
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,rainbow dash,Totally! Uh... how?
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,applejack,"Roundin' up the pony students ain't gonna be an issue, but..."
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,fluttershy,The creatures from the other kingdoms seemed pretty upset with us.
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,rarity,Pfft! Nonsense! I'm certain we can win them over with our charm and style!
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,pinkie pie,[singsongy] Cupcake-gram for Prince Rutherfoooord!
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,prince rutherford,Why pink pony here? Yaks mad at ponies!
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,pinkie pie,Because... you don't have to be mad anymore! We're reopening Twilight Sparkle's School of Friendship! And it's gonna be super-uper-duper better than before! We're<U+0097>
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,rarity,"<U+0097>ever so sorry about the misunderstanding. All creatures are, of course, welcome."
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,fluttershy,We would be really happy if you sent your student back to class.
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,applejack,It won't be the same without 'em. We're open and ready to start teachin'<U+0097>
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,rainbow dash,"<U+0097>right now! So, what are you waiting for? Get your student and let's go!"
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,prince rutherford,Where Yona?! This all pony's fault!
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,ember,"You're pretty quick to blame them! What are you hiding, yak?!"
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,thorax,C-Can... Can we just focus on finding our lost students?
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,princess celestia,"Please, everycreature! If you can just explain what happened..."
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,twilight sparkle,I can't believe it! They did learn friendship!
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,twilight sparkle,Sorry.
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,ember,"Yeah? Well, my dragons will burn every kingdom until we find which of you is hiding Smolder!"
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,prince rutherford,Yaks fight griffons and dragons!
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,thorax,The Changeling Empire can't afford an international incident. If any creature blames the changelings for this<U+0097>
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,ember,"What are you up to, shapeshifter?!"
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,thorax,B-But we're friends!
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,princess celestia,"Find the students quickly, Twilight, or I fear our world will be at war!"
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,twilight sparkle,Okay. Let's review what we know.
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,spike,"Smolder, Ocellus, Silverstream, Yona, and Gallus disappeared together."
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,spike,That's all we know.
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,applejack,They're probably just off hidin' somewhere.
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,starlight glimmer,Unless they used some kind of spell to disappear.
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,rainbow dash,Ooh! Or went undercover!
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,pinkie pie,Maybe they were attacked by a ferocious shrimp! Nopony ever expects that!
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,fluttershy,[gasps] Shrimps can attack?
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,pinkie pie,Nope! That's why nopony expects it.
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,sandbar,Whoa!
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,pinkie pie,"Hi, Sandbar! Are you having a party?"
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,sandbar,"[incredibly nervously] No! I'm just, um... really hungry? Yeah?"
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,rarity,"We need to think like our students. If someone told us we would never see each other again, what would we do?"
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,pinkie pie,Go someplace we could all hang out and eat lots and lots of cupcakes!
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,pinkie pie,What?
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,fluttershy,Sandbar was friends with all of the missing students... and he just got plenty of cupcakes.
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,applejack,Huh. He was at the farm this mornin' pickin' up a wagonload of apples...
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,rarity,And I saw him in a shop buying pillows and blankets!
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,rainbow dash,[gasps] He must be taking all that stuff to the other students! We've gotta follow him!
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,gallus,[laughing] Huh. This place is way cooler than I thought it'd be.
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,smolder,"[chewing] Even I'm impressed. What's it called again, Ocellus?"
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,ocellus,"The Castle of the Two Sisters. I remembered it from class. Princess Twilight's ""History of Pre-Equestrian Friendships""."
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,gallus,Huh. Who knew? School was actually good for something.
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,yona,Yona not really like school. But Yona like new friends!
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,smolder,[grunts] [strained] Smolder... like breathing!
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,silverstream,"Hey, you guys! Sandbar's back!"
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,yona,Cupcakes are best cakes!
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,sandbar,Aah!
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,sandbar,"[sighs] Thanks for the assist, Gallus."
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,ocellus,Pillows! How nice! The castle is gonna be so much more comfy.
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,smolder,And fun! Pillow fight!
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,silverstream,You guys! I just found stairs!
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,gallus,Aaaand we care because...?
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,silverstream,"Stairs are awesome! We don't have anything like 'em underwater, 'cause you know, [magic zap] no way to climb 'em!"
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,silverstream,This place has everything! If only my family back home could see it...
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,ocellus,I wish the other changelings could meet you all. You're not nearly as strange as the stories say.
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,smolder,"Gee, thanks. But yeah, hanging out with other creatures is actually... not bad."
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,sandbar,"Uh, most other creatures. What is that thing?"
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,ocellus,"[sighs] Am I the only one who didn't sleep through Professor Fluttershy's ""Critters of Comfort and Conflict"" class? It's a puckwudgie. Maybe I can make friends with it!"
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,ocellus,Oops.
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,smolder,"Think, Ocellus! Did Professor Fluttershy say anything about how to beat puckwudgies in her lecture?!"
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,ocellus,"Uh... I'm sorry, I can't remember!"
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,gallus,"I'm gonna go ahead and guess it's not pillows, apples<U+0097>"
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,gallus,...or cupcakes.
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,silverstream,Wouldn't class have been about how to make friends with them?
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,sandbar,"Uh, guys? They're getting really close..."
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,yona,Yona not scared! Yona have friends!
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,gallus,Is that Professor Egghead?!
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,spike,"Aw, yeah!"
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,fluttershy,Oh! Don't hurt them! Just ask them to leave nicely.
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,yona,Not bad! [quickly] For pony.
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,ocellus,Wow! They're amazing!
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,gallus,I had no idea our teachers were actually cool.
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,sandbar,[chuckles] I've been trying to tell you!
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,silverstream,"Did you see that?! Rainbow Dash was like voooooom and then werrrrr, and the puckwudgies went flying! And then the birds came and<U+0097>!"
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,smolder,"Yeah, we all just lived it. But you're right. That was pretty amazing. Even by dragon standards."
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,twilight sparkle,Is everycreature alright?
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,spike,[panting] You're lucky we got here in time!
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,starlight glimmer,"You know, this probably isn't the safest place for a campout."
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,ocellus,Does that mean you're going to send us back to our homes?
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,twilight sparkle,Not exactly. We have another option in mind.
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,gallus,We're listening.
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,twilight sparkle,It's pretty clear you've already started learning friendship without your teachers. But we'd like to show you even more... if you'd come back to school?
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,smolder,Not much of a choice.
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,applejack,"To be honest, we felt exactly the same way when Twilight told us she was reopening the school."
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,rarity,"But this time, we guarantee it shall be different."
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,rainbow dash,"Oh, yeah! With class run my way, it'll be two hundred and twenty percent cooler."
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,fluttershy,And without the EEA<U+0097>
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,fluttershy,<U+0097>it'll be much friendlier.
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,pinkie pie,"Plus, all your nations won't go to war if you come back with us! Bonus!"
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,sandbar,Wait. What's happening?
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,princess celestia,Twilight! I was so relieved to get your letter!
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,gallus,I'm not leaving.
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,ocellus,"None of us are. Sorry, Thorax."
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,prince rutherford,Yak not understand. This pony joke?
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,smolder,No. We're going back to school.
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,ember,How? You can't even get inside!
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,twilight sparkle,School is back in session!
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,neighsay,Who dared remove my seal?
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,twilight sparkle,"I did, Chancellor Neighsay! And I respectfully ask you to step aside, or classes will start late."
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,neighsay,"Classes won't start at all! The EEA has spoken, and none shall pass!"
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,yona,Yak pass if yak say! Hmph!
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,neighsay,"This is for the greater good. The school was disorganized, the teachers unqualified! And those dangerous and unpredictable ""students"" put ponies' lives in danger!"
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,ember,[growls] I'll show you unpredictable!
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,princess celestia,"Hold on, please! I'm sure Princess Twilight Sparkle has a good explanation for all of this."
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,twilight sparkle,I do! It's true that my School of Friendship is EEA-unaccredited...
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,spike,Look! She said it without doing the eye thing!
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,neighsay,Then it is not a school!
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,twilight sparkle,It's not an EEA school. It's a friendship school with its own rules. I should know. I wrote the book!
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,twilight sparkle,"These students reminded me that every friendship is special, so the way we teach it has to be just as unique. My school is going to do things differently."
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,neighsay,"Allowing all of these creatures to attend your school, changing the rules for them <U+0096> it simply won't work!"
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,princess celestia,"I seem to recall something about Earth ponies, unicorns, and Pegasi doing something similar, don't you?"
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,twilight sparkle,"I promise you, Chancellor. My school will help protect Equestria."
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,neighsay,Or destroy it!
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,twilight sparkle,This brand new school of friendship Is home to everyone
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,ocellus,We're learning how to trust
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,gallus,We're here to all have fun
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,rarity,With friendship ties that bind us
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,applejack,Tighter than the strongest bonds
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,fluttershy,We're hoof-in-hoof
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,twilight sparkle,There's a griffon in the garden
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,rainbow dash,Hippogriffs hang in the hall
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,spike,And the door will be open To all creatures great and small
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,pinkie pie,And a yak or two or three
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,starlight glimmer,That might have been a changeling
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,fluttershy,But it kind of looks like me
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,twilight sparkle,Some things you just can't teach with books Some things you only know So trust your heart and let us lead And your friendship's sure to grow
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,ember,"Ugh, fine! If you promise to stop singing, Smolder can stay!"
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,smolder,Wahoo!
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,prince rutherford,"Uh, if dragon stay, yak stay."
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,thorax,"I know you will make the changelings proud, Ocellus."
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,starlight glimmer,"Guess I make a pretty good guidance counselor, huh?"
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,twilight sparkle,Yes! Writing the rulebook was the most fun ever! I can't wait to start working on the new lesson plans!
School Daze - Part 2,Michael Vogel & Nicole Dubuc,twilight sparkle,...with some help from my friends.
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,maud pie,[taps on microphone] [deadpan] What do you call an Alicorn with no wings and no horn?
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,maud pie,Earth pony.
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,maud pie,"[deadpan] But seriously, being an Earth pony isn't so bad. We've got magic powers, too. Like walking around and picking stuff up with our teeth."
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,maud pie,"[deadpan] That's sarcasm, by the way."
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,"[laughs] It's funny, 'cause it's true!"
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,maud pie,"[deadpan] My favorite thing to listen to is clastic rock <U+0096> the accumulation of sediments over millennia forming to create sandstone, shale, and breccia. It sounds something like this."
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,maud pie,[deadpan] And that's my time.
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,"[laughs] Isn't my sister Maud the most hilarious, entertaining, amazing comedian ever?"
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,"Your jokes, your hilarious delivery, your... your everything!"
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,maud pie,[deadpan] How was my... timing?
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,"[laughing] You got me! C'mon, let's celebrate sister-style. We can get matching stickers that says ""Eyes on the Pies"", then show them off at the Ponyville Sticker Convention that I could plan for tomorrow if you want."
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,maud pie,"[deadpan] Actually, I'm busy tonight."
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,"Aww, that's what you said yesterday. And the day before that. And the day before the day before that. [sighs] It's just, we haven't hung out in a really long time because you always have other plans. Even when you promised to build whipped-cream pyramids with me."
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,maud pie,"[deadpan] I know. I am sorry, Pinkie. The reason is I have a<U+0097>"
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,"Apology accepted, as long as we get some serious sister time before your birthday. And there's, uh, definitely no reason I wanna hang out before your birthday. Just, you know, not planning anything special."
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,maud pie,[deadpan] Okay.
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,What about tomorrow morning?
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,maud pie,[deadpan] Okay.
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,Yay! Just you and me. Best sister friends forever!
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,maud pie,[deadpan] Best sister friends forever.
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,"[continues squealing] Tomorrow is today! Who's ready for some fun times at Sugarcube Corner? The answer is ""you""! I would also accept ""Maud"". Maud? Maud!"
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,"[gasps] Oh, I get it! We're playing hide-and-go-seek!"
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,Aha! Found you!
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,"Where's Maud? I've already tried Discord's dimension, Granny Smith's wax museum, and Yakyakistan! She has to be here!"
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,starlight glimmer,"Nope, it's just me. Reading."
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,Story checks out. Or does it?! It does. But are you sure there's nopony hiding... in your closet?!
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,starlight glimmer,"Pinkie, I don't have a closet. Is everything okay?"
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,No. I was supposed to go birthday cake shopping with Maud today.
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,starlight glimmer,And ruin her surprise party?
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,"I wasn't gonna tell her why, silly. But now I can't even find Maud. I'm usually way better at hide-and-seek than this."
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,starlight glimmer,"Oh, she probably just found a new rock formation and forgot you two were gonna hang out. Tell ya what. You take care of the cake, and I'll look for Maud."
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,"Really? Thanks, Starlight!"
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,Just checking.
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,[whispering] I've gotta get very important ingredients for a very important pony's cake. And it's gotta be tippy-top super-duper secret.
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,mudbriar,"Technically, it's not your turn yet."
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,Oh. I'm sorry. Didn't mean to cut in front of anypony.
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,"Um, whatcha doin'?"
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,mudbriar,I am currently speaking to a pony at a baking supply shop two minutes before it closes for lunch.
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,"Rrrrrright. Okay. Just that I'm trying to plan a party here, and the clock is ticking, while you, uh... What are you doing anyway?"
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,mudbriar,I am currently speaking to a<U+0097>
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,"I mean, can I help you move this along? What are you looking for? Rolling pins, cupcake tins, cookie cutters with tails and fins?"
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,mudbriar,[to S06E12 Unnamed Unicorn Mare #3] Goodbye.
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,That's what you've been standing here all this time to say?
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,mudbriar,"I was deciding between ""goodbye"" and ""see you later""."
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,"Uh... but, they're the same thing."
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,mudbriar,"Technically, they're very different. ""See you later"" implies an event in the near future wherein we see each other. ""Goodbye"" expresses good wishes where parting or at the end of a conversation."
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,"Yyyyyeah, same thing."
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,mudbriar,I will not apologize for speaking with precision.
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,"In that case, apology not accepted. Goodbye, later, see ya<U+0097>same thing!"
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,"Ugh! Can you believe that guy?! Huh? ""Out to Lunch""?! Oh, come on!"
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,"[groans] No Maud, no cake, no anything! And how annoying was that pony? Who takes so long to say goodbye? Or was it ""see ya later""? Ugh! Now he's got me doing it!"
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,maud pie,"[deadpan] Hello, Pinkie Pie."
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,Maud! Found you! My turn to hide! Hee-hee!
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,maud pie,[deadpan] I'm sorry I wasn't around this morning.
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,"Oh, pssh. What are you apologizing to me for? I'm not upset, you silly-willy."
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,maud pie,[deadpan] The reason is I met somepony<U+0097>
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,"Wanna hang out right now? I mean, I can see you're not doing anything with anypony else. Unless they're invisible or reeeeeaaaally small."
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,maud pie,"[deadpan] Pinkie, the reason I've been so busy is that I have a boyfriend now."
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,A wha...?
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,maud pie,[deadpan] A boyfriend.
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,A whaaa...?!
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,maud pie,[deadpan] A boyfriend.
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,A whaaaaa...?!
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,maud pie,[deadpan] A boyfriend.
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,"That's so exciting! My sister, in love!"
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,maud pie,"[deadpan] Technically, we're in ""like""."
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,"Tell me everything! Who is he? What's his favorite color? Does he like ice cream? If he were a bird, what kind of bird would he be? Wait. Is he actually a bird? Oh! I don't know, because you haven't told me anything yet!"
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,maud pie,[deadpan] You'll like him. We have a lot in common.
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,"Well, I love you, so I know I'm gonna love your boyfriend! Oh, I can't wait to meet him!"
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,maud pie,[deadpan] You don't have to.
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,"[gasps] He's a rock! And you love rocks, so it's perfect! [gasps] Is Boulder jealous?"
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,maud pie,"[deadpan] No. Behind the rock. Mudbriar, are you back there?"
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,mudbriar,"Technically, not anymore."
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,[gasps] A wha-whaaaaaaaaa?!
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,maud pie,"[deadpan] Pinkie Pie, meet Mudbriar."
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,mudbriar,"Technically, we've already met."
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,You?!
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,mudbriar,M'yes.
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,You?
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,mudbriar,M'yes.
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,You...
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,mudbriar,M'yes.
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,"I mean, [laughs] you! You, you, you!"
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,mudbriar,M'yes. M'yes. M'yes.
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,"I'm sorry. Let's start over. Hi, I'm Maud's sister, Pinkie Pie."
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,mudbriar,I know.
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,Sooooo... how did... you two meet?
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,maud pie,[deadpan] At a rock show.
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,"Oh! You're into rocks, too?"
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,mudbriar,No. I like sticks.
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,Then why were you at a rock show?
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,mudbriar,"It was a petrified wood show, which technically makes it a stick show."
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,maud pie,"[deadpanly happy] Except that in the per-mineralization process of petrification, all organic material is replaced with silicates <U+0096> i.e., rocks."
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,mudbriar,"While retaining the original structural elements of wood <U+0096> q.e.d., it was a stick show."
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,"I'm... really into sticks, too! They're great for hitting pi<f1>atas! Haaaaa..."
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,maud pie,[deadpan] Pinkie...
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,Oh! You wanna go first?
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,mudbriar,That is stick abuse.
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,"It is? I'm sorry. Oh, this is awful. I'm not being a very good sister. Let's start over. I'm Pinkie Pie! Nice to meet you!"
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,mudbriar,"Technically, we've already met."
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,maud pie,[deadpan] You should introduce Pinkie to your pet.
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,Oh! Your pet likes fetch!
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,mudbriar,This is my pet. So no.
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,maud pie,[deadpanly happy] Aw. Look at Twiggy and Boulder playing together.
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,mudbriar,They're adorable.
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,"[whispering, to Maud] It's just a stick."
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,maud pie,[deadpan] Don't be rude.
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,"[sighs] I'm sorry, I'm sorry. One more time. [through gritted teeth] I'm Pinkie Pie! Nice to meet you!"
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,mudbriar,"Technically, we've already met."
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,[straining] Daaah! I don't get this guy!
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,starlight glimmer,Wow. Maud has a boyfriend?
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,[groans] How could she like someone so weird? He has an inanimate object for a pet!
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,starlight glimmer,So does Maud.
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,"Boulder has ten times the personality of some random stick! Mudbriar, too, for that matter. He's not like Maud at all! Maud is hilarious, friendly, caring, and easy to talk to!"
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,starlight glimmer,"Yep, that's Maud."
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,"But this guy is awkward, quiet, and kind of... strange."
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,starlight glimmer,"Uh, that also sounds like Maud."
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,"[laughs] You're so funny, Starlight! Maud is nothing like Mudbriar. If she were, then we wouldn't be best sister friends forever."
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,starlight glimmer,"Well, Maud obviously likes something about him."
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,starlight glimmer,Maybe you just need to spend more time with him. Find out what you have in common.
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,That's easy <U+0096> nothing!
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,starlight glimmer,You both care about Maud. I know. He could help you with her party.
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,I guess...
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,starlight glimmer,And I'll keep Maud busy while you and Mudbriar plan the best surprise birthday ever.
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,That I can do!
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,"Listen. Maud's birthday is tomorrow, and there's no time to waste. You're not afraid of slides, are you?"
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,mudbriar,No. Whyyyyyyyyyyy??!
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,mudbriar,Oof!
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,No reason. Wheeeeeee!
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,Welcome to my party planning cave!
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,mudbriar,"Technically, due to the speleothems growing from the ceiling, this is more of a cavern than a cave. Maud taught me that."
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,"Yeah, okay."
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,"Here's what I'm thinking for her surprise party <U+0096> edible rock candy plates, gem-shaped ice cubes, a pebble pi<f1>ata. Uh... we'll skip that one."
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,mudbriar,Might I make some suggestions?
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,Oh. Suggest away! That's why you're here! You and me! Planning... together! Friends!
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,mudbriar,"I have a vision board of everything Maud loves, and none of those things are on it."
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,"Hmph. Let me see this ""vision board""."
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,mudbriar,"It's not a physical thing. I'm envisioning it. [quietly] Om, I enter through the large door of my mind palace and enter to the back, where I have all of my books and possessions, and what do I encounter? The Maud Room. None of those things are there. [out loud] Just as I thought. Maud doesn't like surprises."
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,Where does it say that? She never told me that!
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,mudbriar,Mmm. It sounds like she was protecting your feelings. She's very caring that way.
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,Stop acting like you know my sister better than me!
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,mudbriar,"Technically, I never said that."
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,"[angrily] Well, technically, I don't care! And since I've been best sister friends forever with Maud my entire life, I think I'm the expert here! Oh, but fine. If you don't believe me, let's ask her! [whispering] But we have to be super-sneaky."
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,mudbriar,Can you be more specific?
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,No!
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,starlight glimmer,Huh. You must be Mudbriar.
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,starlight glimmer,I'm Starlight Glimmer. Nice to meet you. I've heard great things!
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,starlight glimmer,I'm so glad the two of you are spending time together. So... how's it going?
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,"Mudbriar and I have just spent the best time bonding! And we're really starting to make some headway becoming besties, except for one teensy-weensy disagreement that maybe you could settle, Maud. See, Mudbriar here seems to think that [starting to laugh] you don't like surprise parties! Isn't it funny how [suddenly angry] wrong he is?!"
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,maud pie,[deadpan] I like surprise parties...
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,Hmmmm.
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,maud pie,[deadpan] ...because I know they make you happy when you throw them for me.
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,"See? Wait, what?!"
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,maud pie,"[deadpan] I'd rather just do something small with you, Starlight, Boulder, and Mudbriar for my birthday."
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,No party? No party?! Did he put you up to this?!
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,maud pie,[deadpan] Mm-mm.
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,"[whispering] Maybe you should consider, I don't know, taking things a little less serious with Mudbriar because he's kinda sort of... [loudly] impossible to like?!"
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,starlight glimmer,"Hey, Mudbriar, have you ever flown a kite? Let me tell you all about it. See, the first thing you should do is<U+0097>"
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,I just can't believe you would choose sitting around with him over a party with your own sister!
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,maud pie,"[deadpan] I didn't choose either of you. Technically, I said I wanted to be with both of you."
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,"[gasps] ""Technically""?! Ugh, you even like the way he talks?"
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,maud pie,[deadpan] Everything about him makes me happy.
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,[gasps] [tearing up] Then I guess you don't need a best sister friend forever anymore.
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,maud pie,[deadpanly concerned] Pinkie...
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,starlight glimmer,"Uh, wait, let's all slow down and talk about this."
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,mudbriar,See you later!
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,[crying] I don't understand! How could Maud like Mudbriar? Is it Opposite Day? Nothing makes sense!
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,Ohhh.
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,You're probably wondering why I came back to the family farm in the middle of the night.
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,"Well, it all started when<U+0097>"
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,[sad groan] It's just... Maud has a boyfriend.
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,"It's just that I love Maud, and I want to love Mudbriar, but I can't see anything to like about him!"
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,You mean that lumpy grey one?
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,"I would not describe that as beautiful, blue, or white, but... [laughs nervously] Okay."
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,"So you're saying I should crack open Mudbriar like a rock! It all makes sense! No, wait. It doesn't."
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,"Oh, Limestone, Marble, thank you! I don't know what I'd do without you two! Pie pile!"
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,I really owe Mudbriar an apology. [gasps] And I owe Maud a party! I just hope I'm not too late!
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,"I brought you an olive branch to say sorry. I was really unfair to you, and I'm ready to listen to your ideas for Maud's birthday, if you still want to plan it together."
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,mudbriar,"Technically, this isn't even an olive branch. It's a quercus, most likely castaneifolia."
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,"Oh, come on! [through gritted teeth] Sorry! Keeping it together...!"
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,mudbriar,And I love a good quercus. Friends?
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,"Friends! Now, do you have any ideas for the party?"
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,mudbriar,There is one.
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,maud pie,[deadpanly happy] This is my favorite party ever.
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,It was all your amazing boyfriend's idea. He said the best present would be me throwing you a surprise party you didn't have to go to.
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,mudbriar,"Technically, it wasn't a surprise because she could see the pre-party preparations from up here."
The Maud Couple,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,[through gritted teeth] Technically... [normally] You're right!
Fake It 'Til You Make It,Josh Hamilton,fluttershy,"Don't worry, Angel, I won't forget you."
Fake It 'Til You Make It,Josh Hamilton,fluttershy,[sighs] There's nothing so peaceful as a cuddly friends picnic.
Fake It 'Til You Make It,Josh Hamilton,rarity,Fluttershy!
Fake It 'Til You Make It,Josh Hamilton,fluttershy,"Oh, goodness, Rarity! What's the matter?"
Fake It 'Til You Make It,Josh Hamilton,rarity,"Oh, the better question would be, ""What isn't the matter?"""
Fake It 'Til You Make It,Josh Hamilton,fluttershy,"Oh, dear. Do you wanna have some lettuce and talk about it?"
Fake It 'Til You Make It,Josh Hamilton,rarity,"Uh... Oh! I would love to, darling, but I just don't have the time. The Canterlot Royal Fashion Show is practically upon us, and the cornerstone piece of my collection just isn't working!"
Fake It 'Til You Make It,Josh Hamilton,fluttershy,"Oh, that sounds serious."
Fake It 'Til You Make It,Josh Hamilton,rarity,"Oh-ho-ho, it's serious. The entire collection is designed around it!"
Fake It 'Til You Make It,Josh Hamilton,fluttershy,Do you need help knitting? I've started making tea cozies. It's an elephant.
Fake It 'Til You Make It,Josh Hamilton,rarity,"Yes, well, I don't need help making clothes. Sassy Saddles is pitching in. Plus, I'll be pulling all three of my Manehattan assistants."
Fake It 'Til You Make It,Josh Hamilton,fluttershy,All three? Does that mean you'll have to close Rarity For You?
Fake It 'Til You Make It,Josh Hamilton,rarity,"That's just it, darling. This is Manehattan's busiest shopping season, and I can't just close the shop. So I was hoping... you might consider running it?"
Fake It 'Til You Make It,Josh Hamilton,fluttershy,Of course. I'm happy to help. Though I'm surprised you picked me.
Fake It 'Til You Make It,Josh Hamilton,rarity,"Well, I may have asked a few others."
Fake It 'Til You Make It,Josh Hamilton,rainbow dash,"Sorry, but we've got a Wonderbolts show coming up."
Fake It 'Til You Make It,Josh Hamilton,pinkie pie,"Sorry, but it's pie season and the pie orders are piling up."
Fake It 'Til You Make It,Josh Hamilton,twilight sparkle,"Sorry, I've got a curriculum to make up."
Fake It 'Til You Make It,Josh Hamilton,applejack,Nope.
Fake It 'Til You Make It,Josh Hamilton,big mcintosh,Nnnope.
Fake It 'Til You Make It,Josh Hamilton,maud pie,"[deadpan] My calendar's packed, but I hear Fluttershy's free. And you haven't asked Boulder."
Fake It 'Til You Make It,Josh Hamilton,rarity,Uh... Oh?
Fake It 'Til You Make It,Josh Hamilton,rarity,"[chuckles] It doesn't matter who else I asked, because I couldn't be happier that you agreed to help!"
Fake It 'Til You Make It,Josh Hamilton,fluttershy,I think I forgot how big this shop was. How do you find anything?
Fake It 'Til You Make It,Josh Hamilton,rarity,"Oh, darling, it's easy to track. The store is divided into sections <U+0096> chic, classic, modern, sophisticated, avant-garde, traditional, and obtuse. And, of course, each section is divided by season, color, and price. It's a classic SCP system. Then it's just a little ringing ponies up..."
Fake It 'Til You Make It,Josh Hamilton,rarity,"...a little fluff and fold... Voil<e0>! But, of course, that's the easy part."
Fake It 'Til You Make It,Josh Hamilton,fluttershy,[gasps] It is?
Fake It 'Til You Make It,Josh Hamilton,rarity,"Mm-hmm. As you well know, the real focus at Rarity For You is on the customer!"
Fake It 'Til You Make It,Josh Hamilton,rarity,Care to give it a try?
Fake It 'Til You Make It,Josh Hamilton,fluttershy,"Um, okay. [quietly] Hello. Um, welcome to Rarity For You. What can I help you with?"
Fake It 'Til You Make It,Josh Hamilton,fluttershy,"Um, aren't all those things opposites?"
Fake It 'Til You Make It,Josh Hamilton,fluttershy,But how can I<U+0097>?
Fake It 'Til You Make It,Josh Hamilton,fluttershy,"No! But I just, um<U+0097>"
Fake It 'Til You Make It,Josh Hamilton,rarity,"If I may, I'm thinking noir-esque minimalist but with a twist. Perhaps a tapered hem."
Fake It 'Til You Make It,Josh Hamilton,rarity,"Hmm. The inseams say, ""Yes!"""
Fake It 'Til You Make It,Josh Hamilton,fluttershy,Wow. You make it look so easy.
Fake It 'Til You Make It,Josh Hamilton,rarity,"Oh, darling, come now. You've conquered your shyness a thousand times over. You can't let a few fashion ponies undo all that progress."
Fake It 'Til You Make It,Josh Hamilton,fluttershy,I guess not.
Fake It 'Til You Make It,Josh Hamilton,rarity,You simply must access your inner strength and allow it to shine through!
Fake It 'Til You Make It,Josh Hamilton,fluttershy,How?
Fake It 'Til You Make It,Josh Hamilton,rarity,"Uh, daily affirmations? Meditation? Ooh! Power posing works wonders whenever I feel intimidated. Try these. Confident warrior! Gold medalist! Showpony!"
Fake It 'Til You Make It,Josh Hamilton,rarity,[clears throat] Or... not.
Fake It 'Til You Make It,Josh Hamilton,rarity,"Oh, goodness, look at the time! Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, go, go! I'm right behind you!"
Fake It 'Til You Make It,Josh Hamilton,fluttershy,You're not gonna be here? In your work room?
Fake It 'Til You Make It,Josh Hamilton,rarity,"But, darling, I simply can't. The fashion show is in Canterlot tomorrow, and I'll be up all night, even with the help of all of my assistants!"
Fake It 'Til You Make It,Josh Hamilton,rarity,"Well, not all my assistants."
Fake It 'Til You Make It,Josh Hamilton,fluttershy,Smoky! Softpad! Smoky Jr.!
Fake It 'Til You Make It,Josh Hamilton,rarity,"Ever since you convinced me to let them live in the shop, these beastie sweeties have been nothing but helpful."
Fake It 'Til You Make It,Josh Hamilton,fluttershy,And I'm sure they'll help me let my inner strength shine through!
Fake It 'Til You Make It,Josh Hamilton,rarity,"Oh, I wish I could stay and offer more help. [gasps] Why not try a new outfit? Think of it as the costume for your role as... Shop Pony! Ha ha! You know what they say <U+0096> ""clothes make the pony""."
Fake It 'Til You Make It,Josh Hamilton,fluttershy,"Um, who says that?"
Fake It 'Til You Make It,Josh Hamilton,rarity,"You know, ""them"". All right. I'm sure you and your furry friends will do just fine. Ta-ta!"
Fake It 'Til You Make It,Josh Hamilton,fluttershy,[sighs] I hope she's right.
Fake It 'Til You Make It,Josh Hamilton,fluttershy,Whew. Here goes nothing.
Fake It 'Til You Make It,Josh Hamilton,fluttershy,Welcome to Rarity For You. What can I help you with?
Fake It 'Til You Make It,Josh Hamilton,fluttershy,"Um, thread... count? Um... Well, I'm not sure. Let's see... Um, one, two, three, four..."
Fake It 'Til You Make It,Josh Hamilton,fluttershy,"Oh, I'm afraid I don't know much about fashion to satisfy these customers. What am I gonna do?"
Fake It 'Til You Make It,Josh Hamilton,fluttershy,"Oh, I've never tried to act before, but... I suppose it's worth a shot."
Fake It 'Til You Make It,Josh Hamilton,fluttershy,"[clears throat, snooty voice] Severe but not unapproachable. Acceptable business attire. [normal voice] Oh, does that sound like a shop pony to you?"
Fake It 'Til You Make It,Josh Hamilton,fluttershy,[snooty voice] So sorry for the wait. The shop has some... staffing issues today.
Fake It 'Til You Make It,Josh Hamilton,fluttershy,"Here at Rarity For You, our merchandise defies typical attempts to quantify its quality, but rest assured, it will make you the envy of all who see it."
Fake It 'Til You Make It,Josh Hamilton,fluttershy,Ta-ta!
Fake It 'Til You Make It,Josh Hamilton,fluttershy,"[normal voice, sighs, faints, pants, sighs] Smoky Jr., I can't believe it worked! [snooty voice] I suppose clothes really do make the pony after all."
Fake It 'Til You Make It,Josh Hamilton,rarity,"Oh, darling, I'm afraid I can't stop. Potential emergency at the boutique."
Fake It 'Til You Make It,Josh Hamilton,rarity,"Oh, well, I always knew Fluttershy had it in her. [laughs] And there's still time to catch the train to Canterlot!"
Fake It 'Til You Make It,Josh Hamilton,fluttershy,[snooty voice] It's an unique play on the old standard. We call it a Rarity cut with a triple-cut stitched hem and a guacamole chevka pattern fabric.
Fake It 'Til You Make It,Josh Hamilton,fluttershy,"If I had meant ""chevron"", then that's what I would've said."
Fake It 'Til You Make It,Josh Hamilton,fluttershy,"[normal voice] Aw, thanks, everyone. But I feel I should push the snootiness further."
Fake It 'Til You Make It,Josh Hamilton,fluttershy,"If you really wanna help, I suppose serving tea would be nice. Oh, if you don't mind."
Fake It 'Til You Make It,Josh Hamilton,fluttershy,[snooty voice] I'm afraid bold and shiny won't work with your whole... modelle. Perhaps... pointy.
Fake It 'Til You Make It,Josh Hamilton,fluttershy,"Not everypony can pull off a found object, but you... nearly get there."
Fake It 'Til You Make It,Josh Hamilton,fluttershy,Yes. Casual chic pr<ea>t-<e0>-porter is very branch<e9> this season.
Fake It 'Til You Make It,Josh Hamilton,fluttershy,"Um, one moment, please."
Fake It 'Til You Make It,Josh Hamilton,fluttershy,"[normal voice] Oh, I think I need a new character."
Fake It 'Til You Make It,Josh Hamilton,fluttershy,"[hipster voice] Okay, I've got, like, this high-key savage look for you? It's a totally live ensemble with a little, like, thingies that sparkle and make the whole squad go, ""Whoa! That pony is 'woke'!"""
Fake It 'Til You Make It,Josh Hamilton,fluttershy,"[hipster voice] Can you, like, chill for one sec? BRB."
Fake It 'Til You Make It,Josh Hamilton,fluttershy,"[goth voice] It's not like the futility of shopping can be made better with black leather and metal studs, but they help."
Fake It 'Til You Make It,Josh Hamilton,fluttershy,[snooty voice] This tea must always be at a precise temperature! See that it doesn't happen again!
Fake It 'Til You Make It,Josh Hamilton,fluttershy,"[hipster voice] Whoa, that color is, like, almost too lit for you? [goth voice] The blackness of this vest is a reflection of your soul. [snooty voice] This hemline is nothing short of an inspiration of craftsponyship. Are you sure you deserve it?"
Fake It 'Til You Make It,Josh Hamilton,fluttershy,[snooty voice] I don't know what's worse <U+0096> that you spilled the tea or that it's still cold! Either get it right or go back to the forest!
Fake It 'Til You Make It,Josh Hamilton,fluttershy,"Oh, it is so hard to find good help these days."
Fake It 'Til You Make It,Josh Hamilton,spike,"Okay! Okay! Slow down, everyone! I'm doing my best!"
Fake It 'Til You Make It,Josh Hamilton,spike,"So, Rarity is busy at an important fashion show, and Fluttershy is running her shop in Manehattan, but to do it, she's playing different shop pony characters that are all mean?"
Fake It 'Til You Make It,Josh Hamilton,twilight sparkle,"How in the world did you figure that out, Spike?"
Fake It 'Til You Make It,Josh Hamilton,spike,I'm not Dragon Charades champion for nothin'!
Fake It 'Til You Make It,Josh Hamilton,twilight sparkle,"I can't imagine Fluttershy would ever be mean to her animal friends. This sounds serious. Spike, tell everyone it's time to head back to Saddle Row!"
Fake It 'Til You Make It,Josh Hamilton,fluttershy,"[snooty voice] I wouldn't think it was possible to make something so dowdy even more matronly, but here you are. [goth voice] It's like a scream in the void, empty and ultimately meaningless. [hipster voice] I would srsly help you right now, but, like, I don't wanna, you know?"
Fake It 'Til You Make It,Josh Hamilton,twilight sparkle,You weren't kidding. This is worse than we thought! She's being horrible to everypony!
Fake It 'Til You Make It,Josh Hamilton,applejack,"Uh, are you sure that's even Fluttershy?"
Fake It 'Til You Make It,Josh Hamilton,pinkie pie,"Maybe it's just three really, really fast ponies that really, really look like her!"
Fake It 'Til You Make It,Josh Hamilton,rainbow dash,"Well, let's find out! Hey, Fluttershy? Are you running the shop or performing in a one-pony show?"
Fake It 'Til You Make It,Josh Hamilton,fluttershy,"[snooty voice] If you don't mind, I can only improve the taste of one customer at a time. You'll have to wait your turn. Ugh, honestly! These small town ponies come to the big city and think they can behave any way they please!"
Fake It 'Til You Make It,Josh Hamilton,rainbow dash,What?! You are a small-town pony! And your cottage isn't even in the town!
Fake It 'Til You Make It,Josh Hamilton,applejack,"Look, Fluttershy, we came here because we were worried and we care about you."
Fake It 'Til You Make It,Josh Hamilton,fluttershy,"[goth voice, to Neigh Sayer] Let's get out of this aura of positivity before it consumes us."
Fake It 'Til You Make It,Josh Hamilton,pinkie pie,"As fun as this Fluttershy switcheroo game is, Smoky, Smoky Jr., and Softpad are really concerned."
Fake It 'Til You Make It,Josh Hamilton,spike,Yeah! They came all the way to Ponyville to get us.
Fake It 'Til You Make It,Josh Hamilton,fluttershy,"[hipster voice] They should have, like, stayed there? The shop is, like, a no-rodent zone now."
Fake It 'Til You Make It,Josh Hamilton,pinkie pie,"She called them ""rodents""?!"
Fake It 'Til You Make It,Josh Hamilton,twilight sparkle,"Fluttershy, I understand why you think you have to act this way for these customers, but there's gotta be a better way."
Fake It 'Til You Make It,Josh Hamilton,fluttershy,"[snooty voice] [sarcastically] Goodness! You are so right. Please, step this way so that we may discuss your concerns."
Fake It 'Til You Make It,Josh Hamilton,twilight sparkle,I knew you'd come to your senses!
Fake It 'Til You Make It,Josh Hamilton,fluttershy,[snooty voice] Indeed.
Fake It 'Til You Make It,Josh Hamilton,rarity,"Ugh, the centerpiece of my collection, and it's still not right! Oh, darling, I'm afraid we've literally run out of time. It's up to you! Go out there and sell it! Now, attitude!"
Fake It 'Til You Make It,Josh Hamilton,rarity,"I don't understand. When I left Fluttershy, she had everything well in hoof."
Fake It 'Til You Make It,Josh Hamilton,twilight sparkle,"Well, things might have seemed all right when you left, but they're definitely not all right now."
Fake It 'Til You Make It,Josh Hamilton,applejack,She's actin' worse than the worst Manehattanite I ever saw!
Fake It 'Til You Make It,Josh Hamilton,rainbow dash,She kicked us out of the shop!
Fake It 'Til You Make It,Josh Hamilton,pinkie pie,"She called Smoky, Smoky Jr., and Softpad... ""rodents""!"
Fake It 'Til You Make It,Josh Hamilton,rarity,"Wh-wh-wha... Rodents?! Well, why didn't you say that from the start?! She obviously needs help! Come on!"
Fake It 'Til You Make It,Josh Hamilton,fluttershy,[goth voice] Your melancholy is way too shallow for a look with this much unfeeling depth.
Fake It 'Til You Make It,Josh Hamilton,fluttershy,"[hipster voice] Ugh! Your style isn't even on the same page? Turn away. Don't even look at it, okay?"
Fake It 'Til You Make It,Josh Hamilton,fluttershy,"[snooty voice] I think not, dear! This is all far too fashion forward for the likes of you!"
Fake It 'Til You Make It,Josh Hamilton,applejack,[sighs] Told ya it was bad.
Fake It 'Til You Make It,Josh Hamilton,rarity,Bad? This is worse than I could've possibly imagined!
Fake It 'Til You Make It,Josh Hamilton,fluttershy,"[snooty voice] Rarity! I'm so glad you're here! [kissing noises] Finally, a pony who understands that the couture in this shop is far too brilliant to even consider selling!"
Fake It 'Til You Make It,Josh Hamilton,rarity,Whaaat?!
Fake It 'Til You Make It,Josh Hamilton,fluttershy,"[hipster voice] You, like, totally get how lame customers are? Ugh! [goth voice] Watching them leave filled me with a sweet sadness. [snooty voice] And you'll be pleased to hear that I've taken care of your rodent situation."
Fake It 'Til You Make It,Josh Hamilton,pinkie pie,Will somebody tell her to stop saying that?!
Fake It 'Til You Make It,Josh Hamilton,rarity,"That's it! Fluttershy, I'm afraid you've left me no choice! You are terminated!"
Fake It 'Til You Make It,Josh Hamilton,fluttershy,[snooty voice] Well! Good luck replacing me! Humph!
Fake It 'Til You Make It,Josh Hamilton,fluttershy,[goth voice] I always thought she was too controlling.
Fake It 'Til You Make It,Josh Hamilton,rarity,"You<U+0097> you<U+0097> you are terminated, too!"
Fake It 'Til You Make It,Josh Hamilton,fluttershy,[goth voice] Whatever.
Fake It 'Til You Make It,Josh Hamilton,fluttershy,"[hipster voice] I know, right? I mean, uh, ugh?"
Fake It 'Til You Make It,Josh Hamilton,rarity,"Actually, you're, like, totally terminated as well!"
Fake It 'Til You Make It,Josh Hamilton,fluttershy,"[hipster voice] Like, okay."
Fake It 'Til You Make It,Josh Hamilton,fluttershy,[normal voice] I guess I owe everypony an apology.
Fake It 'Til You Make It,Josh Hamilton,rarity,[sighs] You think?
Fake It 'Til You Make It,Josh Hamilton,fluttershy,I got so caught up trying to please all of your customers that<U+0097>
Fake It 'Til You Make It,Josh Hamilton,rainbow dash,What customers?
Fake It 'Til You Make It,Josh Hamilton,fluttershy,I might have taken my salespony characters a little too far.
Fake It 'Til You Make It,Josh Hamilton,fluttershy,"[to raccoons] I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings. You know I was only pretending, right?"
Fake It 'Til You Make It,Josh Hamilton,twilight sparkle,"But, Fluttershy, why did you think you needed to be somepony else to run the shop?"
Fake It 'Til You Make It,Josh Hamilton,fluttershy,I guess acting like the ponies of Saddle Row gave me the confidence to interact with them.
Fake It 'Til You Make It,Josh Hamilton,rarity,"Darling, I'd never trust some horrible Saddle Row pony to run my shop. That's why I wanted a friend to do it."
Fake It 'Til You Make It,Josh Hamilton,fluttershy,"Well, I'd definitely rather be myself anyway, even if I don't exactly have what it takes to be a shop pony."
Fake It 'Til You Make It,Josh Hamilton,twilight sparkle,I wouldn't sell yourself short. Those salespony characters all came from you!
Fake It 'Til You Make It,Josh Hamilton,rainbow dash,Yeah! I think you totally have what it takes.
Fake It 'Til You Make It,Josh Hamilton,pinkie pie,Maybe a little too much.
Fake It 'Til You Make It,Josh Hamilton,rarity,"Indeed. You have all the inner strength you need, but I think we prefer it coming from our sweet, regular Fluttershy."
Fake It 'Til You Make It,Josh Hamilton,rarity,And that's just given me the inspiration I'm looking for!
Fake It 'Til You Make It,Josh Hamilton,rarity,And last one... There! The missing piece for my new collection <U+0096> the Warrior of Inner Strength!
Fake It 'Til You Make It,Josh Hamilton,fluttershy,"Oh, it's lovely, Rarity! I'm just sorry you had to leave the Canterlot Royal Fashion Show early."
Fake It 'Til You Make It,Josh Hamilton,rarity,"Oh, darling, making the perfect dress is scads more satisfying than showing it off."
Fake It 'Til You Make It,Josh Hamilton,rarity,"What? No, I<U+0097>"
Fake It 'Til You Make It,Josh Hamilton,fluttershy,[snooty voice] Have you considered the possibility that the Royal Fashion Show is trying to undercut Rarity's by continuing on in Canterlot and not moving the whole affair here?! Hmm?! Have you?! Hmmm?!
Fake It 'Til You Make It,Josh Hamilton,fluttershy,[snooty voice] Hmph! Just as I thought! Hmmm!
Fake It 'Til You Make It,Josh Hamilton,fluttershy,[to Rarity] Oh! [giggles] Inner strength.
Grannies Gone Wild,Gillian M. Berrow,soarin,"I'm sooo glad I made it to Las Pegasus before the fastest, most thrilling ride of all time closes for good!"
Grannies Gone Wild,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,"Wait. The fastest, most thrilling ride of all time?"
Grannies Gone Wild,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,"[scoffs] Of course I have! It's that one where, uh... All right, you got me. What is it?"
Grannies Gone Wild,Gillian M. Berrow,soarin,Only the coolest rollercoaster ever!
Grannies Gone Wild,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,It looks incredible!
Grannies Gone Wild,Gillian M. Berrow,soarin,"Oh, it is. First, you strap yourself into the cloud rocket car, and then you're catapulted straight through a..."
Grannies Gone Wild,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,...series of daring dips and terrifying turns...
Grannies Gone Wild,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,...flipping upside-down so many times you don't know which way is up!
Grannies Gone Wild,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,'Til finally you climb to the highest peak on the rails! Then drop towards the ground at lightning speed...
Grannies Gone Wild,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,...before coming up to a screeching halt! It's the coolest ride ever to exist in the history of Equestria!
Grannies Gone Wild,Gillian M. Berrow,applejack,"So, when did you ride it?"
Grannies Gone Wild,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,Oh. [laughs] I haven't.
Grannies Gone Wild,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,The ride closes this week! Forever! But I can't go to Las Pegasus because I have to teach at Twilight's school. I'm gonna miss out on the coolest rollercoaster of all time! Unless...
Grannies Gone Wild,Gillian M. Berrow,applejack,Why do I feel like you're about to ask me a mighty big favor?
Grannies Gone Wild,Gillian M. Berrow,applejack,Absolutely!
Grannies Gone Wild,Gillian M. Berrow,applejack,On one condition. You tag along with a few other ponies goin' to Las Pegasus.
Grannies Gone Wild,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,[laughs] Surely you don't mean Granny Smith!
Grannies Gone Wild,Gillian M. Berrow,applejack,"No, no, of course not. I mean Granny Smith and the rest of the Gold Horseshoe Gals."
Grannies Gone Wild,Gillian M. Berrow,granny smith,"Hurry your haunches, hinnies!"
Grannies Gone Wild,Gillian M. Berrow,applejack,"Grand Auntie Applesauce, cousin Apple Rose, and cousin Goldie Delicious."
Grannies Gone Wild,Gillian M. Berrow,applejack,"Why, I'm sure they'd be plumb tickled to have you join their annual grandmares' trip to Las Pegasus. It'll be perfect. I'll teach your classes, and you can look after them for me."
Grannies Gone Wild,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,[scoffs] Look after them?
Grannies Gone Wild,Gillian M. Berrow,applejack,"So they don't get too carried away. Usually Big Mac goes along as a chaperone, but I'm sure he'd love a break."
Grannies Gone Wild,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,"There is no way I'm going to Las Pegasus with a bunch of old, slow grannies!"
Grannies Gone Wild,Gillian M. Berrow,applejack,So you don't mind missin' your only chance to ride the Wild Blue Yonder?
Grannies Gone Wild,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,"Ugh, fine! I'll go!"
Grannies Gone Wild,Gillian M. Berrow,applejack,Ha! That's the spirit! Now skedaddle so I can help them get ready.
Grannies Gone Wild,Gillian M. Berrow,granny smith,Applejack! Have you seen my cranky flank cream? I can't find it in this whole tootin' farmhouse.
Grannies Gone Wild,Gillian M. Berrow,applejack,"It's, uh, gonna take a while."
Grannies Gone Wild,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,[groaning] Why is this taking so long? The Wild Blue Yonder's gonna close before we even get to Las Pegasus.
Grannies Gone Wild,Gillian M. Berrow,applejack,Here. I made a list to help you keep the grandmares out of trouble. Don't wanna have to bring 'em back home before you get to go on your rollercoaster.
Grannies Gone Wild,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,That could happen?!
Grannies Gone Wild,Gillian M. Berrow,applejack,"Only if you don't follow the rules. These grannies need a lot of care. If one of 'em overdoes it, it's bye-bye Las Pegasus for the lot of ya."
Grannies Gone Wild,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,"[reading] ""Make sure they get their naps"". ""Eat only soft foods"". ""Careful when dancing""? ""Don't get too excited""? Seriously?!"
Grannies Gone Wild,Gillian M. Berrow,applejack,And don't let 'em out of your sight. Ever.
Grannies Gone Wild,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,Wait. Then how am I supposed to go on the rollercoaster?
Grannies Gone Wild,Gillian M. Berrow,applejack,You'll find time. And you might even learn a thing or two about havin' a good time from these old gals.
Grannies Gone Wild,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,Yeah. That'll happen.
Grannies Gone Wild,Gillian M. Berrow,applejack,"All right, y'all! Time to get this show on the road! [chuckles] Or in the sky, in this case."
Grannies Gone Wild,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,"[groans] Come on, come on, come on!"
Grannies Gone Wild,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,"Go, go, go, go, go!"
Grannies Gone Wild,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,Argh! Everypony okay in there?
Grannies Gone Wild,Gillian M. Berrow,granny smith,Dandy as a pansy in a plant pot!
Grannies Gone Wild,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,[echoing] They said they've heard the tree story!
Grannies Gone Wild,Gillian M. Berrow,goldie delicious,Here we go again.
Grannies Gone Wild,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,"The Wild Blue Yonder is in our hotel?! Uh, I bet you grannies are feeling super tired from your journey."
Grannies Gone Wild,Gillian M. Berrow,granny smith,"Nope! How about a trot down the avenue to see the sights, girls?"
Grannies Gone Wild,Gillian M. Berrow,goldie delicious,"Oh, forget the sights! I came here to play some serious horseshoe toss!"
Grannies Gone Wild,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,[gasps] Oh-my-gosh-oh-my-gosh-oh-my-gosh-oh-my-gosh! There it is! The best rollercoaster ever!
Grannies Gone Wild,Gillian M. Berrow,goldie delicious,"Aaah! Warm up those withers, ladies! There's a horseshoe-hurlin' trophy with our names on it!"
Grannies Gone Wild,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,[gasps] Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa. That sounds a little too exciting. Why don't we get you checked in first?
Grannies Gone Wild,Gillian M. Berrow,granny smith,"Ha-ha! You sure your name's not Applesaucey? Better find the brakes on that buggy, sugar. We just got here."
Grannies Gone Wild,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,"Uh, Granny Smith's right. Let's not overdo it. How about a nice nap so you can really enjoy Las Pegasus?"
Grannies Gone Wild,Gillian M. Berrow,goldie delicious,"[yawns] Good idea. We could use some shut-eye, hmm?"
Grannies Gone Wild,Gillian M. Berrow,granny smith,"You go along now and explore while we rest, sugar booger. Yawn."
Grannies Gone Wild,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,"Uh, if you say so! [to Lemon Squeezy] What? They'll be in here sleeping the whole time I'm gone!"
Grannies Gone Wild,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,Quit judging me!
Grannies Gone Wild,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,"[clears throat] One ticket for the coolest rollercoaster of all time, please. [gasps] But... But... this line never ends!"
Grannies Gone Wild,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,Enjoy the ride.
Grannies Gone Wild,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,Heh. They didn't even know I left.
Grannies Gone Wild,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,Whoa!
Grannies Gone Wild,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,Aah! [gasps] They're gone!
Grannies Gone Wild,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,"[panicked whimpering] Granny Smith! Apple Rose! Are you here?! Applesauce? Goldie? Oh, I'm the worst chaperone ever!"
Grannies Gone Wild,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,"I know, I know! Excuse me, sir. Have you seen a group of old mares around here?"
Grannies Gone Wild,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,[groans] This place is huge! They could be anywhere!
Grannies Gone Wild,Gillian M. Berrow,goldie delicious,Now that's how you hurl a horseshoe!
Grannies Gone Wild,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,Ha! No way! Goldie's totally got game!
Grannies Gone Wild,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,"Yeah! Go, Goldie!"
Grannies Gone Wild,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,Huh? Uh-oh!
Grannies Gone Wild,Gillian M. Berrow,goldie delicious,"Oh, oop!"
Grannies Gone Wild,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,"Uh, mind if I try?"
Grannies Gone Wild,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,Whoops. Guess I'm no good at this game. Sorry.
Grannies Gone Wild,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,"Oh, I'm so glad I found you! Everypony feeling okay? Not too excited?"
Grannies Gone Wild,Gillian M. Berrow,goldie delicious,Pretty much the opposite right now.
Grannies Gone Wild,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,"[sighs] Good. From now on, I'm not letting you grannies out of my sight."
Grannies Gone Wild,Gillian M. Berrow,goldie delicious,Ooh! We could play more games!
Grannies Gone Wild,Gillian M. Berrow,granny smith,That's what we ought to do!
Grannies Gone Wild,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,Really?
Grannies Gone Wild,Gillian M. Berrow,granny smith,Hit the buffet! All that horseshoe tossin' sure works up an appy-tite.
Grannies Gone Wild,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,[sighs] Uh-huh...
Grannies Gone Wild,Gillian M. Berrow,granny smith,I love me some nachos. I'mma set my dentures loose on these vittles until the crumbs cry uncle!
Grannies Gone Wild,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,"Come on, Granny. You know you can't have those. They're super crunchy."
Grannies Gone Wild,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,"How about some nice soft carrot soup, instead?"
Grannies Gone Wild,Gillian M. Berrow,granny smith,I thought you was supposed to be the fun one.
Grannies Gone Wild,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,Wait. I am fun!
Grannies Gone Wild,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,Sounds kind of intense. Aren't you all exhausted from your big day?
Grannies Gone Wild,Gillian M. Berrow,goldie delicious,"Heck no! We save up our energy all year for Las Pegasus weekend, isn't that right, girls?"
Grannies Gone Wild,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,"Ugh. Dancing it is, then. I'll be there."
Grannies Gone Wild,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,"Ugh! Stop doing that! Uh, that's probably enough dancing for now! Right, Apple Rose?"
Grannies Gone Wild,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,So gross.
Grannies Gone Wild,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,"Oh, come on! You said you were going back to the room after dancing! So each pony could have some alone time?"
Grannies Gone Wild,Gillian M. Berrow,goldie delicious,"Oh, now don't be a stick in the mud! Trust me, you'll loooove this show! It's the best thing in Las Pegasus!"
Grannies Gone Wild,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,"Hey, where are you going? Come back!"
Grannies Gone Wild,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,"Release those grannies, right now!"
Grannies Gone Wild,Gillian M. Berrow,granny smith,What'd ya go and do that for?! That was our big star moment!
Grannies Gone Wild,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,Y-You were in danger! I saw the water! You were trapped!
Grannies Gone Wild,Gillian M. Berrow,goldie delicious,"Oh, pish-tosh! This is a magic show! We've seen it a thousand times! Everypony always escapes."
Grannies Gone Wild,Gillian M. Berrow,goldie delicious,You keep ruinin' our fun! I had a hot hoof goin' in that game you decided to lose for us!
Grannies Gone Wild,Gillian M. Berrow,granny smith,And I wanted to eat those nachos at the buffet!
Grannies Gone Wild,Gillian M. Berrow,granny smith,"They're bein' too polite to say it, so I will! Rainbow Dash, we thought you'd be a hoot, but I ain't never met a wetter hen!"
Grannies Gone Wild,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,What?!
Grannies Gone Wild,Gillian M. Berrow,goldie delicious,She's right! You've had your mane in a twist ever since we arrived!
Grannies Gone Wild,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,"I'm so sorry, everypony. The truth is, all I wanted to do for this whole trip is ride the Wild Blue Yonder. I mean, it's why I came to Las Pegasus in the first place! Applejack told me not to let you out of my sight, or you might overdo it and we'd have to go home early."
Grannies Gone Wild,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,"Well, now it's too late. I ruined your trip, and it's the last day ever to ride the Wild Blue Yonder! The line is so long, I'll never get to go on it."
Grannies Gone Wild,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,"Hey, what's so funny?"
Grannies Gone Wild,Gillian M. Berrow,granny smith,[chuckling] Is that all you wanted?
Grannies Gone Wild,Gillian M. Berrow,goldie delicious,"Well, fish-flavored kitten kibble. Why didn't you say so sooner? Come on, girls!"
Grannies Gone Wild,Gillian M. Berrow,granny smith,We're Gold Horseshoe members. The most exclusive club in Las Pegasus. And she's with us.
Grannies Gone Wild,Gillian M. Berrow,goldie delicious,We've been comin' here every moon since we can remember. Even some we don't remember.
Grannies Gone Wild,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,Like fancy suites and rollercoaster rides?
Grannies Gone Wild,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,"Um, yes! [squeals] This is amazing! Isn't this amazing?"
Grannies Gone Wild,Gillian M. Berrow,granny smith,"Sugar, you probably want to hold on 'bout now."
Grannies Gone Wild,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,I'm sorry I misjudged you for being older ponies. You mares are actually pretty cool.
Grannies Gone Wild,Gillian M. Berrow,granny smith,Rainbow Dash?
Grannies Gone Wild,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,"Yeah, Granny?"
Grannies Gone Wild,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,Ha-ha! Really?
Grannies Gone Wild,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,I wouldn't miss it for anything!
Surf and/or Turf,Brian Hohlfeld,scootaloo,Princess Twilight!
Surf and/or Turf,Brian Hohlfeld,cutie mark crusaders,We're glowing!
Surf and/or Turf,Brian Hohlfeld,twilight sparkle,[giggling] That's what happens when you're summoned by the Map.
Surf and/or Turf,Brian Hohlfeld,sweetie belle,Somepony needs our help?
Surf and/or Turf,Brian Hohlfeld,apple bloom,We're being called by the Map?
Surf and/or Turf,Brian Hohlfeld,scootaloo,Did I mention we're glowing?!
Surf and/or Turf,Brian Hohlfeld,scootaloo,So where exactly in Equestria are we needed?
Surf and/or Turf,Brian Hohlfeld,twilight sparkle,"Actually, where you're going isn't even in Equestria."
Surf and/or Turf,Brian Hohlfeld,sweetie belle,Wow! That's almost... off the table!
Surf and/or Turf,Brian Hohlfeld,apple bloom,But what's way out there?
Surf and/or Turf,Brian Hohlfeld,twilight sparkle,"Mount Aris, the home of the Hippogriffs! And that's where you're headed!"
Surf and/or Turf,Brian Hohlfeld,cutie mark crusaders,Whoa...!
Surf and/or Turf,Brian Hohlfeld,sweetie belle,"You really don't need to come with us, Twilight. We can take care of this mission just fine on our own."
Surf and/or Turf,Brian Hohlfeld,apple bloom,Mm-hmm.
Surf and/or Turf,Brian Hohlfeld,scootaloo,Yeah!
Surf and/or Turf,Brian Hohlfeld,scootaloo,Oof!
Surf and/or Turf,Brian Hohlfeld,sweetie belle,Ugh!
Surf and/or Turf,Brian Hohlfeld,twilight sparkle,"I know that. But I'm not so sure the ponies who care about you want you going off so far on your own. Besides, there's some school business I need to take care of on Mount Aris. This permission slip is for Silverstream. It's very important that her mother and father sign it, or else no field trips."
Surf and/or Turf,Brian Hohlfeld,scootaloo,"[whispering, to Apple Bloom and Sweetie Belle] Sounds like somepony just wants a vacation."
Surf and/or Turf,Brian Hohlfeld,twilight sparkle,"Okay, yes, I have been wanting to visit Mount Aris ever since the Hippogriffs moved back. But it's purely research. Silverstream's brother is gonna meet us there and take us to their houses."
Surf and/or Turf,Brian Hohlfeld,apple bloom,Wow! They have more than one house?
Surf and/or Turf,Brian Hohlfeld,twilight sparkle,I guess so. The social structure of the Hippogriffs and seaponies is a bit of a mystery.
Surf and/or Turf,Brian Hohlfeld,sweetie belle,"I don't know if I'd like being a Hippogriff. Part bird, part pony..."
Surf and/or Turf,Brian Hohlfeld,scootaloo,"I'm happy with just my pony parts, thanks."
Surf and/or Turf,Brian Hohlfeld,apple bloom,"I think Hippogriffs are pretty neat. I learned all about them from Applejack. The Hippogriffs all once lived happily on Mount Aris. But when the Storm King invaded, they used a magic pearl to turn into seaponies and escape to the underwater safety of Seaquestria. Then, in the Battle of Canterlot, when Applejack defeated the Storm King<U+0097>"
Surf and/or Turf,Brian Hohlfeld,twilight sparkle,"Wait, what? She told you she defeated him? By herself?"
Surf and/or Turf,Brian Hohlfeld,apple bloom,"Uh, maybe she didn't say that exactly. But it makes for a better story."
Surf and/or Turf,Brian Hohlfeld,cutie mark crusaders,Whoa!
Surf and/or Turf,Brian Hohlfeld,sweetie belle,All right. So what kind of cutie mark-related friendship problem do you think we're supposed to solve.
Surf and/or Turf,Brian Hohlfeld,twilight sparkle,I don't know. But Hippogriffs don't have cutie marks. So it might not have anything to do with that at all.
Surf and/or Turf,Brian Hohlfeld,apple bloom,"Huh. Still, the Map called us, so it must be a kind of problem that only we can solve."
Surf and/or Turf,Brian Hohlfeld,cutie mark crusaders,"Go, Crusaders!"
Surf and/or Turf,Brian Hohlfeld,sweetie belle,But how do we know exactly who we're supposed to help?
Surf and/or Turf,Brian Hohlfeld,scootaloo,"Ahem. Attention, please! Anygriff here have a problem?"
Surf and/or Turf,Brian Hohlfeld,scootaloo,Eh. That's all I got.
Surf and/or Turf,Brian Hohlfeld,apple bloom,"Maybe if the Map could be a little more specific about our mission, like maybe... an address?"
Surf and/or Turf,Brian Hohlfeld,twilight sparkle,The Map doesn't really work like that. But I'm sure you and whoever needs help will find each other.
Surf and/or Turf,Brian Hohlfeld,apple bloom,A Hippogriff can have a seapony for a brother? How does that work exactly?
Surf and/or Turf,Brian Hohlfeld,sweetie belle,Shhh! It's rude to ask a question like that!
Surf and/or Turf,Brian Hohlfeld,scootaloo,Whoa!
Surf and/or Turf,Brian Hohlfeld,apple bloom,Can I ask now?
Surf and/or Turf,Brian Hohlfeld,twilight sparkle,But others got used to living under the water and stayed in Seaquestria.
Surf and/or Turf,Brian Hohlfeld,twilight sparkle,"Well, I'm pretty eager to see the Hippogriff village. You know, to... get this form signed. And... research! So..."
Surf and/or Turf,Brian Hohlfeld,apple bloom,"Hey, Terramar? Does anygriff you know up there have a problem they need help with?"
Surf and/or Turf,Brian Hohlfeld,twilight sparkle,"Whoa! This looks amazing! Last time I was here, it was a ghost town!"
Surf and/or Turf,Brian Hohlfeld,scootaloo,Wow! We picked a good day to show up!
Surf and/or Turf,Brian Hohlfeld,cutie mark crusaders,Aah!
Surf and/or Turf,Brian Hohlfeld,twilight sparkle,Absolutely! And to have you sign a form for Silverstream.
Surf and/or Turf,Brian Hohlfeld,twilight sparkle,Eh. Research. See you later! And good luck! I know you'll find your mission!
Surf and/or Turf,Brian Hohlfeld,sweetie belle,"Well, your dad's certainly... outgoing, isn't he?"
Surf and/or Turf,Brian Hohlfeld,sweetie belle,"Wait, stop."
Surf and/or Turf,Brian Hohlfeld,sweetie belle,What's that wonderful sound?
Surf and/or Turf,Brian Hohlfeld,sweetie belle,Woo-hoo! Yeah! Awesome! I love this!
Surf and/or Turf,Brian Hohlfeld,sweetie belle,This is absolutely the best place ever! You are so lucky!
Surf and/or Turf,Brian Hohlfeld,scootaloo,And you get to swim in the ocean! You have two great places to live!
Surf and/or Turf,Brian Hohlfeld,apple bloom,How do you make up your mind which one to stay in?
Surf and/or Turf,Brian Hohlfeld,apple bloom,"Did you say... ""problem""?"
Surf and/or Turf,Brian Hohlfeld,sweetie belle,You have a problem?!
Surf and/or Turf,Brian Hohlfeld,scootaloo,Yes!
Surf and/or Turf,Brian Hohlfeld,sweetie belle,Woo-hoo! We discovered our mission!
Surf and/or Turf,Brian Hohlfeld,scootaloo,All right!
Surf and/or Turf,Brian Hohlfeld,apple bloom,We did it!
Surf and/or Turf,Brian Hohlfeld,scootaloo,Sorry. You were talking about your problem?
Surf and/or Turf,Brian Hohlfeld,sweetie belle,Ohhhh. I-I didn't know that.
Surf and/or Turf,Brian Hohlfeld,apple bloom,No wonder you're having such a hard time deciding.
Surf and/or Turf,Brian Hohlfeld,scootaloo,"When in doubt, chart it out!"
Surf and/or Turf,Brian Hohlfeld,scootaloo,"Now, we put down everything great about each place and everything not so great. Compare them, and... your decision is made for you!"
Surf and/or Turf,Brian Hohlfeld,sweetie belle,"Well, it's obvious, isn't it? Mount Aris is the best of all possible worlds. Pro <U+0096> it's beautiful. Con <U+0096> too far from Equestria. I think that pretty much sums it up."
Surf and/or Turf,Brian Hohlfeld,apple bloom,"Terramar's right, Sweetie Belle. It'd be fair if we visited both places before we decide."
Surf and/or Turf,Brian Hohlfeld,twilight sparkle,"Hey, everypony! This festival is fantastic! Look what I won at the ring toss booth! Ahem. But of course, I'm really here on business. Sky Beak's already signed the form. Now I just need your mom's signature. Is she around?"
Surf and/or Turf,Brian Hohlfeld,apple bloom,Um... she's a seapony. In Seaquestria.
Surf and/or Turf,Brian Hohlfeld,twilight sparkle,"That's what Silverstream meant by ""houses""!"
Surf and/or Turf,Brian Hohlfeld,apple bloom,And how exactly are we gonna visit underwater?
Surf and/or Turf,Brian Hohlfeld,scootaloo,Whoa! [giggling] Woo-hoo! Yeah! [giggling] Whoa! This must be just like flying! Woo-hoo!
Surf and/or Turf,Brian Hohlfeld,apple bloom,"Where's your mom's house, Terramar?"
Surf and/or Turf,Brian Hohlfeld,scootaloo,This is awesome!
Surf and/or Turf,Brian Hohlfeld,twilight sparkle,"Well, she is one of our most hardworking students. In fact, I brought this form for you to sign so that<U+0097>"
Surf and/or Turf,Brian Hohlfeld,twilight sparkle,"That sounds adorable! I'd love to! And you know, to find out about aquatic pony early development and, uh..."
Surf and/or Turf,Brian Hohlfeld,cutie mark crusaders,[giggling] Research.
Surf and/or Turf,Brian Hohlfeld,scootaloo,Look out! [giggling] Can't catch me!
Surf and/or Turf,Brian Hohlfeld,sweetie belle,"Huh. Not much sunlight down here, is there?"
Surf and/or Turf,Brian Hohlfeld,scootaloo,Boom-ba-da-boom-ba-da-boom-ba-da-boom-ba-da-boom-ba-da-boom-ba-da-boom!
Surf and/or Turf,Brian Hohlfeld,scootaloo,[bubbly] Everything sounds funny down here!
Surf and/or Turf,Brian Hohlfeld,sweetie belle,"Okay. I've seen everything I need to. So, uh, why don't we find Twilight Sparkle, finish the chart, and, uh, head back up the mountain? I have some serious field twirling to do."
Surf and/or Turf,Brian Hohlfeld,twilight sparkle,Why not? Could be another trophy in my future! Be back soon!
Surf and/or Turf,Brian Hohlfeld,scootaloo,All right! Let's add some positives to the Seaquestria side!
Surf and/or Turf,Brian Hohlfeld,apple bloom,Uh-huh!
Surf and/or Turf,Brian Hohlfeld,scootaloo,"Swimming is like flying, multi-color fish, and did I mention the flying thing?!"
Surf and/or Turf,Brian Hohlfeld,sweetie belle,"You forgot the cons. Dark, wet, sea monsters..."
Surf and/or Turf,Brian Hohlfeld,scootaloo,"I don't remember any sea monsters. Apple Bloom, looks like it's up to you."
Surf and/or Turf,Brian Hohlfeld,apple bloom,Me? Well... Both places have a lot of good things about them. I can understand why it's hard for you to decide.
Surf and/or Turf,Brian Hohlfeld,apple bloom,"Your heart is in two places, you can only live in one You're torn between the hilltops and the tide"
Surf and/or Turf,Brian Hohlfeld,sweetie belle,Thank goodness that the Cutie Mark Crusaders have begun To give you hope and help you to decide
Surf and/or Turf,Brian Hohlfeld,scootaloo,"Well, on the other hoof, I can think of a place that's way more exciting and cool, not to mention more you! Come on, you know exactly where I mean!"
Surf and/or Turf,Brian Hohlfeld,sweetie belle,Build your nest here on Harmonizing Heights
Surf and/or Turf,Brian Hohlfeld,scootaloo,Live it up here in Seaquestria
Surf and/or Turf,Brian Hohlfeld,sweetie belle,Nothing compares to Harmonizing Heights The eagles are regal
Surf and/or Turf,Brian Hohlfeld,scootaloo,But the schools are cooler
Surf and/or Turf,Brian Hohlfeld,sweetie belle,Their claws are so awesome
Surf and/or Turf,Brian Hohlfeld,scootaloo,With their sweet maneuvers
Surf and/or Turf,Brian Hohlfeld,sweetie belle,Star wishes every night
Surf and/or Turf,Brian Hohlfeld,scootaloo,Starfish by eel light
Surf and/or Turf,Brian Hohlfeld,sweetie belle,Better
Surf and/or Turf,Brian Hohlfeld,scootaloo,Wetter
Surf and/or Turf,Brian Hohlfeld,sweetie belle,Shinier
Surf and/or Turf,Brian Hohlfeld,scootaloo,Brinier Seaquestria!
Surf and/or Turf,Brian Hohlfeld,sweetie belle,Harmonizing Heights!
Surf and/or Turf,Brian Hohlfeld,scootaloo,Seaquestria!
Surf and/or Turf,Brian Hohlfeld,sweetie belle,Harmonizing Heights!
Surf and/or Turf,Brian Hohlfeld,apple bloom,"Terramar, where're you goin'?"
Surf and/or Turf,Brian Hohlfeld,scootaloo,Hmph!
Surf and/or Turf,Brian Hohlfeld,apple bloom,Sweetie Belle said to tell you it's your fault that Terramar ran off.
Surf and/or Turf,Brian Hohlfeld,scootaloo,"Well, you tell Sweetie Belle that if it weren't for her, our mission would've been over by now! And a success!"
Surf and/or Turf,Brian Hohlfeld,apple bloom,[sighs] Scootaloo says this whole thing is your fault.
Surf and/or Turf,Brian Hohlfeld,sweetie belle,"Well, tell her that I'm not the one who dashed all of Terramar's hopes and made him give up on the world! Both worlds!"
Surf and/or Turf,Brian Hohlfeld,apple bloom,"[sighs] Sweetie Belle says it's your fault that Terramar ran<U+0097> Oh. Wait. I already told you that, didn't I?"
Surf and/or Turf,Brian Hohlfeld,twilight sparkle,"Uh, what's going on? Where's Terramar?"
Surf and/or Turf,Brian Hohlfeld,apple bloom,"Uh, well... he... he kinda left. He wanted to be by himself."
Surf and/or Turf,Brian Hohlfeld,scootaloo,Which was not my fault!
Surf and/or Turf,Brian Hohlfeld,sweetie belle,"Mine, either!"
Surf and/or Turf,Brian Hohlfeld,twilight sparkle,"Well, of course not. Why would you think that?"
Surf and/or Turf,Brian Hohlfeld,scootaloo,All we had to do was help him choose which world to live in.
Surf and/or Turf,Brian Hohlfeld,sweetie belle,And we let him down.
Surf and/or Turf,Brian Hohlfeld,twilight sparkle,Whoever said that he had to choose?
Surf and/or Turf,Brian Hohlfeld,apple bloom,"Well, he did."
Surf and/or Turf,Brian Hohlfeld,twilight sparkle,Hmmm... Maybe Terramar's making it harder than it has to be.
Surf and/or Turf,Brian Hohlfeld,twilight sparkle,"Actually, we're right in the middle of<U+0097>"
Surf and/or Turf,Brian Hohlfeld,twilight sparkle,"Thank you, really. I've had a great time in both places today, but... [whispering, to Cutie Mark Crusaders] Wow. This must be how Terramar feels all the time."
Surf and/or Turf,Brian Hohlfeld,sweetie belle,Hmmm... This gives me an idea.
Surf and/or Turf,Brian Hohlfeld,scootaloo,Huh. I thought for sure he came this way.
Surf and/or Turf,Brian Hohlfeld,sweetie belle,[gasps] He did.
Surf and/or Turf,Brian Hohlfeld,scootaloo,"We're sorry. We were supposed to help you, and..."
Surf and/or Turf,Brian Hohlfeld,sweetie belle,...we just ended up confusing you more. It's all our fault.
Surf and/or Turf,Brian Hohlfeld,apple bloom,We might have somethin' worth comin' down for.
Surf and/or Turf,Brian Hohlfeld,sweetie belle,We thought we'd get every creature together for a picnic on the beach.
Surf and/or Turf,Brian Hohlfeld,scootaloo,And we mean every creature!
Surf and/or Turf,Brian Hohlfeld,scootaloo,Something we forgot to add that both places have <U+0096> family and friends who love you.
Surf and/or Turf,Brian Hohlfeld,cutie mark crusaders,Yes! We did it!
Surf and/or Turf,Brian Hohlfeld,twilight sparkle,Congratulations! Your first map mission is a success!
Surf and/or Turf,Brian Hohlfeld,sweetie belle,Guess that means we're officially done here. I hope you come visit your sister in Equestria.
Surf and/or Turf,Brian Hohlfeld,apple bloom,"Yeah, come see us! You'll love it!"
Surf and/or Turf,Brian Hohlfeld,scootaloo,Who knows? You might even want to live there!
Surf and/or Turf,Brian Hohlfeld,scootaloo,"Yeah, that was a joke."
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,twilight sparkle,"Princess Celestia, I have an idea for your ones-versary."
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,princess celestia,"My... ""ones-versary""?"
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,twilight sparkle,"The one-thousand, one-hundred, eleventh year anniversary of when you first raised the sun."
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,spike,"Good thing Pinkie Pie reminded us, or we would have forgot to celebrate."
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,princess celestia,You're not the only ones. What did you have in mind?
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,twilight sparkle,"To commemorate your first sunrise, I've written a play. We'd like to perform it at my School of Friendship, if you don't mind."
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,princess celestia,[giggling happily] Mind? Oh! Of course not! Oh! I think a play is a fantastic idea!
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,spike,Did she just... prance?
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,princess celestia,"Oh, uh, forgive me for getting so excited. It's just, when I was a filly, my friends often put on plays. [sighs] It was so wonderful. Everypony coming together to create a magical experience to share with others. I've always believed theater brings out the best in us and forges a special bond of friendship."
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,twilight sparkle,[gasps] I didn't know you used to act!
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,princess celestia,"Oh, not me. I was always too busy with my magic lessons to be part of any plays myself. But still, it's something I always wished I could experience."
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,twilight sparkle,"And you still can! Princess Celestia, we would be honored if you would be the star of our play!"
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,spike,We would?!
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,princess celestia,You want me to star in your play?!
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,spike,"Yeah... When did that happen, exactly?"
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,twilight sparkle,"If you'll excuse us for a second... [whispering] Don't you see, Spike? It's perfect! Princess Celestia has always wanted to be in a play, and this one's about her!"
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,spike,"[whispering] I guess, but how are we supposed to give her directions? She's the ruler of Equestria!"
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,twilight sparkle,"[whispering] She's also our friend. Celestia's always kind to everypony. So if we have a chance to finally do something for her, we should."
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,spike,Hmmm...
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,twilight sparkle,"[whispering] Come on. How many times has Celestia helped us? Guided us? Been a warm, calming voice over our shoulder?"
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,princess celestia,Twilight.
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,twilight sparkle,"<U+00A0>Yes, Princess Celestia?"
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,princess celestia,"Your invitation is very kind, but are you certain it's wise? I have no acting experience at all."
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,twilight sparkle,Experience? Pssh! You'll be playing yourself. And we'll all help you. Please? It'd mean so much to the students if you were in our show.
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,princess celestia,"Well, if you're sure..."
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,spike,"Yeah, what she said."
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,princess celestia,Then I would be delighted to join your theater troupe!
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,pinkie pie,Woo-hoo! Confetti is ready! Woo-hoo!
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,applejack,"Puh! Wormy apple cores, Pinkie! How many times have I told you to keep your special effects away from my sets?!"
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,applejack,Ugh.
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,starlight glimmer,"I can't believe you've memorized your lines already, Fluttershy."
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,fluttershy,"Once you get past terrifying, paralyzing stage fright, the rest is easy. Now I just hope Princess Celestia says we can do our play."
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,rarity,"Oh, as soon as she sees these fabulous costumes, all she'll be able to say is ""Brava!"""
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,rainbow dash,Heads up! Here comes our answer!
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,twilight sparkle,"[panting] Wonderful news, everypony!"
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,applejack,Yeehaw! We get to put on our show?
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,twilight sparkle,Even better. Princess Celestia is gonna be our star!
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,spike,"Yeah, that's how I felt, too."
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,rainbow dash,Celestia? Starring in our play? This is huge!
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,twilight sparkle,"Well, she was a little nervous at first, but I told her not to worry. With us helping, it will all go smooth as<U+0097>"
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,rarity,"Silk! I must find the silk! If Celestia's going to be in our play, we have to take everything up to the next level! None of these old ideas will do!"
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,pinkie pie,"Yeah! Forget my regular party cannon! For princess-sized effects, we're gonna need Big Bertha!"
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,applejack,Grrrr...! Pinkie!
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,pinkie pie,What?
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,rainbow dash,Our play is gonna be amazing! I gotta tell everypony I know! And even the ones I don't!
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,applejack,Why in tarnation are y'all gettin' so starstruck? We've met Princess Celestia before. Plenty of times.
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,starlight glimmer,"Those were formal things <U+0096> galas, world-saving. This is different! Imagine doing sweaty warm-ups with a princess, blowing your nose in front of a princess, sitting around just... talking with a princess."
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,twilight sparkle,I'm a princess. You talk to me.
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,starlight glimmer,"That's different. You're not a ""princess"" princess."
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,twilight sparkle,"Uh, thanks. Celestia wants to experience the special friendship that theater ponies have. To give her that, you just need to be yourselves."
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,fluttershy,You... You really think so?
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,applejack,"Heh. Aw, quit frettin'. It's only a couple o' pals gettin' together to put on a ones-versary play. What could go wrong?"
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,spike,"[amplified] Places, everypony! We're here to rehearse ""A New Day in Equestria""!"
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,spike,"[amplified] Directed, written, and produced by Twilight Sparkle."
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,twilight sparkle,"Page one, act one, scene one. Action!"
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,fluttershy,"Once upon a time, before Celestia, Equestria was suffering terrible hardship. Raising the sun every morning was so hard, it took five great sorcerers plus Star Swirl the Bearded to do it."
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,fluttershy,"And every day, the unicorns helping Star Swirl would use so much magic, they lost their powers forever. Things looked bleak. Soon, Equestria would lose all its magic users! Then, the land would be covered in darkness for eternity!"
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,twilight sparkle,"[to Spike] Even I can't believe how good my play is! The sets, the props, the outfits <U+0096> they're all great!"
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,spike,And... here comes the best part.
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,fluttershy,"But then, a student named Celestia discovered she had the power to raise the sun herself without draining her magic!"
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,twilight sparkle,"Um, that's your cue, Celestia."
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,princess celestia,"Oh! Uh, right! Of course! Heh. [clears throat] [quietly] It is time for a new day in Equestria."
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,spike,"Um, what?"
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,princess celestia,"Oh, uh, I said [quietly] it is time for a new day in Equestria."
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,twilight sparkle,And your delivery was... great! But maybe you should try it a tiny bit louder for the ponies in the back row.
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,princess celestia,"Oh, yes, yes. My Royal Canterlot Voice. Thank you for the reminder, Twilight. [booming] It is time for a new day in Equestria!"
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,princess celestia,Oh! Goodness! This theater does have strong acoustics. M-My apologies. I'm still learning to hone my craft.
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,twilight sparkle,"No, no! You're doing... fine! Why don't we try it one more time? Just like you're talking to me."
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,princess celestia,[flat and stilted] It is time for a new day in Equestria-aaa.
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,twilight sparkle,A bit more energy.
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,princess celestia,"[rushed and hyperactive] It's time for a new day in Equestria! [normal] Uh, how was that?"
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,applejack,"Uh, honestly?"
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,twilight sparkle,Great! Wow! It's hard to believe you've never done this before! Let's move onto the dance number!
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,spike,"Again! Step, buck, leap, touch! Again! Step, buck, leap, touch! Got it? Movin' on! Five, six, seven, eight!"
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,princess celestia,"[with wildly varying tone] Come on, Star Swirl. Throw off that must-Y hat and let's have a... a dance!"
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,princess celestia,"Oh, dear. I think we have a problem!"
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,applejack,[whispering] Yeah. Our lead actress is a disaster!
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,twilight sparkle,"[hyperventilating] What are we gonna do?! If I tell Celestia she's terrible, it'll hurt her feelings, and I'll be a bad friend. But if I keep her in the show, she'll be the laughingstock of Equestria, and I'll be a worse friend."
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,applejack,"Ya need to tell Celestia the truth, Twilight."
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,twilight sparkle,Any other suggestions?
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,spike,Why don't we just cancel the show?
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,twilight sparkle,Real suggestions?
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,spike,"No, think about it. Right now, most of Equestria doesn't even know we're doing a ones-versary play. If we shut it down..."
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,rarity,...Nopony will ever miss it!
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,starlight glimmer,So they'll never find out Princess Celestia's a bad actress!
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,fluttershy,And she won't be embarrassed!
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,pinkie pie,Ah! It's the perfect plan!
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,rainbow dash,All right! I just finished telling everypony to come to our play!
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,twilight sparkle,You... did?
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,rainbow dash,"Yeah! You should've seen how excited they got when they found out Celestia was in it! They said they'd tell their friends, and then their friends would tell their friends! Everypony in Equestria's gonna see this thing! Uh... did I miss something?"
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,twilight sparkle,"Just the bright light of hope being snuffed. But that's okay. If we can't cancel the show, I know what I have to do."
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,applejack,Be honest with Celestia and give the lead role to somepony else?
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,twilight sparkle,Not a chance!
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,applejack,"Twilight, you know truth is a huge part of friendship."
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,twilight sparkle,"And so is making another pony's dreams come true. Look, I promised Celestia that this time, she could be a part of the play instead of just watching it. And I plan to keep that promise."
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,fluttershy,But how?
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,princess celestia,You want to give me acting lessons?
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,twilight sparkle,No-no-no-no-no-no-no. More like a special workshop with other actors. To... take your performance from good to flawless.
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,princess celestia,"Thank you so much, Twilight! This is what I always knew theater must be about <U+0096> that special stage pony bond of shared trust and honesty."
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,spike,Yeah. Heh. That's what it is. Ahem.
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,twilight sparkle,"Princess Celestia, meet Method Mare performers On Stage and Raspberry Beret!"
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,princess celestia,"The pleasure is all mine! If there's anything I can do to become a better Equestrian thespian, I will! What do you have planned?"
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,princess celestia,What box?
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,twilight sparkle,How's it going over here?
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,rainbow dash,That sun will never rise again.
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,pinkie pie,That's why I have something even better!
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,rarity,[gasps] It's the perfect substitute!
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,rarity,It was the perfect substitute.
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,twilight sparkle,Please give me something to be happy about.
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,princess celestia,Should I get you a blanket?
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,princess celestia,It is? But I don't see anything.
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,princess celestia,Mmmm... nothing. Oh! The classroom floor under my hooves! Does that count?
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,twilight sparkle,Do I wanna know?
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,pinkie pie,Wait for it...
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,applejack,Pinkie Pie!
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,pinkie pie,Whaaaat? It's realistic! The sun is just like a burning marshmallow!
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,twilight sparkle,What are they doing now?
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,spike,[sighs] The simplest acting exercise they could think of <U+0096> a game of charades.
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,princess celestia,"My love for Equestria and all the ponies in it! Twilight, you felt what I was emoting, didn't you?"
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,twilight sparkle,[stuttering] Yeah!
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,spike,"[to On Stage] Now, that's the best acting we've seen all day."
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,twilight sparkle,Okay! I tried and tried and tried! But we have to face facts. We can't make Celestia an actress. So there's only one thing to do!
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,applejack,Tell her the truth finally?
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,twilight sparkle,No!
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,twilight sparkle,I've rewritten the script to give Celestia a more artistic part with no lines.
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,pinkie pie,"And to make sure the show's a hit, I've whipped up the biggest, bestest, flashiest fake sun ever!"
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,twilight sparkle,"Uh, Pinkie? That looks unsafe."
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,pinkie pie,Why would untested magic fireworks that I bought in a back alley from Trixie at midnight be unsafe?
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,princess celestia,"Twilight, if you honestly thought I was a bad actress, why didn't you tell me?"
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,twilight sparkle,"I-I'm so sorry! I didn't mean to insult your acting! It's just, I-I got so stressed! But... that's no excuse for what I said. You have every right to be upset with me."
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,princess celestia,I'm not upset because you insulted my acting.
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,twilight sparkle,You're not?
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,princess celestia,"I'm upset because, in all the time we've known each other, I thought I taught you about the importance of friendship, trust, and honesty!"
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,twilight sparkle,"Celestia, wait!"
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,pinkie pie,No!
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,pinkie pie,You can't fly away now! Look!
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,fluttershy,Ponies are taking their seats for the show.
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,rainbow dash,[laughs] Standing room only! Did I do a good job of advertising for this thing or what? Sorry.
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,starlight glimmer,We can't put on a show with no lead actress!
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,applejack,You go find Celestia. We'll figure out a way to stall this thing 'til you get back.
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,spike,Good luck. Nopony's gonna volunteer to try to tame that.
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,rarity,No pony indeed.
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,spike,"So... [chuckles nervously] Ahem. Uh, who likes juggling?"
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,twilight sparkle,Princess Celestia! Please wait! Can we talk?
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,princess celestia,"I'm afraid I haven't much to say, Twilight."
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,twilight sparkle,"All right then. Just listen. You've guided me since I was a filly. You've given me knowledge and advice and friendship. Just once, I wanted to be able to give something back to you. I know what I did was wrong. I should've told you the truth. But I promised you could be in our play. I had to make it work. Nothing would make me feel worse than knowing I disappointed you."
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,princess celestia,You really mean that?
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,twilight sparkle,Of course! I look up to you more than any pony I've ever met! I hate to let you down. Like I did.
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,princess celestia,"[sighs] You had good intentions, Twilight. But you know that the truth is always better than a well-meant lie. Didn't Applejack remind you?"
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,twilight sparkle,"[sighs] About a hundred times. And now, because I didn't listen to her, I've ruined your whole ones-versary."
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,princess celestia,"Well... I don't know about that. Isn't there an old saying? ""The show must go on""? There may be a way for us to save the play yet."
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,twilight sparkle,"But how? I mean, if I'm being completely honest... you're not an actress."
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,princess celestia,No. But I am a princess.
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,spike,Ugh! Good news <U+0096> free food. [chewing] Bad news <U+0096> this play is officially a disaster.
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,princess celestia,"Fortunately, I know a thing or two about how to deal with those."
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,starlight glimmer,You came back!
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,princess celestia,"Yes. But let's celebrate later. Right now, we have a show to do!"
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,rarity,But... but... but how?! The audience is about to riot! We have no backdrop! And our lead actress is<U+0097>!
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,rarity,Uhhhh...
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,princess celestia,"No longer in that role. Rarity, Applejack, Pinkie, Twilight, go calm the audience. Let them know the play will start in just a minute."
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,princess celestia,"Rainbow Dash, bring us some clouds and place them behind the stage. There, that's our new backdrop. Starlight, do you have a copy of the script?"
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,princess celestia,"Spike, you narrate the play. Fluttershy will be our new lead."
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,princess celestia,Visualize with me. You're a princess. Regal. Commanding. Confident. Feel the rising sun's warmth. Equestria needs you.
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,spike,"Once upon a time, before Celestia, Equestria was suffering terrible hardship. Raising the sun every morning was so hard that it took five great sorcerers plus Star Swirl the Bearded to do it."
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,twilight sparkle,"Oh, no! Hecklers! What should we do?"
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,princess celestia,[whispering] Spike! Improvise!
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,spike,"Y-Yes. And, uh... raising the sun each day was super draining. But you can see that for yourselves, right? I mean, do these guys look beat-up or what? Star Swirl's so stressed, he's got kinks in his horn!"
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,spike,But that's okay. 'Cause it turns out Celestia had a special power to raise the sun all by herself!
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,fluttershy,It's time for a new day in Equestria!
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,twilight sparkle,"Ah! In all the commotion, we forgot we don't have a sun! What do we do?!"
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,princess celestia,We play charades.
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,princess celestia,"Judging by how many flowers the audience threw, it seems our play was a success."
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,fluttershy,I just feel bad you never got a chance to actually be in it.
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,princess celestia,"You shouldn't. I never felt I had to be on stage to be a part of the show. All I ever wanted was to share an honest bond of creativity, artistry, and happiness with my friends. And that's exactly what I got to do."
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,twilight sparkle,"Thank you for saving our play, Princess Celestia."
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,princess celestia,"You're welcome, Twilight. But from now on, none of you will have to call me ""Princess"" anymore."
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,spike,"Wait, what? We don't?"
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,princess celestia,"No. I had so much fun tonight, I've decided to give up my crown, step down from the throne, and devote all of my time to the theater!"
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,twilight sparkle,Y-You... what?!
Horse Play,Kaita Mpambara,princess celestia,Gotcha! Maybe I'm not such a bad actress after all.
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,sunburst,"What? Oh! Hi! [chuckles nervously] You know, no matter how many times I read it, Houyhnhnm's Guide to Magical Arcana never gets boring."
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,sunburst,Mm-hmm. Sure thing.
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,sunburst,What's this? Could I be experiencing the cerebration transmogrification effect described in chapter seventeen<U+0097>?
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,sunburst,Oh. My cutie mark is glowing. My cutie mark is glowing! I know what this means! Why am I yelling?!
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,sunburst,"Princess Twilight, what an honor this is! I-I mean, it is, right? I'm called for a friendship mission?"
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,twilight sparkle,You sure are. And it must be a special one. Nopony outside of Ponyville has ever been called before.
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,spike,"If you need some pointers, let me know. I've been on my fair share of missions."
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,twilight sparkle,"You've been on one, Spike."
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,spike,And that's my fair share.
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,sunburst,Starlight! You mean we've both been called? This is great!
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,starlight glimmer,[depressed] Yeah... Great...
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,sunburst,Aren't you excited? You and me on a mission together!
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,sunburst,I'm... sorry. Are you not excited to go on a mission with me?
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,starlight glimmer,"No. Uh, no! I mean, yes. Heh. Totally excited about us going together. Just... not so excited about where."
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,sunburst,Sire's Hollow?
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,starlight glimmer,Yep. Home.
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,sunburst,[deflated] Oh. Great.
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,spike,"You know, I can go if you two don't want to. I am kind of an expert."
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,starlight glimmer,"[sighs] It's not that I don't want to go home. It's just that whenever I do, my dad treats me like a filly. Like nothing's changed since I was a foal."
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,sunburst,Huh.
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,starlight glimmer,I know. I'm a horrible daughter.
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,sunburst,"N-No, no! My mom actually does kind of the same thing."
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,starlight glimmer,Really?
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,sunburst,"I don't even have to go home. She sends me letters constantly asking about my plans for the future. [imitating Stellar Flare] ""You're a grown-up pony, Sunburst! You need a plan!"" [sighs] I haven't been home in a while either."
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,starlight glimmer,Hmph. We'll just have to explain to our parents that we're on an important friendship mission so they can't bother us.
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,sunburst,Do you really think that will work?
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,starlight glimmer,Nope!
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,sunburst,"[sniffs, sighs] The great thing about home is it always stays just how you le<U+0097>"
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,sunburst,Augh!
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,starlight glimmer,Where did that come from?
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,sunburst,Essence of what?
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,starlight glimmer,What is it?
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,sunburst,Uh... chocolate maybe?
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,sunburst,Didn't this used to be a fruit stand?
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,sunburst,The Sire's Hollow Development what? Where do ponies buy fruit?
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,sunburst,All the shops are different. Everything's changed!
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,starlight glimmer,Not everything. That's the same as it ever was.
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,sunburst,What?!
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,starlight glimmer,Preservation Society? What is happening around here?
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,firelight,"I'll explain it to you, sugarplum! [chuckles] You are just as cutesy-wutesy as ever!"
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,starlight glimmer,[muffled] Dad! [normally] Quit it! What is going on?
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,starlight glimmer,"Dad, you promised no ""pumpky-wumpkin""'s in public!"
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,firelight,"[whispering] Sorry, chipmunk cheeks."
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,starlight glimmer,Don't. You're preserving the whole town? That's crazy!
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,stellar flare,"That's exactly what I told him! I said, ""Firelight, you're crazy!"""
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,sunburst,Mom?
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,stellar flare,"Our village needs the same thing you do, Sunburst <U+0096> a clear plan for the future."
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,stellar flare,That's why I started the Sire's Hollow Development Committee. And I've got plans for this little town. Big plans!
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,firelight,"Listen here, Stellar Flare! I'm not gonna let you turn our historical heritage into Las Pegasus!"
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,stellar flare,And I'm not gonna let you turn it into a museum!
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,starlight glimmer,W-Wait. Are you two fighting over this?
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,sunburst,Like having a friendship problem?
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,stellar flare,"Oh, there's no problem."
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,firelight,Because there is no friendship!
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,sunburst,"Well, the good news is we know why we're here."
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,sunburst,[sighs] Maybe we should've sent Spike after all.
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,starlight glimmer,"Sunburst and I were called here to do a job, and it looks like you two are it."
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,stellar flare,You mean your success depends on us?
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,sunburst,Uh...
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,firelight,And you have to hang out with us the whole time you're here?!
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,starlight glimmer,Um...
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,stellar flare,"Well, I'll hear what you have to say. But every plan I've made for this town is perfectly reasonable."
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,firelight,Good luck convincing me my preservation efforts don't make sense.
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,starlight glimmer,So we can't hold the books?
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,sunburst,Can you hold the books?
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,starlight glimmer,So nopony can read the books?
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,starlight glimmer,[sniffs] Fruity.
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,sunburst,Too bad there's nowhere to get actual fruit.
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,stellar flare,"In the future, all ponies will drink their fruit!"
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,stellar flare,"Okay, it's annoying. I get it."
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,firelight,Maybe my preservation efforts were a little over the top.
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,stellar flare,And I might have been trying to turn the town into a shopping mall.
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,firelight,"Well, whatever direction the town takes from now on, how about we work together on it?"
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,stellar flare,"Deal! Sunburst, you should move closer to Ponyville. After this success, I'm sure the Princess of Friendship will want to send you on more missions."
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,sunburst,"That's not really how it works. Oh, look at the time! We should get going now that we solved the friendship problem, right, Starlight?"
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,starlight glimmer,"Yeah... The thing is, I don't think we did solve it. When we solve a friendship problem, our cutie marks are supposed to glow."
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,firelight,"Aw, don't be disappointed, puddin'. Your papa will work this out for ya."
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,starlight glimmer,Heh. My papa wasn't called by the map in Twilight's castle. I was.
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,stellar flare,How are you gonna explain this to the princess? What's your plan if she fires you from friendship quests?
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,sunburst,Mom! She doesn't<U+0097>! It-It's not<U+0097>!
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,stellar flare,"Use your words, Sunburst."
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,starlight glimmer,I guess you two weren't the problem we were sent to solve after all.
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,stellar flare,So now you don't even know why you're here? Ah! We have to figure this out before we run out of time!
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,sunburst,"[sighs] Mom, there isn't a time limit."
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,firelight,"So you're here for an extra long visit? [laughs] You can stay in your old room, punkie wunk! It's just like you left it!"
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,starlight glimmer,[whispering] We need to find this friendship problem now!
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,firelight,"Now, I know you have your little job to do, but Stellar and I know the town a lot better than you two."
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,stellar flare,That's right! Neither of you have been home in ages. You're gonna need our help to succeed!
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,starlight glimmer,I guess that makes sense...
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,stellar flare,I already have some ideas!
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,firelight,"Me, too!"
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,sunburst,I think I liked it better when they were fighting.
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,firelight,"Okay! Now that I've explained how Sire's Hollow was founded, we can start to explore all the possible friendship problems that might have developed over time."
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,starlight glimmer,"[inhales] I appreciate the history lesson, Dad, but I need to find the problem now. In the present."
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,firelight,"Aw, now, hon-bun. How are you gonna do that without all the backstory, huh? Oh! Of course I know how hard it is for you to sit still and focus, soooo... would it help you pay attention to hold on to your bwankie?"
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,stellar flare,"Now, you've had a little setback. But don't worry. I know exactly what you need to do."
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,sunburst,Make a plan?
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,stellar flare,Already got one! Step one <U+0096> interview the suspects. Step two <U+0096> use your talents to solve the issue. Step three <U+0096> get the Princess of Friendship to send you on more missions!
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,sunburst,Mom! It does not work like that!
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,stellar flare,Uh-huh.
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,stellar flare,This is what happens when we don't rehearse! Ugh!
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,firelight,"Starlight? Sweetie? I found a really old town bylaw that nopony agrees on. Apparently, we're not supposed to prance or canter after dinnertime. Could that be the problem? Silly-filly?"
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,starlight glimmer,Whew! What are you doing?
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,sunburst,[sighs] Hiding from my mother. She started making up friendship problems for me to solve.
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,starlight glimmer,"[scoffs] My dad won't even let me talk to anypony in case they're ""strangers"". I'm a grown mare!"
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,sunburst,"[sighs] We're never going to find the friendship problem with them around, let alone solve it."
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,starlight glimmer,"[whispering] Okay! So we wanted to talk to all of you, you know, in private."
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,sunburst,[whispering] Just to see if there were issues any of you had with your friends.
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,sunburst,No. Not avoiding. Just... taking a break.
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,starlight glimmer,Yeah. We needed to focus. B-But we're definitely not avoiding them.
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,starlight glimmer,Mm-hmm.
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,sunburst,"Uh, but they definitely can't hear us in here, right?"
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,firelight,There you are! But what are you doing in here? [gasps] Is the friendship problem in my favorite section of the bookstore?
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,firelight,"...And then, I thought the best way to look for a friendship problem in the present..."
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,starlight glimmer,Dad!
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,firelight,...was to look back in our town history even farther!
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,stellar flare,"Sunburst! Oh, finally! Now, I know you don't want me to make up a problem, but what if I start one?"
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,sunburst,That's not how this<U+0097>!
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,stellar flare,"I mean, nopony ever became a success by following all the rules, right?"
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,stellar flare,[to Firelight] How are things on your end?
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,firelight,Couldn't be better! New leads and such!
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,starlight glimmer,Guys...?
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,stellar flare,"We really are providing excellent assistance, aren't we?"
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,sunburst,Guys!
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,firelight,I dare say our children should be grateful for our help.
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,starlight glimmer,Guys!
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,stellar flare,I'm sorry. You don't want our help?
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,firelight,[chuckles] That's... That's ridiculous! What reason could you possibly have for that?
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,starlight glimmer,Because you're driving us crazy!
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,stellar flare,"Oh, really? And just how am I driving you crazy?"
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,sunburst,"By always coming up with plans! I don't need a plan! I mean, maybe I do, but it'll be mine, not yours!"
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,starlight glimmer,"And you're not any better! I'm not a filly! I'm a grown pony with a job to do, and I'll do it on my own!"
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,firelight,Well. I'll let you get to it then.
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,starlight glimmer,Great. Now we have to smooth things over with our parents on top of finding and solving a friendship problem.
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,sunburst,It's almost like our relationship with our parents is the friendship problem.
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,starlight glimmer,"You don't think that's it, do you?"
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,starlight glimmer,"[groans, collapses] Why couldn't we have been sent to stop a war or something?!"
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,starlight glimmer,Dad?
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,firelight,"Hello, Ms. Glimmer. How is your friendship problem search going? I only ask as an interested observer, since I know you are an adult who's capable of doing things without help from anypony else."
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,starlight glimmer,Actually... I think Sunburst and I figured out what it is.
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,firelight,So Stellar and I weren't really helpful after all.
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,starlight glimmer,"Well, we haven't actually solved it. And I don't think we can. Not without you."
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,stellar flare,[coughing] Pungent. Ugh. [to Sunburst] Oh. Did you come by to be driven crazy by more of your mother's plans?
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,sunburst,"No, I came to apologize."
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,stellar flare,"Well, it's going to take more than an apology to make up for telling me you don't want my help finding your friendship problem."
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,sunburst,"Oh, I'm not sorry for that. Starlight and I already figured out what the problem is."
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,stellar flare,This is a terrible apology.
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,sunburst,"Well, if you come with me and help fix it, I'll give you a better one."
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,starlight glimmer,"Usually, Twilight or one of our other friends gets called to a place with a friendship problem to fix."
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,sunburst,But Starlight and I realized we came here to fix a friendship problem we already had.
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,starlight glimmer,"I'm sorry I've been avoiding coming home, Dad. But you can't keep treating me like a foal."
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,firelight,"I'm sorry, sugarbun. [sighs] I just know how hard things were for you when you left home. I guess I wanted you to feel safe, like... when you were young."
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,starlight glimmer,"Dad, I know I've made some mistakes, and I'll probably make a bunch more. But I learn from them. I think that's what growing up is."
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,sunburst,"I'm sorry I never told you how much your plans bothered me, and I know you just want me to succeed. But I need to do that on my own."
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,stellar flare,"I remember how lost you were when you flunked out of magic school. I thought as long as you had a plan, you'd never feel that way again."
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,sunburst,"You don't have to worry, Mom. I need to find my own way. And I definitely don't feel lost anymore."
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,stellar flare,The glowing cutie mark is such a symbol of accomplishment. I don't suppose there's a way for you to get it to glow all the time.
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,sunburst,[chuckles] Pretty sure it doesn't work that way.
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,starlight glimmer,"Not unless we solved a friendship problem every few seconds, and I kinda hope this one will be it for a while."
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,firelight,"You know, it seems to me your map is saying we're not just your parents. Heh. We're your friends, too."
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,starlight glimmer,I guess so.
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,firelight,"So if I promise to treat you less like a little filly and more like a friend, will you visit more?"
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,starlight glimmer,Absolutely. Mmm.
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,sunburst,"And if you start to drive me crazy again, I'll tell you instead of never coming home."
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,stellar flare,"That's lovely of you to say, dear. But you know, I can always visit you."
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,firelight,"Stellar, you're a genius! [laughs] How do you feel about a road trip?"
The Parent Map,Dave Rapp,stellar flare,I might have a few plans for that.
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,yona,Huh?
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,silverstream,Whoa!
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,rainbow dash,Did I miss the Teacher of the Month announcement?
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,applejack,You're just in time. But it's gonna be me.
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,rainbow dash,"Yeah, right. I got this one nailed."
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,twilight sparkle,And the Friendship School Teacher of the Month is... Fluttershy!
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,applejack,[groans] Again?
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,rainbow dash,Come on!
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,fluttershy,"Oh, my! I don't know how I keep winning."
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,rainbow dash,"Yeah. Me, neither."
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,twilight sparkle,The award is based on the students' vote. They must really like you.
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,twilight sparkle,"Congratulations, Fluttershy!"
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,twilight sparkle,Next item of business <U+0096> I've been looking into a new activity for our friendship classes. Spike?
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,twilight sparkle,"Section one-forty-seven, paragraph two states that teamwork is a key part of friendship. And section two-two-nine, paragraph nine says outdoor activity reinforces learning. Add that together, and what do you get?"
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,pinkie pie,"Ooh, ooh! Okay, let me see. One-forty-seven, two-twenty-nine, carry the two... Three hundred and eighty-seven?"
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,twilight sparkle,"Mm-mm. A teamwork field trip. Leading it is a Teacher of the Month-type job, so I thought I'd ask<U+0097>"
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,applejack,"I'm your pony, Twilight! Sweet Apple Acres has taught me a thing or two about workin' together."
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,rainbow dash,"Yeah, but being a Wonderbolt's the definition of teamwork."
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,applejack,[chuckles] I'm sure you're not sayin' fancy flyin' makes ya a better choice than me.
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,rainbow dash,"[chuckles] I wouldn't say ""better"". Just a little more qualified. No offense."
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,fluttershy,Maybe you can lead the field trip together.
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,twilight sparkle,Of course! Who better to model the importance of working as a team?
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,pinkie pie,"Um, Rarity? Fluttershy? Me? Spike? This flowerpot?"
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,twilight sparkle,"Both of you are teamwork experts. If the students see the two of you teaching together, they'll learn even more. I know you've been competitive in the past, but I'm sure you'd never let that get in the way of friendship education."
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,applejack,Of course!
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,rainbow dash,Totally!
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,ocellus,I've never been on a field trip before.
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,smolder,"Yeah, what's the point of this exactly?"
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,gallus,Getting out of the classroom. Duh.
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,sandbar,[chuckles] Pretty sure the headmare has something else in mind.
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,twilight sparkle,"All right, class. Today you'll learn how important working together is for building a strong friendship."
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,applejack,"Hey, y'all! Ready to get out there and do some learnin' the Apple family way?"
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,rainbow dash,"This is basically gonna be the best field trip in the history of ever! With me in charge, that is. Whoa!"
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,applejack,[chuckles nervously] With us in charge. Meanin' mostly me.
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,rainbow dash,Yeah. Good one.
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,twilight sparkle,And what teamwork activity do you two have planned for today?
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,silverstream,No... way. We get to do both?!
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,twilight sparkle,I bet that's exactly what your teachers had in mind. Why don't you start with shed building first?
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,applejack,"Heh. Don't mind if I do! Everycreature, follow the leader!"
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,twilight sparkle,I'll check in later to see how it's going. Remember to work together!
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,applejack,"[deep inhale] Now take a good, deep breath. What do you smell?"
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,gallus,"[inhale] Uh, yak?"
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,yona,[sniffing] Mm-hmm!
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,applejack,Nope. Try again.
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,ocellus,"Um, apples?"
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,applejack,And...? Anyone? Anyone? No? The promise of... teamwork! That there's an apple shed. And this here is what we're gonna use to build it. Nothin' brings friends together like a little hard work and honest sweat.
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,rainbow dash,[laughing] Sweat? Seriously? That's supposed to be part of friendship?
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,applejack,"Not everypony would know that, Rainbow Dash. Just ""Teacher of the Month"" kind o' ponies."
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,rainbow dash,Whatever. Let's just get this done so we can move on to my activity.
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,applejack,That's it! Measure twice and cut once! Haste makes waste! Slow and steady!
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,rainbow dash,Emphasis on the slow.
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,applejack,Rainbow Dash! Ya can't build an apple shed like that!
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,rainbow dash,"[scoffs] Oh, yeah? I just did!"
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,sandbar,Whoa! No way!
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,gallus,Impressive... if you can call an apple shed impressive.
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,applejack,Just 'cause it's fast don't mean it's good!
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,applejack,"Don't count your pictures before they're snapped, Rainbow Dash."
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,rainbow dash,"Oh, come on! These students are totally gonna vote for a teacher who gets things done!"
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,applejack,No! They're gonna vote for a teacher who gets things done right!
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,smolder,Yeah... This isn't awkward at all...
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,applejack,Steady... Steady... Take 'er nice and slow...
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,applejack,Little to the left...
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,applejack,"Uh, a hair to the right..."
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,applejack,"Now, a hoof shavin' higher..."
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,rainbow dash,[growls] Just bring it down already!
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,applejack,I'll give ya one guess whose side is still standin'.
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,yona,[chuckles nervously] Uh...
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,ocellus,"Um, professors? I'm a little confused about teamwork now."
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,rainbow dash,That's because you need a different teacher. Follow me! Last one to the stream is a rotten apple shed!
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,rainbow dash,Who's ready to smash the all-time Equestria speed record for river canoeing?!
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,gallus,Is that even a thing?
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,sandbar,First I've heard of it.
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,rainbow dash,We need to get to the finish line before this alarm goes off. That means you gotta move fast! Any questions?
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,yona,"Uh, Yona has questions."
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,rainbow dash,No time for 'em! Get in the boat!
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,applejack,You really think winnin' some canoein' record is gonna get you that Teacher of the Month trophy?
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,rainbow dash,I'm pretty sure everycreature's gonna like it a lot better than pounding nails and cutting wood.
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,yona,Yak not like water.
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,ocellus,"Sometimes, when I'm scared to try something new, I whistle."
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,gallus,"We got you, Yona."
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,applejack,"Way I see it, Twilight's gonna give that teachin' trophy to a teacher, not a racer."
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,rainbow dash,We'll see about that.
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,rainbow dash,"Stroke! Stroke! Stroke! Harder! Put your backs into it, newbies!"
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,applejack,"Stroooooke... Stroooooke... Stroooooke... Slower... Focus on your paddle technique, y'all."
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,silverstream,Woo-hoo! We're really going now!
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,smolder,So... when do we get to the part when we move?
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,rainbow dash,"When everycreature starts listening to me, the leader of my activity, Applejack! Now stroke!"
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,rainbow dash,"Dig in, team! We can still beat that record!"
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,applejack,Stop!
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,rainbow dash,Go!
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,ocellus,Which way do we go?
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,rainbow dash,Left!
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,applejack,Right!
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,silverstream,"Aye-aye, captains! Wait, what?"
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,rainbow dash,Left! I can see the finish line from here!
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,applejack,"If we go left, we'll be headin' straight into the bite-acuda fish!"
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,rainbow dash,Who cares about a few fish?
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,sandbar,"Uh, professors?"
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,applejack,You'll care plenty when they bite ya!
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,sandbar,Guys?
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,rainbow dash,We'll just go around them!
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,sandbar,Rock!
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,silverstream,I love field trips!
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,applejack,I hope you're happy.
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,rainbow dash,[scoffs] Obviously not! Because there goes our new speed record!
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,yona,"[panicked whistling, coughing] Help! Yak not swim!"
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,ocellus,That's okay! Your friends can change into creatures that do!
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,twilight sparkle,How's the canoeing... going?
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,smolder,About as good as the apple shed building.
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,rainbow dash,I totally had things under control until Applejack messed 'em up!
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,applejack,I did not!
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,rainbow dash,Did too!
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,applejack,Did not!
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,gallus,Yup. It's been like this all day.
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,sandbar,I wouldn't say all day. Just... ninety-nine percent of it.
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,twilight sparkle,I can't believe this! You're not teaching teamwork! You're competing with each other! I thought you were past that!
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,rainbow dash,We are! Mostly.
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,applejack,We got carried away with wantin' to be the Teacher of the Month is all.
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,twilight sparkle,The Teacher of the Month wouldn't care about being the Teacher of the Month! I know Fluttershy would be thrilled to see another pony win. That's it! I'm taking over this field trip!
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,applejack,"H-Hold up, Twilight. Don't count Rainbow Dash for the award just yet. You shoulda seen her fire up those students to build a shed."
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,rainbow dash,"No way! You're the one the students listen to. Besides, you saved us from those pony-eating fish."
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,rainbow dash,"Uh, long story. But Applejack should definitely be Teacher of the Month."
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,twilight sparkle,"Hmmm... Maybe you two have learned something, after all."
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,rainbow dash,Field trip?
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,twilight sparkle,Well...
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,rainbow dash,"Come on, Twilight. We get it. No more arguing. Right, Applejack?"
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,applejack,Right as rain and twice as fresh!
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,twilight sparkle,Fine. But I'm picking the next activity you two lead. A nature walk. Nopony could possibly argue over that. Right?
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,applejack,See? We're agreein' already.
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,applejack,"Well, look at that. The path splits up ahead. Left or right?"
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,smolder,Ugh. Here we go again.
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,applejack,"Where to, Rainbow Dash?"
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,rainbow dash,I was thinking right... unless you want to go left. Because what makes you happy makes me happy.
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,applejack,"Aw, heck. Forget about me. You want to go right, we'll go right."
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,rainbow dash,"But teamwork means listening to other ponies, so it's up to you."
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,applejack,"Well, aren't you as sweet as sugar apple pie? But it's up to you."
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,yona,Ugh! Follow me! Yak know best way!
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,applejack,Hey! Where are y'all goin'?
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,ocellus,I think we've gone in the same circle five times.
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,sandbar,Only because someponies won't make up their minds about which way to go.
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,rainbow dash,"Do you want to keep going in a circle, Applejack?"
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,applejack,"Up to you, Rainbow Dash. I insist."
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,rainbow dash,"[chuckles] No, no. I insist."
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,applejack,Heh. But I insisted first.
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,silverstream,Are we still on a field trip? 'Cause this just feels like being lost.
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,smolder,Ugh.
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,smolder,We can still get back to school before dark if we cross that ravine and stop doubling back.
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,rainbow dash,"We knew that. All part of our plan. Right, Applejack?"
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,applejack,"Uh, yup! All we have to do is, uh... build a bridge 'cross that, uh, giant canyon, and we're home free. That is, if-if you think a bridge is a good idea."
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,rainbow dash,Only if you want to build a bridge.
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,gallus,Stop! Listen. We can just fly everyone over and be done.
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,applejack,Nope! There's still plenty o' time to teach y'all a lesson in teamwork.
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,rainbow dash,Cooperation!
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,applejack,Togetherness!
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,rainbow dash,You are so right!
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,applejack,Only as right as you are!
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,smolder,Okay! We'll build a bridge! What do we use?
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,applejack,I'm goin' with your idea! Vines! No buts about it!
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,rainbow dash,I-I'm building with your idea! Branches! End of story!
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,applejack,[muffled] Why use a branch when you can use a vine? [grunting] Whoa!
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,rainbow dash,Why didn't I think of branches to begin with? They're so<U+0097> [yelping] ...easy to work with.
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,applejack,"[muffled] Come on now... [grunting] These here vines are just the thing, Rainbow Dash!"
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,ocellus,"Uh, at least now they're agreeing on something."
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,rainbow dash,[grunting] I can't get out!
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,rainbow dash,Let me guess. Bite-acudas?
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,applejack,Mm-hmm.
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,applejack,And they look mighty hungry.
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,sandbar,We gotta get our professors out of there! Anycreature have a plan?
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,gallus,Leave 'em hangin'?
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,silverstream,What?!
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,gallus,I'm kidding! ...Kinda.
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,ocellus,We need to work fast! And together!
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,smolder,But mainly fast.
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,applejack,"I hate to admit it, but<U+0097>"
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,applejack,...this whole mess is kinda our fault.
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,rainbow dash,Yeah. No trophy is worth getting eaten over.
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,applejack,So what do ya say? You want to team up and get ourselves out of this here pickle barrel?
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,rainbow dash,I thought you'd never ask.
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,ocellus,Aah! Don't worry. I'm just the distraction.
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,rainbow dash,Ocellus?!
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,applejack,[sighs] You nearly scared the cutie marks off us!
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,silverstream,Need a lift?
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,sandbar,"Welcome back, professors!"
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,rainbow dash,"Now, that was a rescue!"
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,applejack,And y'all did it together!
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,gallus,No big. Those fish weren't even a thing.
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,ocellus,[chuckles] Oops. Sorry.
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,silverstream,[giggles] Best... field trip... ever!
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,twilight sparkle,Huh? How was the field trip? What did you all learn?
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,yona,Yak learn ponies smart!
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,silverstream,Yeah! Professors Applejack and Rainbow Dash were such good teachers!
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,gallus,It was kind of crazy genius. They showed us what not to do so we'd figure out what we should do.
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,twilight sparkle,Really...?
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,sandbar,It took us a while to get it.
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,smolder,Especially at the ravine. It would've been so much easier to just fly home.
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,silverstream,"But instead, our professors built bridges the wrong way just to show us how important teamwork is."
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,gallus,Yeah. That was super dangerous. Talk about commitment.
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,ocellus,We know it's too early to pick the Teacher of the Month. But we'd like you to consider Rainbow Dash and Applejack.
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,twilight sparkle,Thank you for telling me. I'm so glad to hear your field trip was a success. I'll make sure to schedule another one right away.
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,twilight sparkle,"[to Rainbow Dash and Applejack] You were actually just competing the entire time, weren't you?"
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,applejack,To tell you the truth... yeah.
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,rainbow dash,"Well, not all the time. I agreed with you for the whole nature walk."
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,applejack,Only 'cause you were anglin' for that Teacher of the Month award!
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,rainbow dash,"You were the one doing the ""angling""!"
Non-Compete Clause,Kim Beyer-Johnson,applejack,[scoffs] You were more like fandanglin'!
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,spike,"You said it, Big Mac. This is taking forever! I know it's wrong to cut corners when it comes to gifts from the heart, but this is an emergency, right?"
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,big mcintosh,Eeyup.
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,spike,Discord? A little help? Discord!
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,spike,Yeah? Oh! Good idea! [clears throat] Captain Wuzz! Are you prepared to enter the world of Ogres & Oubliettes?
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,discord,"Huzzah, fellow adventurers! Shall we storm the ramparts of Squizard's castle to reclaim Calico's Ring of Imperceptibility?"
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,discord,"You did summon me for a rousing Guys' Night of Ogres & Oubliettes, did you not?"
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,spike,"Uh, sort of. But do you think you could magically hurry up this pie real quick first?"
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,discord,You seem to be mixing up [poof!] the Lord of Chaos [poof!] with a second-rate clown magician for hire.
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,big mcintosh,Eee... wait!
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,spike,"This needs to go in the mail today, or it'll never get to Sugar Belle in time for Hearts and Hooves Day!"
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,discord,Please. Can't you see that that holiday is a commercialized ruse pushed on you by the greeting card industry?
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,discord,Keep your eye on the pie. [<e0> la Doug Henning] It's magic time!
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,discord,[sniffing] This smells... uh... palatable.
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,spike,"Well, pies really are Sugar Belle's thing. But I think that makes this all the more special. It shows you're interested in what she cares about."
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,big mcintosh,Eeyup!
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,spike,And he's planning a big romantic Hearts and Hooves dinner. It was my idea to bake the invitation inside.
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,discord,"[reading] ""Happy Hearts and Hooves Day, Sugar Belle. Meet me in my barn at sunset for a surprise."""
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,spike,"Pretty clever, huh?"
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,spike,"Awww. ""Sugar Belle"". See?"
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,discord,"Well, you two certainly have bought into this romance nonsense hook, line, and sinker."
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,spike,"For a formerly friendless immortal despot, you're pretty cynical."
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,discord,"I'm a realist. And love, like all things warm and fuzzy, isn't real."
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,spike,"Aw, come on. You act tough, but deep down, you're a softie. I mean, you don't have tea with Fluttershy every weekend because you like tea."
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,discord,"But I do like tea! Every tea! All the teas! Chamomile, Earl Grey, green, white, yellow, mate, lemon, ginger, chai, spearmint, peppermint, hibiscus... [inhale] ...cinnamon, pumpkin spice."
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,spike,"Tell you what. While Big Mac mails his incredibly romantic gesture, I'll show you the splendors of Hearts and Hooves Day in Ponyville. I bet I can prove you believe in love."
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,discord,Fine. Call it a gentleman's wager. Loser mows my lawn for eternity.
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,spike,"Is it, like, a riding mower or...?"
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,discord,Tweezers!
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,apple bloom,"Hear ye, hear ye! This special Hearts and Hooves Day meetin' of the Cutie Mark Crusaders is now in session! First order of business <U+0096> helpin' my big brother decorate the barn for his big date with Sugar Belle tonight, and... Hello?"
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,sweetie belle,It seems like everypony's got somepony special but us.
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,scootaloo,When's it gonna be our turn?
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,apple bloom,Huh?
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,scootaloo,[gasps] Who's it from?
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,apple bloom,"Can't tell. It's all smudged, but it looks like it's addressed to... ""Belle""? Hmmm..."
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,sweetie belle,"[gasps] ""Sweetie Belle""!"
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,sweetie belle,Somepony certainly went through a lot of trouble for me! On Hearts and Hooves Day!
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,scootaloo,[gasps] You don't think...
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,sweetie belle,Could it be...?
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,apple bloom,"Hang on a minute. Mysterious package, smudged address, no idea who it's from... Hm. I know what this is. You've got a secret admirer!"
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,spike,"[sighs] Another Hearts and Hooves Day. Love is in the air, Discord. Look at all these happy couples."
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,discord,How can they be happy if they aren't playing Ogres & Oubliettes?
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,spike,"As a great dragon poet once wrote to his beloved, ""I love you with the utmost clarity. I love you, dear. My sweet, sweet Rarity<U+0097>"" Are you even listening?!"
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,discord,"Of course. ""Love is... something-something, and Discord is great."" I don't know. Can we play O&O now?"
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,spike,"Sure, after you admit you believe in love and... Sugar Belle!"
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,spike,Big Mac's girlfriend. What's she doing in town so early?
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,mrs. cake,"Mrs. Well, Sugar Belle, I'm sure Big Mac won't be expecting it."
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,spike,[gasps] She's planning her own romantic surprise for Big Mac? What if she goes to Sweet Apple Acres before Big Mac's ready with his surprise? We've gotta warn him!
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,big mcintosh,"[singing] ...ffle, cookin' a souffle..."
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,spike,Aah!
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,big mcintosh,Whoa!
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,spike,"[slurring] Mig Bac... Mig Bac...! [groans] I mean, Big Mac! We just saw Sugar Belle! She's at Sugarcube Corner! But I think she's on her way over here now! You gotta keep her away from here until the barn's finished!"
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,big mcintosh,[gasps] Eeyup!
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,spike,I wonder what she has planned for him.
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,spike,Aah!
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,spike,Ugh! Will you warn me next time you do that?
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,spike,"Ohhhh. She hasn't seen him yet. Take note, Discord. This is what love is all about."
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,discord,"""Spike <U+0096> Love is about spying in the bushes."""
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,spike,Make fun of me all you want. But look at Big Mac's face and tell me you don't believe in love.
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,sugar belle,I hope he'll be okay without me.
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,spike,Oh. Hey. We're just... not spying<U+0097>
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,big mcintosh,Hush!
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,sugar belle,"I mean, he has been on his own before. So he'll be fine, right? [sighs] How should I tell Big Mac tonight? ""You won't need to come visit me in my village anymore""? ""We need to talk."""
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,mrs. cake,Mrs. Just be honest with him.
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,sugar belle,"You're right. Okay! ""We're finished."""
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,discord,You're right. She did surprise him.
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,spike,Ugh.
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,spike,"Okay. Things seem bad. Maybe they're really not. Maybe ""we're finished"" was about the day. Ponies say that, right? Like-like, ""Hey, remember yesterday? That's finished, 'cause it's today!"""
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,spike,"Maybe not that. Oh, I know! Maybe Sugar Belle has a wacky cousin who's never been on his own, and she has to leave him in charge of her shop while she apprentices with Mrs. Cake, who does that, like, two days a week. N-No, no, three. That's why she won't need you to come to her village anymore, because... she'll already be here!"
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,spike,Nah. I don't even buy that one.
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,discord,"Oh, I hate seeing you like this, Big Mac. And over a girl, no less. I'm calling an emergency Guys' Night [poof!] right now to cheer you up."
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,discord,Class is now in session.
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,discord,Lesson one <U+0096> nothing can break your heart if you only love yourself. You've got to show everypony that you're too cool to be bothered with so-called love. Observe.
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,discord,"This is how cool guys lean against things. When you see a guy leaning against a thing looking this cool, you think, ""Wow! That guy doesn't have a care in Equestria. Not a guy who leans on things that cool."""
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,spike,I don't think leaning's gonna help. Am I doing it right? Whoa!
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,spike,"We're not like you, Discord. We can't put on a front and pretend not to love. It's impossible."
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,discord,"Lesson two <U+0096> plenty of ponies in the pasture. Right, Big Mac? I know just the gal to make you forget all about Sugar Belle."
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,big mcintosh,You... said... her... [wailing] naaaaaaame!
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,apple bloom,"Okay. We finished decoratin' the barn for Big Mac, which means we got the rest of the day to ourselves. There's a whole town of possible admirers out there and only three of us. But together, we're gonna get to the bottom of this! Ready? Break! Excuse me! Pipsqueak? Mind answerin' a few questions? No? Late for somethin'? Are you Sweetie Belle's secret admirer?!"
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,scootaloo,[to Button Mash] Excuse me! I'm doing a research survey about sending pie in the mail anonymously. Would you say you're pro-that or anti-that?
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,sweetie belle,"[to Snips and Snails] Happy Hearts and Hooves Day! Did you boys happen to send any packages to me recently? It's okay to say no! I won't be offended! [whispering] Please say no, please say no, please say no."
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,spike,Wow. You're really going all out to cheer up Big Mac. I'm impressed.
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,discord,"Yes, yes, I'm amazing. Anyway, since we're in the neighborhood, care for a quick game of Ogres & Oubliettes? Like I've been wanting to play all week?!"
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,spike,I take it back.
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,discord,I'm helping our friend first and foremost. See for yourself.
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,spike,I think he's showing her a picture of Sugar Belle.
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,discord,What?
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,spike,And now he's crying.
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,discord,"No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no. No, he's not. Let me see that."
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,spike,Don't touch it! I'm looking!
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,discord,Give me that!
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,spike,"Cut it out! Discord, quit it!"
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,big mcintosh,"She used to do this thing where her-her nose would wrinkle when she laughed. Right there, in that hole where your nose used to be. I never told her how much I loved wrinkle-nose cutie-face... [wailing] and now I never will!"
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,spike,"Okay. I think we've had enough of the aloof master of chaos remedies for a broken heart. You know what I do when I have a problem too big to solve? I hide from it! When she can't find you, she'll realize how much she misses you. Plus, if she can't find you, she can't break up with you."
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,big mcintosh,Eeyup. Hup!
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,spike,Ha!
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,scootaloo,[sighs] I don't get it. We asked every stallion in Ponyville.
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,apple bloom,[groans] There's gotta be somepony we're missin'. Somepony obvious. Somepony right in front of our noses.
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,sweetie belle,"Oh, well. At least the barn's looking great for Big Mac's date."
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,discord,Too bad there won't be a date.
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,sweetie belle,Sugar Belle is so lucky to have a non-secret admirer like Big Mac.
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,discord,"Well, she certainly doesn't seem to have appreciated it."
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,apple bloom,"I bet she's gonna take one look at this barn and say, ""What did I ever do to deserve this?"""
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,discord,"[whispering] Yes, what did she do to deserve this?"
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,big mcintosh,She broke my heart.
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,discord,"Well, not yet, technically. In fact, she can't break your heart if you break hers first."
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,big mcintosh,[angrily] Eeyup!
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,sugar belle,"Thanks for the tour of Ponyville, Mrs. Cake."
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,mrs. cake,"Mrs. Oh, my pleasure."
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,sugar belle,"I'm off to surprise Big Mac with the news. Imagine the look on his face when I tell him, ""We need to talk."""
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,mrs. cake,"Mrs. Oh, dear me, no! I told you, don't say it that way or he'll think you're breaking up with him."
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,sugar belle,"Break up with him? Never! Why, without my favorite delivery pony, I couldn't imagine being happy ever again. He knows that."
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,sugar belle,"He's a good listener, that pony. I promise you, no mix-ups."
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,sugar belle,Ah! Big Mac!
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,big mcintosh,Sugar Belle... we need to talk.
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,big mcintosh,I know why you're here.
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,sugar belle,You do?
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,big mcintosh,But I have somethin' to tell you first.
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,sugar belle,"Oh, can I go first? I'm gonna be<U+0097>"
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,big mcintosh,Stop.
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,sugar belle,Oh. Why don't we tell each other on three? One<U+0097>
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,big mcintosh,It's over!
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,sugar belle,What's over?
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,big mcintosh,You and me. It's over.
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,sugar belle,Ah... What?
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,big mcintosh,We're breakin' up!
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,sugar belle,I... don't understand. Why are you breaking up with me? And why are you leaning like that?
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,big mcintosh,I... don't know!
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,sugar belle,"Big Mac, please. Talk to me."
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,big mcintosh,"I... You... [loud groan] This is why I don't like talkin'! Words can hurt! Words hurt! Goodbye, Sugar Belle!"
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,apple bloom,"Big Mac! Oh, thank goodness! You gotta help us with this."
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,spike,"Ugh. Dude, how long have you been not hiding?"
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,discord,Oh. I should probably have said something.
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,big mcintosh,Y'all should go.
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,spike,Did ya...? Did she...? Are ya...?
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,apple bloom,"Big Mac, what's goin' on? Where's Sugar Belle?"
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,big mcintosh,Just go!
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,sweetie belle,But we worked so hard on this chart. I think we've almost cracked it. If you could just<U+0097>
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,big mcintosh,Not right now!
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,sweetie belle,But I can't stand having a secret admirer who's too scared to tell me who he is!
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,big mcintosh,Maybe he doesn't like talkin'!
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,sweetie belle,But that doesn't make any sense!
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,big mcintosh,"Maybe he used to talk too much, and it only ever got him into trouble!"
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,spike,"[sighs] What if you're right, Discord? What if love isn't real at all?"
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,big mcintosh,"I'm sorry, Sweetie Belle. I'm just mad, and I'm takin' it out on you."
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,sweetie belle,That's okay. I bet it felt good to get it out though.
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,big mcintosh,"Actually, it did. Tellin' you how I felt just then... I gotta go!"
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,spike,Big Mac! Where are ya goin'?
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,big mcintosh,I gotta talk to Sugar Belle!
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,spike,"Discord, you gotta use your magic and...! Guess you have better things to do. Big Mac's gonna need a miracle."
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,sugar belle,Oh. All the rotten luck...
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,big mcintosh,"Caught ya just in time! We both know I don't like to say much, but I'm gonna say somethin' now. [sighs] Even though I'm hurtin', I wouldn't trade this feelin' for anythin'. Because it'd mean givin' up the good times we had, too. I only broke up with you because you were gonna break up with me. I respect your decision, and you should know you'll always be in my heart."
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,sugar belle,I didn't want to break up with you.
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,big mcintosh,"But... you said you didn't need me to visit anymore. You said I'm gonna be on my own. I-I heard you said ""we're finished"" when I was hidin' in the bushes."
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,big mcintosh,That sounds worse than it is.
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,sugar belle,"Oh, Big Mac! I was talking about my cousin! I have this wacky cousin who's never been on his own, but I have to let him run my shop on weekends. Which is why you won't be delivering to my village anymore because I'll already be here apprenticing with Mrs. Cake, who does that two days a week. No, three."
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,big mcintosh,Wait 'til I tell Spike!
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,sugar belle,"I'd never break up with you! I suppose there's a lesson here somewhere about communication, talking instead of assuming, or eavesdropping is wrong. Wouldn't you say?"
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,big mcintosh,Eeeeyup!
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,big mcintosh,Hee-hee. Wrinkle-nose cutie-face. [kisses] You must've been awful confused at my breakin' up with you after you got my pie.
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,sugar belle,What pie?
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,big mcintosh,You didn't get the pie I sent?
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,sugar belle,Mm-mm.
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,big mcintosh,Or the invitation?
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,sugar belle,Uh-uh.
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,big mcintosh,"Well, in that case... allow me to escort you to a Hearts and Hooves Day surprise!"
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,apple bloom,Mind if we join ya?
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,sweetie belle,"[chomp] [reading] ""Happy Hearts and Hooves Day, Sugar Belle. Meet me<U+0097>"""
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,cutie mark crusaders,Sugar Belle?!
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,scootaloo,You have got to be pulling our hooves!
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,sweetie belle,It was all a mix-up?!
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,sweetie belle,"Oh, it's funny. I've been sitting here feeling sorry for myself for not having a special pony on Hearts and Hooves Day. But remembering all the fun we had, I think I have two special ponies <U+0096> my two best friends."
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,spike,[sighs] And so ends another Hearts and Hooves Day. Despite a bumpy start... and middle... and ending... lot of bumps today... love was in the air.
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,discord,"So was confusion, apparently, and a fair number of assumptions."
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,spike,"But you have to admit, after seeing everything Big Mac went through, love is a hundred percent real."
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,spike,"Seriously?! Discord, come on! I can't believe you!"
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,discord,Who do you think broke Sugar Belle's wagon wheel?
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,discord,Ta-da! Happy Hearts and Hooves Day!
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,spike,You old softie. [laughs] I knew you had a heart.
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,discord,"Calico's Ring of Imperceptibility isn't going to reclaim itself, you know."
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,spike,"Ogres & Oubliettes? I thought you'd never ask! Oh, and... just wondering. No biggie, but... is Skellinore gonna be there?"
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,discord,"Spike, she's an imaginary one-dimensional paper cutout skeleton."
The Break Up Break Down,Nick Confalone,spike,"Well, nopony's perfect."
Molt Down,Josh Haber,rarity,"I do appreciate you showing me the way to the phoenix nests, Spike."
Molt Down,Josh Haber,spike,"Anything for you, Rarity. Besides, I've been meaning to visit Peewee."
Molt Down,Josh Haber,rarity,He really was an excellent pet. I can't imagine why you set him free.
Molt Down,Josh Haber,spike,"Phoenixes aren't meant to be domesticated. Even in the wild, they like to keep to themselves."
Molt Down,Josh Haber,rarity,"Well, they are beautiful. A few of their feathers will add just the right splash of color to my latest<U+0097> Spike! What are you doing?"
Molt Down,Josh Haber,spike,"Uh, nothing!"
Molt Down,Josh Haber,rarity,Is there something wrong with your face?
Molt Down,Josh Haber,spike,[sighs] It's a stone scale. It isn't magical or anything like the call of the Dragon Lord. It's just... red. And itchy. [groans] And embarrassing.
Molt Down,Josh Haber,rarity,"Ooh, precious pants, that does look uncomfortable. But even I get the odd blemish from time to time. It's nothing to be embarrassed by. You could pay Zecora a visit. She makes a cream that works wonders. Just don't get the shampoo."
Molt Down,Josh Haber,spike,There's Peewee's parents! But I don't see Peewee.
Molt Down,Josh Haber,rarity,"Oh, maybe he moved out. Everypony has to leave the nest at some point."
Molt Down,Josh Haber,spike,Peewee!
Molt Down,Josh Haber,rarity,Perhaps you should pay Zecora a visit sooner rather than later.
Molt Down,Josh Haber,spike,"[sighs] I don't want anypony else to see this. Besides, I'm sure it'll clear up after a good night's sleep."
Molt Down,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,I can't believe you're still asleep!
Molt Down,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"It's nearly noon, and you promised to help me with my lecture for class today!"
Molt Down,Josh Haber,spike,Noon? Whoa! I slept like a rock! Which reminds me <U+0096> all that sleep probably cleared up my stone scale!
Molt Down,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"[gasps] Um, on second thought... [chuckles nervously] You can go back to sleep if you want."
Molt Down,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"Spike, what are you doing?"
Molt Down,Josh Haber,spike,Hiding from my hideous face!
Molt Down,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"I'm sure it feels terrible, but it's just a breakout. It's not the end of the world."
Molt Down,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,I used to get terrible breakouts any time I had a final exam with Celestia. Who probably never had a blemish her whole life.
Molt Down,Josh Haber,spike,"Well, I'm not in magic school."
Molt Down,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"No, but these things can be stress-related. And you did spend yesterday with Rarity."
Molt Down,Josh Haber,spike,[chuckles nervously] What could possibly be stressful about that?
Molt Down,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,[groans] You could try Zecora. She makes a cream that<U+0097>
Molt Down,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,Fine. But you're still gonna help me practice my lecture.
Molt Down,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,[clears throat] The element of generosity and its importance in relation to the other Elements of Harmony<U+0097>
Molt Down,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,[gasps] My lecture!
Molt Down,Josh Haber,spike,...indigestion. I'm so sorry!
Molt Down,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,[sighs] It's okay. I'm sure I can rewrite the lecture from my notes. I have a lot.
Molt Down,Josh Haber,spike,I can help you with<U+0097>
Molt Down,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,Maybe you should leave the castle after all. And go somewhere less... flammable?
Molt Down,Josh Haber,spike,"Hey there, not handsome."
Molt Down,Josh Haber,rarity,"[singsongy] Oh, Spike! My, what a fetching ensemble you put together. Very noir-esque. [giggles] I believe Shadow Spade herself would approve."
Molt Down,Josh Haber,spike,"Uh, thanks."
Molt Down,Josh Haber,rarity,But I wonder if you wouldn't mind taking it off.
Molt Down,Josh Haber,rarity,"Sorry, you'll have to speak up. My ears are a little bit clogged or something. It's just that I absolutely must have a model for my phoenix feather dress, and nopony else is available."
Molt Down,Josh Haber,spike,"Sorry, Rarity, but I... I am super busy all day giving... tours of the school!"
Molt Down,Josh Haber,pinkie pie,Really? I thought I was giving tours today. Guess not. Free day! Whee! Woo-hoo!
Molt Down,Josh Haber,spike,Classrooms are that way. [groans] Dorms are that way. [groans] Twilight's office is up there. This is a fountain.
Molt Down,Josh Haber,spike,"Oh. Um, yeah. [wincing, scratching] Sorry."
Molt Down,Josh Haber,spike,[low voice] I don't know.
Molt Down,Josh Haber,spike,"[low voice, straining] I don't... know!"
Molt Down,Josh Haber,spike,"[echoing] This is the school library! It's one of the most serene spots on campus, where students can spend time in quiet reflection or study! What?!"
Molt Down,Josh Haber,smolder,"Could you please stop shouting? We're trying to do our homework, and it's kind of distracting."
Molt Down,Josh Haber,spike,[loud voice] Was I shouting?!
Molt Down,Josh Haber,smolder,"If you're trying to hide, you need to do a better job. All I had to do was follow the smoke."
Molt Down,Josh Haber,spike,"[low voice, straining] Leave me alone!"
Molt Down,Josh Haber,smolder,What?
Molt Down,Josh Haber,spike,"[low voice, straining] Leave! Me! Alone!"
Molt Down,Josh Haber,smolder,"I can't under... Was that ""sleeves made of foam""?"
Molt Down,Josh Haber,smolder,"[laughs] Wow! I have seen some pretty bad molts in my time, but yours takes the cake!"
Molt Down,Josh Haber,spike,Molts?
Molt Down,Josh Haber,smolder,"The molt? Super painful stone scales, fire burps, uncontrollable volume shifts? It's all part of growing up dragon. Congrats!"
Molt Down,Josh Haber,smolder,Oh. Sorry.
Molt Down,Josh Haber,spike,"No-no-no-no-no. The last time I grew up, I turned into a giant greedy monster."
Molt Down,Josh Haber,smolder,"Greed-induced bigness. That's totally different. The molt is completely normal. Every dragon goes through it. Pretty soon, you'll leave and strike out on your own."
Molt Down,Josh Haber,spike,Why would I do that?
Molt Down,Josh Haber,smolder,Have you been living with ponies your whole life?
Molt Down,Josh Haber,spike,Uh-huh.
Molt Down,Josh Haber,smolder,"Oh. Well, in the Dragon Lands, a molter's loved ones kicks them out at the first stone scale."
Molt Down,Josh Haber,spike,What? Why?
Molt Down,Josh Haber,smolder,"I think it's biological. We call it the ""molt effect"". I haven't even told you about the smell."
Molt Down,Josh Haber,spike,Smell? [sniffs] Ugh!
Molt Down,Josh Haber,smolder,"Yeah. I mean, I love my brother and all, but one whiff, and I was all ""See ya!"" [sniffs] Speaking of which..."
Molt Down,Josh Haber,spike,"Wait! Does the molt effect happen to ponies too? [gasps] Twilight already asked me to leave the castle today. If she kicks me out, where am I gonna live? I'm too young to grow up!"
Molt Down,Josh Haber,smolder,I'm sure you'll find a nice...
Molt Down,Josh Haber,smolder,"...hoard of gems to guard or a village to terrorize. Oh, now that dragons and ponies are friends, I guess that's off the table."
Molt Down,Josh Haber,spike,So no creature's gonna wanna be around me?
Molt Down,Josh Haber,smolder,"Oh, I didn't say that. That molt stench is a magnet for predators. Tatzlwurms, hydras, rocs..."
Molt Down,Josh Haber,spike,Dragons are scared of rocks?
Molt Down,Josh Haber,smolder,R-O-C-S. Rocs? Humongous birds of prey that can snack on a molting dragon like candy!
Molt Down,Josh Haber,spike,"[low voice] So Twilight's kicking me out, and the only creatures who don't find me disgusting want to eat me?"
Molt Down,Josh Haber,smolder,"Seriously, I heard none of that."
Molt Down,Josh Haber,spike,"[loud voice] Twilight's kicking me out, and the only creatures who don't find me disgusting want to eat me?!"
Molt Down,Josh Haber,smolder,Congrats!
Molt Down,Josh Haber,pinkie pie,"[shouting] Hey! Is this the shouting closet?! Because I've got a free day, and I'm totally up for some shouting! [sniffs] [normal voice] Also, where's that brussel-sprouts-covered-in-cotton-candy smell coming from? Because it is really interesting."
Molt Down,Josh Haber,spike,"I didn't know where else to go. I can't take the chance that Twilight will kick me out. You aren't feeling any molt effects, are you?"
Molt Down,Josh Haber,zecora,"[nose plugged] When it comes to breakouts, I've seen all circumstances. But as with the molt smell... let's not take any chances."
Molt Down,Josh Haber,spike,"[scratches, sighs] Is there anything you can do to cure me?"
Molt Down,Josh Haber,zecora,The ailments you have aren't something to cure. The molt's a condition that dragons endure.
Molt Down,Josh Haber,spike,"[scratches] But if anypony sees or smells me right now, they'll be so grossed out, they'll avoid me forever!"
Molt Down,Josh Haber,zecora,"Perhaps we can lessen this strange molt effect. The smell is the most likely cause, I suspect."
Molt Down,Josh Haber,spike,[low voice] It's all so embarrassing.
Molt Down,Josh Haber,zecora,"I know you are speaking, but I can't hear a thing. Are you talking about teaching asparagus to sing?"
Molt Down,Josh Haber,spike,[low voice] I said it's [loud voice] embarrassing!
Molt Down,Josh Haber,zecora,"If the goal is to not have your friends all depart, perhaps your volume is where we should start."
Molt Down,Josh Haber,rarity,Zecora! Hello? Are you there?
Molt Down,Josh Haber,spike,[loud voice] I can't let Rarity see me like this! Please don't let her know I'm here!
Molt Down,Josh Haber,rarity,"[loudly] Oh, dear! I'm talking even louder than I thought, aren't I?!"
Molt Down,Josh Haber,zecora,I have volume concerns today by the scores. But it seems that I'm ready to help you with yours.
Molt Down,Josh Haber,rarity,"[loudly] Eh, I-I'm sorry?! I can't seem to hear anything! I was hoping you could help! I have no idea what happened! One minute, I was sewing phoenix feathers onto a dress, and the next I couldn't hear my own voice!"
Molt Down,Josh Haber,zecora,"Ah, the feathers of that bird can affect ponies' ears. It's a magic ailment I've treated for years."
Molt Down,Josh Haber,rarity,"[loudly] I only know you're talking 'cause your mouth is going up and down. [sighs, sniffs, coughs] [normal volume] Oh, goodness! I hope that incredibly pungent odor belongs to some sort of magical curative. [loudly] I hope you're not busy, but I must have my hearing back! It turns out that I talk to myself while I sew, and without that conversation, I simply can't think!"
Molt Down,Josh Haber,zecora,"It's a simple cure, and the directions are clear. Just one or two drops in each of your ears."
Molt Down,Josh Haber,rarity,"[sighs, normal volume] Oh, thank you. You're an ear saver. [loudly] Oh, and while I am here, do you have any blemish cream?! Spike is having some scale issues!"
Molt Down,Josh Haber,spike,[loud voice] You have no idea!
Molt Down,Josh Haber,rarity,"[gasps, normal voice] I think I heard something! [loudly] Your cure is working already!"
Molt Down,Josh Haber,zecora,The cream that you want is just over here. It's a popular potion for all creatures this year.
Molt Down,Josh Haber,rarity,"[sighs, normal voice] Thank you, Zecora."
Molt Down,Josh Haber,rarity,"[loudly] I don't mean to be rude, but I do think your hut could use an airing out!"
Molt Down,Josh Haber,zecora,"Rarity's gone. There's no need to hide. [sniffs, groans] Though I wonder if we should continue outside. Can't treat your symptoms down there on the ground. It's safe to come out. There's no ponies around."
Molt Down,Josh Haber,spike,I'm not hiding from ponies. I'm hiding from that!
Molt Down,Josh Haber,spike,Did I forget to mention the molt smell attracts predators?
Molt Down,Josh Haber,zecora,That's something that would've been quite nice to know! But it's not worth discussing right now! We should go!
Molt Down,Josh Haber,spike,"Okay, maybe this wasn't a good plan."
Molt Down,Josh Haber,rarity,"Oh, Spike. What are you doing here?"
Molt Down,Josh Haber,spike,Rarity! You have to get out of here! There's a giant roc trying to eat me! It's got Zecora!
Molt Down,Josh Haber,rarity,"Yes, what? [loudly] I was just at Zecora's, but I'm heading back! I can't read these instructions! Does this say ""two drops once a day"" or ""one drop twice a day""?!"
Molt Down,Josh Haber,spike,"Rarity, there's no time! We have to get help!"
Molt Down,Josh Haber,rarity,"[loudly] Yes, my ears are completely clogged! Why, Spike! Your stone scales look worse! Oh, here! I picked up just the thing. Ah<U+0097>"
Molt Down,Josh Haber,zecora,"Oh, I wish you'd escaped either claw of this bird! But the both of us trapped in the same one's absurd!"
Molt Down,Josh Haber,rarity,[loudly] What?!
Molt Down,Josh Haber,spike,[groans] Let my ponies go!
Molt Down,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"Spike, what are you doing?"
Molt Down,Josh Haber,spike,"If my stone scales didn't itch so much and we weren't in immediate danger, this would be [chuckles] really embarrassing!"
Molt Down,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,Danger?
Molt Down,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"Well, I was headed to Zecora's to get some cream for your scales. I had no idea you were<U+0097>"
Molt Down,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,Molt smell?
Molt Down,Josh Haber,rarity,[high-pitched] Twilight!
Molt Down,Josh Haber,spike,Whoa!
Molt Down,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,Was that Rarity?
Molt Down,Josh Haber,spike,"And Zecora! I tried to save them, but it's all I can do to stop scratching long enough to dive out of the way when that bird attacks!"
Molt Down,Josh Haber,spike,"[gasps, sighs] Finally! I didn't think that itching would ever stop!"
Molt Down,Josh Haber,spike,What's happening?! I... I can't move!
Molt Down,Josh Haber,spike,What just... happened? Did I just sprout wings? I just sprouted wings!
Molt Down,Josh Haber,spike,Whoops.
Molt Down,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,Spike?! How did you get wings?!
Molt Down,Josh Haber,spike,I don't know! But they're pretty aweso<U+0096> Whoa!
Molt Down,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,Do you think you can fly up and distract him while I work on freeing Zecora and Rarity?
Molt Down,Josh Haber,spike,"Hey, giant chicken! If you like dragons so much, come and get me!"
Molt Down,Josh Haber,spike,Greetings.
Molt Down,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,Spike!
Molt Down,Josh Haber,zecora,I know that the molt produced surprising things. But I'm glad that the last was a new pair of wings!
Molt Down,Josh Haber,rarity,"[loudly] Yes! And also, I'm glad you've got wings!"
Molt Down,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,This is amazing! I didn't know if you'd ever get wings. I'm so happy for you. Does it have something to do with this molt you were talking about?
Molt Down,Josh Haber,spike,"[sighs] It's what's been going on with me. The breakout, the fire burps. The molt is when dragons get older and start to change. I wish I could stop it, but I can't. I-I should go."
Molt Down,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,Go? What are you talking about?
Molt Down,Josh Haber,spike,"In the Dragon Lands, families make molters leave home. It's called the molt effect."
Molt Down,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"Well, this isn't the Dragon Lands, and molt effect or no, I don't want you going anywhere."
Molt Down,Josh Haber,spike,But I'm growing up. What if something even worse happens?
Molt Down,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"You're supposed to grow up, but you'll always be you. And whatever happens, we'll get through it together."
Molt Down,Josh Haber,spike,Woo-hoo! Yeah! Woo-hoo! Look at me! Let's go home!
Molt Down,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"Uh, I don't need to carry you anymore, do I? You have wings."
Molt Down,Josh Haber,spike,"They are new, and I don't want to overdo it."
Molt Down,Josh Haber,rarity,"I can't believe you thought any of us would send you away because of some silly molt effect. [sighs] Even if the symptoms were slightly unsettling. And let's face it, the odor wasn't pleasant. Nopony would stop caring for you just because you were getting older. Everypony goes through changes, but sometimes change can be wonderful. Like being able to model for any length of dress! [giggles] Uh, a bit higher, darling, please?"
Molt Down,Josh Haber,spike,"I'm glad to help, Rarity. But don't you think there's wonderful things about flying that don't involve dresses?"
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,scootaloo,"Whoa, whoa, whoa!"
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,scootaloo,Almost... there...
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,apple bloom,Ah! I can't wait! Twilight's school is supposed to be amazin' inside!
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,sweetie belle,[whispering] Rarity says there's never been a school like it!
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,scootaloo,[grunting] I heard the students get to do tons of awesome stuff!
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,apple bloom,Do ya see anything yet?
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,scootaloo,"Uh, yeah. It looks like a broom! And a dustpan and some buckets."
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,sweetie belle,That sounds like a closet.
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,apple bloom,Try another window.
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,cutie mark crusaders,"Whoa, whoa, whoa!"
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,scootaloo,Whoa...
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,pinkie pie,Whooooo's ready for cupcakes?!
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,pinkie pie,"Oh, they're not for you, silly. They're for sharing! First, say something nice like this. Ocellus, you are a great listener! Now you get to keep one cupcake and share one with another creature."
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,ocellus,"Yona, you're really strong!"
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,pinkie pie,Ugh!
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,cutie mark crusaders,Whoa!
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,fluttershy,"All right, students! It's time to meet some new friends!"
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,applejack,"That's friendship in action, y'all!"
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,sweetie belle,Wow! And I thought our school was fun!
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,scootaloo,Yeah! Miss Cheerilee never lets us play buckball in class. I know. I've tried.
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,apple bloom,"Hey! Why don't we go here instead? It's still school, right?"
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,cutie mark crusaders,[cheering] Great idea!
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,apple bloom,[sighs] What could be better than learnin' friendship with your best friends?
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,twilight sparkle,"[clears throat] Good morning, class. Today, we're going to learn about friendship through the ages. Spike, slide one, please."
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,twilight sparkle,"Back in the days of Chancellor Puddinghead... Uh, Spike?"
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,spike,"Huh? Sorry, Twilight. Still getting used to my new wings. They're pretty great, huh?"
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,twilight sparkle,"Yes, Spike. As I was saying... Huh? What are you three doing here?"
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,apple bloom,We wanna go to your school!
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,twilight sparkle,But why?
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,sweetie belle,We wanna learn friendship!
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,scootaloo,And play buckball!
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,twilight sparkle,"I see. Why don't you three come with me? Spike, you're in charge."
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,spike,Yes!
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,starlight glimmer,"Hi, Twilight! Looks like you could use a guidance counselor's help! Hint, hint."
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,twilight sparkle,"No, thanks, Starlight. I've got this."
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,starlight glimmer,"[sadly] Great. Well, I'll just... go dust my office for the seventieth time."
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,twilight sparkle,"[to Cutie Mark Crusaders] I'm sorry to have to tell you this, but... you can't be my students."
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,sweetie belle,Why not?
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,scootaloo,Isn't this place for everycreature?
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,twilight sparkle,"Yes, but we teach friendship lessons here. You already know all about helping ponies in need and being there for each other."
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,sweetie belle,Can't you just give us a chance?
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,cutie mark crusaders,Pleeeeeeeeeeeaaaase?
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,twilight sparkle,"You need Cheerilee's classes, not mine. Hurry up. You don't want late marks on your permanent record."
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,twilight sparkle,Spike?! What did you do?
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,scootaloo,"[sighs] Well, I'm not giving up! I know we can prove we belong in this school!"
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,sweetie belle,Yeah! Um... how?
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,apple bloom,By showin' Twilight we've still got lots to learn about friendship. And I know just where to start.
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,applejack,[grunts] What in tarnation? Apple Bloom! You know better than to leave our good tools out like that! And aren't you supposed to be on harvest duty right now?
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,apple bloom,"Eh, it's not like the apples are goin' anywhere."
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,applejack,[stammering] What's gotten into you? Those chores are your responsibility! Farm work is family work!
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,apple bloom,"Sorry, Applejack. Maybe if I went to Twilight's school, I'd learn to be better at helpin' the family."
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,applejack,"Ahhh. So that's what this is all about. Well, if it's learnin' you want, I'd be happy to give you a private lesson right now... [angrily] Startin' with cleanin' up all this equipment!"
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,apple bloom,Hmph!
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,sweetie belle,Please can I go to Twilight's school?!
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,sweetie belle,Please? Please?!
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,sweetie belle,How 'bout now?
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,rainbow dash,"So there I was, leading the Wonderbolt formation into a super dangerous Sundown Spiral, when suddenly... [imitates whooshing] There was a huge storm cloud in our way!"
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,rainbow dash,"My genius happened! I changed the routine on the fly! And because my crew are such tight friends, they followed me!"
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,rainbow dash,Only the coolest thing ever! I flew up and<U+0097>
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,scootaloo,Did a super-amazing half-twist into a backflip sonic rainboom?!
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,rainbow dash,Hey! I never told that story to my students before. Scootaloo!
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,sweetie belle,They're coming! Get ready!
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,scootaloo,Look out!
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,apple bloom,[stiltedly] Look out! Whoa!
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,scootaloo,[stiltedly] Hey! Watch where you are going!
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,apple bloom,[stiltedly] I was watching! Watching you drive like a crazy pony!
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,scootaloo,"[stiltedly] Well, maybe if you did not drop apples all over the street, I would not have to!"
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,fluttershy,Ooh. I've never seen Apple Bloom and Scootaloo argue like this.
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,pinkie pie,Yeah. They usually go together like candy canes and stripes.
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,sweetie belle,Whoa! Oof!
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,apple bloom,"[stiltedly] My apples? This is all your fault, Scootaloo!"
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,scootaloo,"[stiltedly] Hey, Sweetie Belle is the clumsy one!"
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,sweetie belle,[stiltedly] I'm not talking to either one of you ever again!
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,fluttershy,Goodness. They seem really upset.
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,pinkie pie,It's almost like they forgot they're friends.
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,scootaloo,[quietly] I think it's working!
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,sweetie belle,"[stiltedly] You are so careless! [quietly] Good plan, Apple Bloom!"
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,apple bloom,"[stiltedly] Careless? I will show you who is the one who is careless! [quietly] And great acting, Sweetie Belle!"
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,scootaloo,[out loud] We're an awesome team!
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,apple bloom,All right!
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,pinkie pie,Yay!
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,apple bloom,Oops.
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,pinkie pie,You're friends again! I knew you would be! Candy cane stripes forever!
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,scootaloo,Now they'll never let us into Twilight's school.
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,apple bloom,"Okay, we've tried shirkin' chores, pesterin', disguises, fightin'."
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,sweetie belle,Hmmm... We need to do something new. Something unexpected.
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,apple bloom,"Great idea, Scootaloo! We haven't tried cryin' yet."
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,sweetie belle,Yeah! It always works for Rarity.
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,scootaloo,I wasn't crying. I think it's coming from outside.
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,sweetie belle,Aww. She looks so sad. We better go see what's wrong.
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,apple bloom,Hey. Are you okay?
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,cozy glow,Oh. Thank you for asking. But no. I'm having real trouble with... [sniffling] ...the School of Friendship.
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,scootaloo,"Twilight won't let you go either, huh?"
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,sweetie belle,Really?
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,cozy glow,"I just moved here to go to school, but everything's so new and different. I don't know anypony."
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,apple bloom,"Well, now you do. I'm Apple Bloom. This is Sweetie Belle and Scootaloo. We're the Cutie Mark Crusaders."
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,cozy glow,"[sniffs] I'm Cozy Glow. It's very nice to meet you, but I don't know if I'll stay long. I'll probably flunk out. I'm having so much trouble with my friendship lessons."
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,sweetie belle,We can help with those!
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,scootaloo,We know all about friendship!
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,apple bloom,And studyin' with you would be almost as good as bein' in class!
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,cozy glow,But why would you help me? What's in it for you?
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,sweetie belle,"That's how friendship works. When you give from your heart, you don't expect anything back."
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,cozy glow,"Well, golly, if you really mean it..."
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,cutie mark crusaders,Uh-huh!
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,cozy glow,I could use some help with my homework. I have to do something nice for each of these ponies. But I don't know anything about them. And it's so hard to talk to ponies you've never met.
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,apple bloom,"Well, you're in luck, 'cause we know all of those ponies!"
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,scootaloo,Get ready for a friendship A-plus!
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,scootaloo,"That's Bon Bon. If you wanna do something nice for her, first you gotta figure out what she needs."
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,cozy glow,"Well, how am I supposed to do that?"
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,scootaloo,Just pay attention. Friendship is about listening to others.
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,sweetie drops,Ow. Ow.
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,scootaloo,"Uh-oh. That cactus keeps pricking her every step she takes. Hmm, if only there was something to protect her from those spines."
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,sweetie drops,Thank you! That's so thoughtful.
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,cozy glow,I did it!
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,scootaloo,"Good job! But, uh, next time, maybe don't give away my helmet."
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,cozy glow,Oopsie.
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,sweetie belle,"Green, purple, yellow. And one more purple. Whew. Sorting all those took longer than I thought."
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,cozy glow,You really think Mrs. Cake will like these new sprinkle shakers?
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,sweetie belle,Mm-hmm. Now she won't have to use rainbow sprinkles all the time. She can just pick the color she wants!
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,mrs. cake,"Mrs. Ooh! I'm sorry, I was out to lunch. Were you fillies waiting for me long?"
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,cozy glow,"No. Um, these are for you!"
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,mrs. cake,"Mrs. Oh, well, what a lovely surprise! I can't wait to try them out!"
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,mrs. cake,Mrs. Look! I made rainbow sprinkles! Aren't they wonderful?
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,sweetie belle,At least she likes her present?
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,cozy glow,Uh-huh...
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,cozy glow,Golly. How'd you know that would make him so happy?
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,apple bloom,Friendship means pitchin' in to help others' chores go faster. 'Specially when their special somepony's waitin' for 'em.
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,scootaloo,[groans] That class was so boring!
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,sweetie belle,Not even Miss Cheerilee can make the history of radishes exciting.
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,apple bloom,I bet they don't have to learn about that stuff at Twilight's school.
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,cozy glow,Guess what! I got an A on my homework!
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,apple bloom,Nice goin'!
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,cozy glow,And I never could have done it without your help!
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,sweetie belle,No problem!
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,scootaloo,We just wish we could have done more.
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,cozy glow,"Actually, you can. Headmare Twilight is giving us a big test at the end of the week, and I could really use your help studying."
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,apple bloom,We wanted to go to Twilight's school more than anything. But helpin' you has been even more fun! You can count on us!
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,cozy glow,Um... intelligence?
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,cozy glow,Laughter?
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,sweetie belle,Yes!
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,cozy glow,Is it... control?
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,cozy glow,Kindness! Loyalty! Honesty! Generosity! Laughter! Magic!
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,apple bloom,How'd the test go?
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,sweetie belle,Were there essay questions?
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,scootaloo,Did you remember what we taught you?
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,apple bloom,But how could Cozy Glow fail her friendship test?
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,twilight sparkle,Ahem. I'd like to see you three in my office!
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,scootaloo,"[quietly] I know we wanted to be invited inside, but it kinda went different in my head."
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,twilight sparkle,I can't believe you'd do something like this!
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,apple bloom,Like what?
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,twilight sparkle,"You are Cozy Glow's tutors, aren't you?"
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,scootaloo,We've been working with her for days!
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,twilight sparkle,That's what she told me. So you've been setting her up to fail?
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,twilight sparkle,"I know you're upset that I won't let you come to my school, but to teach Cozy all the wrong things out of spite... That's just cruel!"
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,sweetie belle,But we taught her all the right things!
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,twilight sparkle,"Then how do you explain these friendship test answers? [reading] ""What are the six Elements of Harmony?"" Five turtlenecks and a cheese grater? ""Who is the Princess of Friendship?"" Your mom?"
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,apple bloom,I... I don't understand.
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,twilight sparkle,Me neither. I never thought you three would pull such a mean prank. I'm afraid I'm gonna have to ask you to stay away from my school. And my students.
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,cozy glow,"Oh, no!"
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,starlight glimmer,Hmm? [dryly] Yay. Now I'll alphabetize them in reverse order. [sighs] Not much need for a guidance counselor at a school of friendship.
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,starlight glimmer,Aah!
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,starlight glimmer,"How much of that did you hear?! Uh, never mind."
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,starlight glimmer,[laughs nervously] Welcome! Can I get you a comfort pillow? Security blanket? Empathy cocoa?
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,cozy glow,"Uh, I just need some advice."
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,starlight glimmer,"Oh! Well, I have plenty of that! Anecdotes, insight, midnight confessions... I'm babbling. [clears throat] Go ahead. I'm listening."
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,cozy glow,"I think I got my friends in trouble. They helped me study for my friendship test, and I failed it... on purpose."
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,cozy glow,"Well, the Cutie Mark Crusaders wanted to go to this school more than anything. So I thought if I showed Headmare Twilight they're bad at friendship, she'd let them come here with me."
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,cozy glow,I guess I still have a lot to learn about friendship.
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,starlight glimmer,"Actually, I think you're doing all right. Sure, that was a really, really bad way to try to help your friends, but what matters is you wanted to. The reason the Cutie Mark Crusaders don't go to this school is because they'd make better teachers than students."
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,cozy glow,So you do have a place for them here?
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,starlight glimmer,Hmmm...
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,apple bloom,"[groans] I bet there's no ""Wonderful World of Cleaning"" lesson at Twilight's school."
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,sweetie belle,[coughs] We'll never find out now.
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,scootaloo,[sighs] I still don't get how Cozy failed her test after all that studying.
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,sweetie belle,Or how Twilight could blame us for it!
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,apple bloom,Or how gum can be so sticky!
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,starlight glimmer,"Sorry to interrupt, Miss Cheerilee. But can I borrow Apple Bloom, Sweetie Belle, and Scootaloo?"
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,scootaloo,We didn't do anything wrong! We promise!
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,twilight sparkle,I know that. Now. Which is why I wanted to talk to you.
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,sweetie belle,Wait. So we're not in trouble?
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,starlight glimmer,"Just the opposite. Cozy Glow, is there something you'd like to say?"
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,cozy glow,This is all my fault. I messed up my test on purpose so we could all go to school together. I'm sorry.
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,twilight sparkle,"Thank you, Cozy Glow. Honesty is one of the pillars of friendship. [to Cutie Mark Crusaders] But you already know that. Which is why I'd like to give you these."
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,applejack,"They're honorary diplomas, makin' y'all official graduates of this here school."
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,rarity,You've more than earned them.
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,rainbow dash,Without even having to study!
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,cutie mark crusaders,[chanting] We are graduates! We are graduates! We are graduates!
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,twilight sparkle,"And if you're interested, I think Starlight has a place for you at my school after all."
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,cutie mark crusaders,Woo-hoo!
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,starlight glimmer,We could use some friendship tutors on staff. And I hear you're the best out there.
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,apple bloom,"Then what are we waitin' for? Let's get tutorin'! Come on, Cozy!"
Marks for Effort,Nicole Dubuc,twilight sparkle,And that's why this school needs you as our guidance counselor.
The Mean 6,Michael Vogel,twilight sparkle,"[sighs] I've been planning this retreat for weeks, and we're already ten minutes behind! Where is that photographer?!"
The Mean 6,Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,Of course. I'll help you set up your<U+0097>
The Mean 6,Michael Vogel,rainbow dash,Ow! Hey!
The Mean 6,Michael Vogel,pinkie pie,"Waaaait! You forgot Starlight! She needs a picture, too!"
The Mean 6,Michael Vogel,queen chrysalis,"Yes, I know! We have been planning this for quite some time. [laughing evilly] Oh, thank you, Applejack. My spell can create a copy of anypony I desire. All I need is an image and a piece of the pony. [sniffs] Oh, and this."
The Mean 6,Michael Vogel,queen chrysalis,"Why copies, Rarity? Because Princess Twilight and her friends control the Elements of Harmony, the most powerful weapon in all Equestria."
The Mean 6,Michael Vogel,queen chrysalis,Which means you - will - be - able - to - use - them - too!
The Mean 6,Michael Vogel,queen chrysalis,And serve me!
The Mean 6,Michael Vogel,queen chrysalis,"Together, we will destroy Twilight Sparkle and her meddlesome friends!"
The Mean 6,Michael Vogel,queen chrysalis,"With the Elements under my control, I'll build a new hive of Earth ponies, unicorns, and Pegasi, and I will rule as Queen once again!"
The Mean 6,Michael Vogel,twilight sparkle,Hmm. At least our retreat isn't too far behind schedule. Get ready for fun!
The Mean 6,Michael Vogel,rainbow dash,"Are we talking fun fun, or learning pretending to be fun?"
The Mean 6,Michael Vogel,twilight sparkle,"Both! We've all been so busy teaching, we've hardly had a chance to hang out with each other. And I may have scheduled some friendship activities as well!"
The Mean 6,Michael Vogel,pinkie pie,Count me in! We can do friendship trust falls and pony pyramids! Oh! And hide and seek! Quick! Find me!
The Mean 6,Michael Vogel,fluttershy,"Well, I love the idea of some quiet time with my best friends."
The Mean 6,Michael Vogel,pinkie pie,[screams] You found me!
The Mean 6,Michael Vogel,rainbow dash,"Rarity, why is Applejack carrying all your stuff?"
The Mean 6,Michael Vogel,rarity,"Oh, that's not mine. Yes, I used to overpack a tad, but now it's just the essentials for me. I'm a simple filly."
The Mean 6,Michael Vogel,applejack,"Normally I wouldn't lug so much gear, but did y'all know this is Starlight's first time campin'?"
The Mean 6,Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,"I just never really felt the need to... ""hang out"" in nature."
The Mean 6,Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,"Home has books, tea, fewer bugs, a roof..."
The Mean 6,Michael Vogel,applejack,That attitude right there is why I brought the whole kit and caboodle. I'm givin' Starlight the full Apple family campin' experience!
The Mean 6,Michael Vogel,fluttershy,"Um, where are we camping?"
The Mean 6,Michael Vogel,twilight sparkle,Right next to the Elements that brought us all together in the first place <U+0096> the Tree of Harmony!
The Mean 6,Michael Vogel,queen chrysalis,Listen to your queen! We must retrieve the Elements of Harmony!
The Mean 6,Michael Vogel,queen chrysalis,Excuse me?
The Mean 6,Michael Vogel,queen chrysalis,They've defeated my army. I know better than to strike alone. I need<U+0097>
The Mean 6,Michael Vogel,queen chrysalis,Servants! And the power of the Elements!
The Mean 6,Michael Vogel,queen chrysalis,The location of the most powerful weapon in Equestria isn't something made known to just anypony. I learned they were hidden somewhere in this forest.
The Mean 6,Michael Vogel,pinkie pie,"Everypony, stop! And smell these roses! [sniffs] Ahhh! Oh, yeah!"
The Mean 6,Michael Vogel,twilight sparkle,"[nervous giggle] Right. Roses. Fun. Now, let<U+0092>s try and stay on schedule."
The Mean 6,Michael Vogel,rarity,"Applejack, darling, anything in that wagon for mane maintenance?"
The Mean 6,Michael Vogel,applejack,"Uh, let's see here. Uh... all right. I got a bandana!"
The Mean 6,Michael Vogel,rarity,"Ugh, an entire wagon and no anti-frizz? Darling, you're not even prepared."
The Mean 6,Michael Vogel,applejack,"I am! For campin'? How ya doin', Starlight?"
The Mean 6,Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,Whoa! Ugh. [flatly] Great.
The Mean 6,Michael Vogel,fluttershy,"Oh, no! You and your sister fell out of your nest and got separated? That's terrible! Here. I'm sure your home isn't too far away."
The Mean 6,Michael Vogel,twilight sparkle,"[yelps] Pinkie! If we keep stopping to have fun, we're never gonna get to the fun things I've got planned!"
The Mean 6,Michael Vogel,pinkie pie,[gasps] Good point! Last one to the Tree of Harmony is a parasprite! Whoo-hoo!
The Mean 6,Michael Vogel,queen chrysalis,"The quicker we search the forest, the quicker we find the Elements."
The Mean 6,Michael Vogel,queen chrysalis,Where... are... the others?!
The Mean 6,Michael Vogel,queen chrysalis,Turn around. We're going back.
The Mean 6,Michael Vogel,queen chrysalis,Very well. You have my permission.
The Mean 6,Michael Vogel,pinkie pie,"You're it! Hey, how'd you get ahead of me? You're fast."
The Mean 6,Michael Vogel,pinkie pie,Aren't they back there?
The Mean 6,Michael Vogel,pinkie pie,Sure! Unless they're already at the Tree of Harmony.
The Mean 6,Michael Vogel,pinkie pie,"Oh-ho-ho. This is one of your ""activities"", right? Like a friendship quiz? It's the crystal tree that holds the Elements of Harmony. Boom!"
The Mean 6,Michael Vogel,pinkie pie,[imitates buzzer] It's at the bottom of the stairs in the ravine by the Castle of the Two Sisters. Double boom!
The Mean 6,Michael Vogel,pinkie pie,"Mm-hmm. Honestly, Twilight, these questions are super easy."
The Mean 6,Michael Vogel,fluttershy,Right where you belong.
The Mean 6,Michael Vogel,fluttershy,"Oh, dear. This isn't where I belong. Oh, Rainbow Dash! I'm so glad you're here. I was lost."
The Mean 6,Michael Vogel,fluttershy,What just happened?
The Mean 6,Michael Vogel,twilight sparkle,"Oh, fantastic. First Pinkie races ahead of us, and now Fluttershy's lost somewhere behind us. My retreat is off to a great start!"
The Mean 6,Michael Vogel,rarity,It's not like Fluttershy to disappear like this.
The Mean 6,Michael Vogel,applejack,"We'll split up and search for her. We can all meet back at the Tree. Starlight, take the navigation gear and<U+0097>"
The Mean 6,Michael Vogel,twilight sparkle,I'll find Pinkie Pie.
The Mean 6,Michael Vogel,queen chrysalis,This is ridiculous! Where are my other minions?!
The Mean 6,Michael Vogel,queen chrysalis,[growls] Enough!
The Mean 6,Michael Vogel,queen chrysalis,"You will go out there and find the others, you will bring them back here, and we will steal the Elements of Harmony so I can destroy Starlight's life like she destroyed mine! [through gritted teeth] Understand?"
The Mean 6,Michael Vogel,fluttershy,"Hello again, little friend. I think I may be walking in circles."
The Mean 6,Michael Vogel,fluttershy,"[gasps] Oh, my! Where did you learn that kind of language? Um, excuse me?"
The Mean 6,Michael Vogel,rainbow dash,Me? We're looking for Fluttershy!
The Mean 6,Michael Vogel,applejack,Where's Starlight?
The Mean 6,Michael Vogel,rainbow dash,[grunts] Hey!
The Mean 6,Michael Vogel,applejack,"Rarity, what in the hay are you gonna do with a fishin' rod?"
The Mean 6,Michael Vogel,rarity,"Starlight, darling, you're a gloriously bad camper. And coming from me, that is saying a lot."
The Mean 6,Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,I know. Want to break it to Applejack for me?
The Mean 6,Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,"Very funny, Applejack. Still me under all this gear. Starlight."
The Mean 6,Michael Vogel,rarity,"Applejack, darling, are you all right? You look a little peaky. And where's your wagon?"
The Mean 6,Michael Vogel,twilight sparkle,Pinkie! There you are! What are you doing?
The Mean 6,Michael Vogel,twilight sparkle,I thought you were racing to the retreat.
The Mean 6,Michael Vogel,twilight sparkle,What? Rainbow Dash! I think something's wrong with Pinkie!
The Mean 6,Michael Vogel,pinkie pie,Fluttershy! What's wrong?
The Mean 6,Michael Vogel,fluttershy,[crying] Everycreature is mad at me!
The Mean 6,Michael Vogel,pinkie pie,[gasps] What?! That can't be right!
The Mean 6,Michael Vogel,pinkie pie,"Twilight, your schedule can wait! Fluttershy's upset."
The Mean 6,Michael Vogel,twilight sparkle,"Oh, great. You upset Fluttershy, too?"
The Mean 6,Michael Vogel,pinkie pie,"You know what, Twilight? Maybe if you weren't so worried about schedules, you'd realize you're the one ruining the retreat for your friends!"
The Mean 6,Michael Vogel,twilight sparkle,"[gasps] Well, if my friends don't care about the retreat I planned for them... maybe they should've stayed home!"
The Mean 6,Michael Vogel,queen chrysalis,Your plan?
The Mean 6,Michael Vogel,queen chrysalis,Grub-sitting you six is nothing like controlling my hive! Give me one good reason why I shouldn't just destroy you all and start over!
The Mean 6,Michael Vogel,rainbow dash,[to Applejack] I'm guessing some kind of curse? Maybe poison joke?
The Mean 6,Michael Vogel,applejack,"Well, somethin' sure ain't right."
The Mean 6,Michael Vogel,applejack,Hang on. I got a shovel we can use to whack those vines out of the way.
The Mean 6,Michael Vogel,rarity,Really? I can't believe you've never told us that story before.
The Mean 6,Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,She's making a point. We get it. You're the greatest camper in the history of Equestria.
The Mean 6,Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,"Uh, the things you gave me are silly?!"
The Mean 6,Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,"[gasps, tearing up] Glad I was so entertaining for you!"
The Mean 6,Michael Vogel,rarity,"[to Mean Applejack] I'm going to make sure that she doesn't break a hoof out there, and then you and I are going to have a serious talk!"
The Mean 6,Michael Vogel,queen chrysalis,Finally! There. That's all of you. Nopony leaves without my say-so.
The Mean 6,Michael Vogel,rarity,Starlight! Oh! Please stop running!
The Mean 6,Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,Ugh!
The Mean 6,Michael Vogel,twilight sparkle,Of course I care about Fluttershy!
The Mean 6,Michael Vogel,pinkie pie,Then you've got a super weird way of showing it!
The Mean 6,Michael Vogel,rarity,W-What in Equestria's going on here?
The Mean 6,Michael Vogel,pinkie pie,"Twilight is so into her retreat that she doesn't even care if her friends are upset! She just wants us to ""stay on schedule""!"
The Mean 6,Michael Vogel,twilight sparkle,"Well, I'm sorry, Pinkie! If I knew you thought this was a ""boring, lame, no-fun retreat"", I wouldn't have invited you in the first place!"
The Mean 6,Michael Vogel,pinkie pie,I never said that!
The Mean 6,Michael Vogel,applejack,"Sorry, y'all. We would've been here sooner, but we had to take the long way after Rarity ran off with all my stuff."
The Mean 6,Michael Vogel,rarity,Wha<U+0097>?! I most certainly did not!
The Mean 6,Michael Vogel,applejack,What?! You know I ain't no liar! [to Starlight Glimmer] Where's all your gear?
The Mean 6,Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,Why? So you can laugh at me some more?!
The Mean 6,Michael Vogel,rainbow dash,"Hey, hey, we're all friends here!"
The Mean 6,Michael Vogel,twilight sparkle,"Everypony, quiet! Listen. We know each other really well <U+0097> the great stuff and how to get on each other's nerves, too. I wanted a fun trip with my friends. But instead, I got carried away with plans and ruined everything. If you want to forget it all and head home, I won't be offended. I just want us to stop fighting."
The Mean 6,Michael Vogel,applejack,"[to Starlight Glimmer] Hey, sorry if I got carried away with all that campin' stuff."
The Mean 6,Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,"I'm sorry, too. I should've just told you I'll never like camping. Also, I'll never like camping."
The Mean 6,Michael Vogel,rarity,"Well, if we're all being honest, I can't survive with just this tiny yet fashionable little saddlebag! I miss my things!"
The Mean 6,Michael Vogel,pinkie pie,[to Twilight Sparkle] I'm sorry that you thought that I thought your plan was lame. Your plans are the most un-lamest!
The Mean 6,Michael Vogel,rainbow dash,And I always have fun when we're all together. Even if it's learning pretending to be fun.
The Mean 6,Michael Vogel,twilight sparkle,So... does that mean you still want to have the retreat?
The Mean 6,Michael Vogel,fluttershy,If everypony likes me again.
The Mean 6,Michael Vogel,twilight sparkle,Let's get to that Tree. I have the whole campsite set up and ready.
The Mean 6,Michael Vogel,queen chrysalis,Just! Retrieve! The Elements!
The Mean 6,Michael Vogel,queen chrysalis,How dare you! I created you!
The Mean 6,Michael Vogel,queen chrysalis,"Servants always fail you in the end! Just wait, Starlight. I will have my revenge!"
The Mean 6,Michael Vogel,twilight sparkle,[gasps] Are you kidding me?
The Mean 6,Michael Vogel,pinkie pie,[laughing] This was... the worst... day... ever!
The Mean 6,Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,"Come on, everypony. We can fix this campsite in no time."
The Mean 6,Michael Vogel,applejack,Spoken like a true camper.
The Mean 6,Michael Vogel,starlight glimmer,"Eh, don't push it."
The Mean 6,Michael Vogel,twilight sparkle,"You know, if we can survive a day like this, I think our friendship is strong enough to handle anything the world can throw at us."
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,twilight sparkle,Who can tell me what these are?
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,sandbar,Whoa...
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,gallus,Me likey...
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,yona,Shiny!
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,smolder,Treasure?
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,ocellus,Nope! They're all legendary magical artifacts!
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,ocellus,Heh-heh. I've read ahead in Equestrian Cultures and Camaraderie: Volume Seven.
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,twilight sparkle,"You're right, Ocellus. This is the Amulet of Aurora, the Talisman of Mirage, the Helm of Yksler, the Crown of Grover, Knuckerbocker's Shell, and Clover the Clever's Cloak."
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,spike,"And the gems are real! Eh, not that I... tasted them."
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,twilight sparkle,"Princess Celestia gifted these to our school, since they each represent one of the cultures our students come from. And we'll learn all about them in a Spell-venger Hunt!"
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,smolder,"[aside, to Sandbar] Is that a pony thing?"
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,sandbar,Eh.
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,twilight sparkle,It's a magical scavenger hunt. Each of you will work in pairs to try to find where in the school these artifacts are hidden.
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,spike,The team that finds the most wins a private tour of the Canterlot Archives with Princess Celestia.
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,silverstream,[excited squeal] Learning and fun?! Does it get any better than that?!
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,gallus,"You've been underwater a long time, haven't you?"
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,twilight sparkle,"Gallus and Silverstream, sounds like you're our first pair!"
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,twilight sparkle,What? They'll make a great team.
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,yona,"Um, why pony glowing?"
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,twilight sparkle,"Wait. You all were called on this friendship quest, too?"
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,fluttershy,It must be a really important one.
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,rarity,And terribly far away.
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,rainbow dash,Just getting there will take days!
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,applejack,Do y'all know what this means? There won't be any teachers left to run the school!
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,fluttershy,Should we send our students home?
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,pinkie pie,I say we take 'em with us! Road trip!
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,applejack,Problem is we don't even know how long we'll be gone.
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,twilight sparkle,"Don't worry, everypony. I already have a seventy-point plan in place for this very situation."
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,starlight glimmer,You want me to be headmare?!
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,twilight sparkle,You're the perfect choice! You're a good leader and an expert in friendship. I trust you to run this school exactly as I would.
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,starlight glimmer,"Uh, that's a pretty big responsibility, Twilight."
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,twilight sparkle,Which is why I've prepared everything you need.
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,twilight sparkle,"The curriculum, rules for the Spell-venger Hunt, dining hall menus for the next six months..."
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,spike,"Six months?! You're not really gonna be gone that long, are you?"
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,twilight sparkle,"...and Spike. Anything that isn't covered in my files, he'll be able to help you with."
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,starlight glimmer,Then why not put him in charge?
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,spike,"No-ho-ho, thanks. Eh, being a princess for Twilight was hard enough."
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,starlight glimmer,"I'm gonna pretend that made sense. But if you're sure it's what you really want, I promise I won't let you down."
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,twilight sparkle,I knew I could count on you.
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,starlight glimmer,Great. What could possibly go wrong?
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,spike,"Goodbye, Rarity! A-And everypony!"
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,starlight glimmer,Come back soon! Please!
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,starlight glimmer,Huh?
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,discord,"[through mock tears] I hate goodbyes, don't you? I just go to pieces."
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,starlight glimmer,"Discord! What a... heh... nice surprise! This is your first time at our new school, isn't it?"
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,starlight glimmer,"Well, at least you're here now. Um, why are you here now?"
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,discord,"To fill in for Twilight, of course, as head-draconequus. I seem to recall a whole song about how this school is where you make your own rules. Now, who better at that than me?"
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,spike,Then you also must've heard Starlight is in charge now.
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,discord,Really? I thought there must be some mistake.
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,starlight glimmer,Nope. Twilight picked me for the job. And she left pretty detailed instructions for me to follow.
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,discord,"[writing] ""Item one <U+0096> Gravity is optional."""
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,starlight glimmer,Whoa-oa!
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,discord,"""Item two <U+0096> The school's new mascot is an ambidextrous marmoset."""
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,discord,"""Item three<U+0097>"""
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,starlight glimmer,"Not gonna happen. I promised Twilight I'd handle this her way. So thanks, but no thanks."
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,spike,"Uh-oh. When we play Ogres & Oubliettes and he puts that many E's in ""really"", the things don't usually end well."
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,starlight glimmer,"Don't worry, Spike. Discord and I are old ""save Equestria"" buddies. He'll be fine. Now, what's next on Twilight's list?"
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,spike,Okay. I hid the artifacts for the Spell-venger Hunt and ordered school supplies for the week. All you have to worry about is teaching class.
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,starlight glimmer,"[sighs] Thanks, Spike. Maybe we will get through this okay."
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,spike,Twittermites?
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,spike,Ow!
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,starlight glimmer,Discord! What are you doing?!
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,starlight glimmer,"[gags] We'll take it from here, Discord. Go relax. Have a cup of tea. At home."
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,discord,Oh! Some thanks for all my help. And after I hired all those substitute teachers for you.
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,spike,"Actually, that does sound kinda helpful. And it was next on our to-do list."
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,starlight glimmer,Which teachers did you hire?
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,iron will,"They call it ""making friends"", because you have to make creatures be your friends! Show me what you've got, yak!"
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,yona,"[clears throat, quietly] Be my friend."
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,iron will,"If you're quiet, I don't buy it!"
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,yona,[louder] Be my friend!
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,iron will,I've heard pudding that's more convincing!
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,yona,"[huffs, even louder] Be! My! Friend!"
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,starlight glimmer,[quietly] That's not how Twilight teaches friendship.
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,cranky doodle donkey,"Some field trip! Where's my iced tea?! [sips, gulps, spits] This is too cold! [sips, gulps, spits] Now it's too hot!"
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,cranky doodle donkey,"[sips, gulps, spits] Now it's too tea-flavored!"
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,cranky doodle donkey,You call yourselves friends?!
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,spike,That is definitely not how Twilight teaches friendship.
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,starlight glimmer,You hired a tree as a teacher?!
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,discord,Its schedule was free.
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,spike,"Uh, guys? That's not just any tree."
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,spike,[blows nose] It's a dragon-sneeze tree.
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,starlight glimmer,"W-W-W-Wait! Calm down, everycreature! It's gonna be okay!"
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,yona,[yells] BE MY FRIEEEEENNNND!
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,discord,"Mmmm, my, my, my. You do seem like you're in over your head. Won't Twilight be so disappointed with how you're ruining<U+0097>I mean, running her school?"
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,starlight glimmer,Discord!
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,starlight glimmer,This is all your fault!
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,discord,Mine? I thought you were in charge here. But I'm happy to pitch in if you need me.
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,starlight glimmer,What I need is for you to leave!
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,discord,Happy now?
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,spike,"Come on, Discord. You know that's not what she means."
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,discord,"Fine! From now on, I won't try to help. At! All!"
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,starlight glimmer,"[groans] Thanks, Spike. Let's just hope he stays gone."
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,spike,I wouldn't count on it. I think Discord's trying to test you.
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,starlight glimmer,But why? I thought we were friends.
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,spike,"Well, it's kinda what he does. Even to ponies or dragons he cares about."
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,starlight glimmer,"Oh, well, I'm ready for him. I told Twilight I'd run her school right, and I'm gonna keep that promise. No matter what."
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,starlight glimmer,"Good morning, students! I know there's been a little bit of adjustment since the professors left for their trip. But I've brought in new new teachers. And now everything should run smoothly. Now it's time for class. And don't forget, this afternoon is the Spell-venger Hunt!"
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,discord,"[California accent] Yo! Greetings, fellow creatures!"
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,discord,Is this seat taken?
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,trixie,"Welcome, class! You may call me the Great and Powerful Professor Trrrrrri<U+0097>"
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,discord,"Shhh! Really, that's so inconsiderate!"
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,discord,"Oh, I better take this. Hello?"
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,discord,"Oh, he did not! And what did you say?"
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,discord,[gasps] You did not!
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,trixie,Discord! Why are you here?!
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,discord,"Why, I'm a student of friendship, of course. Unless you don't think you're good enough to teach me."
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,trixie,Of course I am! No fruit calls in my class!
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,trixie,"Magic is the most important element of friendship. So, today I, the Great and Powerful Trixie, will put on a magic show!"
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,discord,[chuckles] I'm learning so much. Aren't you?
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,trixie,[growls] Discord!
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,trixie,"Eh, hello?"
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,trixie,"Um, what exactly is a long-distance plan?"
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,discord,"Take a lap, team!"
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,sandbar,"Uh, actually, we just finished Professor Spitfire's workout."
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,silverstream,"I've never run so fast in my life! Oh, this is great!"
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,sandbar,"[pants] Hey, coach, we need a break."
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,starlight glimmer,"Discord, that's enough! Endangering students crosses the line! I don't know why you're trying to ruin this school, but it stops now!"
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,discord,I wouldn't be so sure.
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,starlight glimmer,This is your last warning.
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,spike,"Hey-hey-hey! Take it easy, Starlight! Discord's your friend, remember?"
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,starlight glimmer,"Well, he's not acting like it!"
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,spike,"[huffs] She's right, Discord. What's your problem?"
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,discord,"My problem? How is the fact that Twilight decided to put an incompetent, power-hungry unicorn in charge of her school my problem?!"
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,starlight glimmer,[nervous laughter] Don't worry. I just banished him from school grounds forever. He's fine.
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,spike,That probably made things worse. Why didn't you just talk to Discord?
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,starlight glimmer,Because he's right about one thing. I've been doing a terrible job as headmare.
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,spike,"No, you haven't. Discord is just bein'... Discord."
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,starlight glimmer,Maybe. But I wonder why me being in charge bothers him so much.
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,spike,We can figure that out after the Spell-venger Hunt. C'mon!
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,starlight glimmer,"For this afternoon's Spell-venger Hunt, you'll need to use the artifacts' history to find where they're hidden in the castle. When you spot one, touch it with a magic shield to keep track of your score."
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,spike,Twilight left the list of your hunt partners before she left. I'll pass out the shields.
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,starlight glimmer,Ready... set... Spell-venger Hunt!
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,spike,C'mon! We can use Twilight's observatory to watch the teams!
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,smolder,I hope you know where you're going.
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,ocellus,To the Helm of Yksler!
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,smolder,"Eh, works for me."
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,ocellus,"In our book, it says Yksler was an honorable yak warrior. Any enemies that saw him put down their weapons in peace. I think his artifact must be in one of these suits of armor."
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,smolder,I'm guessing that one.
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,ocellus,"Yes! One down, five to go!"
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,starlight glimmer,"Awww, Ocellus and Smolder found their first artifact! Wait. What's that?"
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,ocellus,"Uh, I don't think that's part of the Spell-venger Hunt!"
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,ocellus,The school is haunted!
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,smolder,And not cool!
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,silverstream,We're totally gonna win this Spell-venger Hunt!
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,gallus,"Yeah, I doubt that. But at least I know where one of the artifacts is. Saw Spike hide it yesterday."
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,gallus,The Crown of Grover! Score!
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,gallus,"They say it's magic and King Grover used it to become the first ruler of Griffonstone. I know, pretty sweet, right?"
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,silverstream,You paid attention in class!
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,gallus,What?! I-If you ever tell an<U+0097>
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,gallus,Whoa!
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,silverstream,3D painting!
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,starlight glimmer,"Yup, that's definitely Discord. This is not good."
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,spike,I thought you banished him from the school.
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,starlight glimmer,"Only his body. Apparently, his ghost can come and go just fine. Let's go. We have to stop this."
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,spike,"How? No offense, but I don't think magic is the answer against Discord."
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,starlight glimmer,"This time, I'm not using magic."
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,yona,Hmm... What Yona look for?
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,sandbar,"The Shell of Knuckerbocker. It's like a seashell, but if you blow into it, you call a dragon! There's a sweet poem in our book about it. ""Climb to the heights with dragon flight."" [gasps] Like flight of stairs!"
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,yona,Yona take pony word for it.
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,yona,Huh?
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,sandbar,[grunts] What's happening?!
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,yona,Ugh! Yona not know! But Yona do know Yona not like Spell-venger Hunt!
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,ocellus,[yelps] Whoa!
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,starlight glimmer,"Everycreature, stop!"
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,silverstream,B-B-B-But the school is haunted!
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,starlight glimmer,It's not haunted. It's Discord.
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,spike,Detention.
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,starlight glimmer,"Discord, you can't keep messing up the school."
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,starlight glimmer,Then I have just one thing to say to you.
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,starlight glimmer,I'm sorry.
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,starlight glimmer,I had to stop thinking like a headmare and start thinking like a guidance counselor to finally understand. You felt left out.
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,discord,Uh... [stuttering] I don't know what you're getting at.
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,starlight glimmer,"Nopony ever invited you to the school. And when you offered to help, I didn't listen. I was so worried about doing things Twilight's way, I didn't stop to think about being a good friend. I'd like to apologize for that. And offer you the job of vice headmare."
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,spike,Huh?
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,silverstream,Really?!
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,gallus,What?!
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,ocellus,Why?!
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,yona,No!
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,smolder,Him?!
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,sandbar,Totally confused.
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,discord,"I accept! I mean, I-I-I suppose I can find some time in my busy schedule to help you out. But I will need my own office, expense account, parking space..."
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,spike,"You're new to the world of education, aren't you?"
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,starlight glimmer,"Next time you want something, just ask for it, all right?"
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,discord,But then we'd miss out on all those delightful misadventures.
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,spike,Hey! Watch the wings!
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,starlight glimmer,"Now, Vice Headmare Discord, if you'll help me get this Spell-venger Hunt back in order."
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,discord,[snaps fingers] Everything is re-hidden.
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,discord,"[chuckles] Well, with a few surprises."
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,twilight sparkle,Discord! I can't believe you tricked us into going on a friendship quest that wasn't real!
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,discord,"Oh, back so soon?"
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,rarity,A glamour spell on our cutie marks?
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,rainbow dash,A fake summons from the map?
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,pinkie pie,"Hey, at least we got to go spelunking in that really creepy cave with all those eyeless worm creatures chasing us."
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,yona,"Oh, Yona so glad ponies back!"
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,applejack,"Uh, y'all get the feelin' we missed somethin'?"
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,twilight sparkle,"Thanks for taking care of the school, Starlight."
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,starlight glimmer,It was a challenge. Heh. But I think things turned out just the way you'd have handled them.
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,spike,[to Discord] Guess this means you're not vice headmare anymore.
A Matter of Principals,Nicole Dubuc,discord,"Oh, poo! I just ordered business cards!"
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,sandbar,Ponies' voices fill the night Hearth's Warming Eve is here once again
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,sandbar,"La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la La-la, la-la, la-la, la-la"
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,ocellus,[hesitantly] La-la-la-la... la...
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,yona,"Not everycreature celebrate same way, you know."
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,smolder,Yeah. Dragons don't do pony holidays.
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,spike,Sure we do! I love Hearth's Warming Eve! It's all about friends and presents and family and... presents!
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,twilight sparkle,"It's also about putting aside differences to come together, like the Earth ponies, Pegasi, and unicorns did on the first holiday."
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,ocellus,Oh! Is that why you put their Fire of Friendship on top of the tree? To help us remember their unity?
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,rainbow dash,And 'cause it looks cool.
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,silverstream,This is my favorite day of the year! [giggles] Not that I don't like the other ones. Tuesdays are great!
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,yona,Yona like any day that is start of winter break.
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,gallus,Two whole weeks without classes. How will Ocellus survive?
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,twilight sparkle,"I think you'll all enjoy the time off to be home with your families. To celebrate your own traditions. Attention, everycreature! School is officially out! Happy holidays, and we'll see you after the break!"
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,twilight sparkle,And for those of you traveling outside Equestria...
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,rainbow dash,"Yeah, shouldn't you guys be getting ready to go? If you miss that train, it's a really long walk."
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,twilight sparkle,"Go pack up, and we'll take you to the station."
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,spike,"It's that new bowtie I wanted, isn't it?"
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,twilight sparkle,You'll have to wait and see.
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,spike,"I'm waiting! But in the meantime, I'm shaking!"
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,spike,Wha... What happened?!
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,twilight sparkle,Everything's ruined <U+0096> that's what's happened!
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,rainbow dash,And I don't think it was an accident. Somepony was up here!
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,spike,Over there!
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,twilight sparkle,Outside!
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,spike,That's the students' quarters!
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,rainbow dash,"Might as well give up, whoever you are! We got ya cornered!"
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,twilight sparkle,Hello? Is anypony there?
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,rainbow dash,I'll check the back door!
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,silverstream,What's happening? [gasps] Another decorating party?
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,twilight sparkle,Has anycreature come in here?
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,smolder,"Well, yeah. All of us did. To pack? Like you told us to?"
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,spike,After that. Did you hear anything?
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,gallus,What's up?
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,yona,Yona done packing!
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,ocellus,Is something wrong?
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,rainbow dash,[grunts] The back door's locked! No way out!
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,twilight sparkle,But whoever did it had to have come in here! We saw them!
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,ocellus,Whoever did what?
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,sandbar,Whoa... That is so not cool.
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,spike,"And whoever did it ran into your rooms. No one came out, and all of you are still here."
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,rainbow dash,One of you must have done this! But... why would any of you want to sabotage Hearth's Warming Eve?
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,yona,Ugh! Yak not do this! Yona offended by accusation!
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,twilight sparkle,"We don't know what happened. Maybe this wasn't even on purpose. But I want to give whoever caused this mess a chance to tell the truth and explain themselves. I'll make it easy for you. Close your eyes. Now, if you did this, raise your hoof. Or claw. Or whatever."
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,twilight sparkle,"[sighs] Come on, Spike. Looks like we have to<U+0097> Spike, you can open your eyes."
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,spike,What? Oh!
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,rainbow dash,"Uh, what about me?"
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,twilight sparkle,You all can.
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,twilight sparkle,"But since nocreature took responsibility for this mess, you're all gonna have to help clean it up before you can go home."
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,smolder,Why do I have to stay?!
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,sandbar,"Aw, but the holidays!"
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,twilight sparkle,"While you're cleaning, we'll bring you into my office one at a time. Since honesty is one of the Elements of Harmony, we want to give you each a chance to tell us the truth."
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,rainbow dash,"And once we find out who did it, just you wait! We're gonna...! We'll...! What are we gonna do exactly?"
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,twilight sparkle,[sighs] The guilty party won't be going home over Hearth's Warming break. She or he will stay here for some one-on-one friendship lessons.
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,silverstream,But what if none of us confesses?
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,twilight sparkle,Then... [sighs] I guess there's no holidays for anycreature. You'll all stay over the break.
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,twilight sparkle,"All right, let's get to the bottom of this. Who wants to be interviewed first?"
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,gallus,Eh. I'll go. Beats mop duty.
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,silverstream,"Hey, I know! We can make a game out of this! See who finishes cleaning up first!"
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,smolder,Let's save time and cut to the chase. Which one of you did it?
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,ocellus,I would never do something this horrible! I love Hearth's Warming Eve! And I do not want to miss going home for it.
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,sandbar,Huh. I didn't even know changelings celebrated Hearth's Warming.
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,ocellus,"Oh, yes! It's our favorite holiday! Well, since Headmare Twilight shared it with us last year. She gave our hive very clear instructions."
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,ocellus,"[clears throat, reading] ""Welcome to the traditions and fun of Hearth's Warming! Here's a guide to help you enjoy this celebration of pony history. Families start the holidays by putting the tree up!"""
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,ocellus,"[reading] ""Thirsty? Dive into some holiday punch!"""
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,ocellus,"[reading] ""Just before bed, everypony exchanges gifts."""
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,ocellus,It doesn't say how long we keep doing this.
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,ocellus,"[reading] ""And to finish celebrating, you can build a fire, light it up, and sing carols."""
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,sandbar,You might have misunderstood things just a little.
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,ocellus,Eh. We may not have done everything exactly the way you do. But we made our own traditions! And I can't wait to do it all again this year!
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,smolder,If we ever get out of here.
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,twilight sparkle,Ocellus? Your turn.
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,silverstream,What happened?
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,gallus,What do you think happened? I told her I didn't do it.
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,yona,Ugh! Yona tired of waiting! Yaks always home for holidays!
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,sandbar,"How do you celebrate Hearth's Warming in Yakyakistan, Yona?"
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,yona,"Yaks do not. Our holiday much better. Is called Snilldar Fest. Night before, yaks gather things to smash and put them in big pile. Then in morning, we smash them! In afternoon, we smash them again! In evening<U+0097>"
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,gallus,"So it's just about smashing stuff, like all your other holidays."
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,yona,"No! How griffon get that idea? This holiday about so much more. Last year, for example. Most perfect Snilldar ever."
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,yona,"[voiceover] Whole family <U+0096> grandpa, grandma yak, Yona's brother, sister, mother, father yak <U+0096> all go to woods singing yak song."
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,yona,[voiceover] Calves in family pick out perfect smashing log. Then yaks smash it!
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,yona,[voiceover] Then yak family build perfect snow fort... and smash it!
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,yona,[voiceover] Then we hang perfect things on perfect moss pile and<U+0097>
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,yona,"What you think yaks are, barbarians? Moss pile is for special family rituals. Last year, ritual for Yona."
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,yona,[voiceover] All yak family gather around Yona and braid Yona hair for first time.
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,gallus,"So, to recap... Your holiday is about smashing things and family."
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,silverstream,"Happy Snilldar to you too, Yona! It's so cool to learn new traditions from new friends!"
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,smolder,"Yeah, well, one of these new friends has gotten us all in trouble. And they'd better confess soon."
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,ocellus,"Sandbar? Sorry, but they said they want you to go in next."
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,silverstream,"Why the rush to get home, Smolder? Like you said, dragons don't really have holidays, do they?"
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,smolder,Meh.
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,ocellus,[gasps] That's so sad! You must do something in the winter for fun.
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,smolder,"Well, we do have the Feast of Fire. Everydragon gets together and tells stories. The best one wins a pile of gemstones."
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,yona,"Ooh, what story won last year?"
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,smolder,"It was called ""A Dream Come True""."
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,silverstream,"Come on, now you've gotta tell it!"
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,smolder,"Ugh, fine. Once upon a time, there was this sad little dragon."
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,smolder,[narrating] Her name was Scales. She lived alone in the wilderness with nothing to eat.
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,smolder,"[narrating] But one night, as she sat alone in a storm, she heard something. It was the Dragon Lord! Scales was scared, but the Dragon Lord told her not to be afraid, that he was taking her to the Dragon Lands for a great feast."
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,smolder,"[narrating] Scales sat with the Dragon Lord's family and friends and had the biggest, best dinner of gemstones she'd ever eaten! Then, while the dragons were telling stories, Scales thought it would be so easy to seize power from this feeble and sensitive Dragon Lord. She saw her chance... and took it!"
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,smolder,"[narrating] She claimed the Bloodstone Scepter and took over the Dragon Lands! [as Scales, evil laughter] And forced the Dragon Lord to live out in the cold, just as she used to!"
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,ocellus,That's a horrible story!
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,smolder,"Maybe to you. But dragons like hearing about weak, kind creatures getting defeated."
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,rainbow dash,Silverstream! You're up! Let's go!
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,smolder,"So, did you tell them you did it?"
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,sandbar,What?! No way! Why would I say that?
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,smolder,You already live in Ponyville. Staying here over break is no big deal.
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,yona,School of Friendship good place for pony to have pony holiday.
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,sandbar,I'd still rather spend it with my family at home. Oh! That reminds me! I have the best holiday story ever! It's called...
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,sandbar,"[voiceover] ""The Day My Hearth's Warming Doll Almost Fell into the Fire!"""
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,sandbar,"[voiceover] Just before we went to bed, my mom, my dad, and my sister all put our Hearth's Warming Dolls up on the mantel, just like we do every year. But this year, I put my doll too close to the edge, and it fell!"
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,sandbar,[in slow motion] Nooooooo!
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,ocellus,[gasps] And?!
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,sandbar,My doll hit the floor. But it could have gone in the fire!
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,smolder,[sarcastic] That's a great story. And you told it really well.
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,sandbar,Yeah. It was a Hearth's Warming miracle.
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,rainbow dash,"Next! Smolder, come with me. Yona, Twilight's waiting for you."
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,ocellus,"The last two. So if neither one of them confesses, that means..."
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,silverstream,We're never going home!
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,ocellus,We'll be here forever!
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,sandbar,Beyond forever.
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,silverstream,But I can't miss the Three Days of Freedom Celebration!
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,gallus,[sarcastic] How long does that last?
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,silverstream,"It used to be only one day, but now to commemorate our escape from the Storm King, we're adding two more days of awesome! See?"
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,gallus,There's a book?
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,silverstream,Mm-hmm! Queen Novo had these made for the Mount Aris board of tourism to explain it all to guests!
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,silverstream,"[voiceover] We'll spend the first night in Seaquestria, thanking the ocean for protecting us from the Storm King. Sea-dancing, whale-singing, shell-stringing... Lots of ""ing""'s."
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,silverstream,"[voiceover] The second day will be on Mount Aris, with sky-dancing and a wind song in the Harmonizing Heights to celebrate the Storm King's defeat. Then the third day, everycreature will party together, on land and sea! Grandparents and parents and sisters, uncles, brothers, acquaintances, neighbors, and cousins. And at the end of the night, Queen Novo is gonna give out presents!"
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,gallus,"Wait. Hold on. ""Cousins""? What are those?"
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,ocellus,"Your aunts and uncles' children. You know, part of your family. Heh. Oh. You're teasing us again, right?"
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,sandbar,I'm guessing neither one of you confessed.
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,yona,[sighs] Headmare Twilight say wait here.
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,silverstream,Maybe they're changing their minds about sending us home.
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,smolder,Why would they? Face it. We're stuck here.
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,ocellus,[sniffles] But-but-but I have to go home!
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,silverstream,My mom makes the best kelp fritters.
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,sandbar,How can you be so cool about this?
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,smolder,We're mad. We just show it differently.
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,sandbar,More like you don't show it at all.
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,yona,What pony getting at?
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,silverstream,Maybe it wasn't just one prankster. Maybe there were three of you. And you're trying to hide your guilt by not being upset!
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,ocellus,It does make sense.
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,gallus,"Guys, stop it."
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,smolder,Or maybe whoever did it is only pretending to be upset to throw us off.
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,ocellus,Me?! But I didn't!
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,gallus,"Come on, let it go."
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,sandbar,"Come on! Ocellus, you know you did it! Just fess up!"
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,gallus,"I said, stop fighting! That's not what the holidays are about! No matter what you call them or how you celebrate! D-Do you know how lucky you all are? With your stories about sharing and-and kindness and getting together with everycreature that you care about?"
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,ocellus,"But griffons do that too, don't they?"
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,smolder,Some holiday about a moon?
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,gallus,"[sighs] Blue Moon Festival. The one time of year when griffons are nice to each other. Well, as nice as we can be."
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,gallus,[voiceover] Families get together to eat and then complain about the food and give each other presents they don't like and mostly just try not to yell at each other.
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,silverstream,"Well, at least you get to be with your family."
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,gallus,No... because I don't have a family.
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,sandbar,[voiceover] What about Grampa Gruff?
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,gallus,[voiceover] That's just his name. He's not anygriff's actual grandpa. I felt like I never had a place in Griffonstone.
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,gallus,"Then I came here and, well, met all of you. So I don't want to go home for the break. And that's why... I did it!"
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,yona,[gasps] Griffon mess up decorations?!
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,gallus,Yeah. It was me. I put goo powder in the Fire of Friendship.
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,sandbar,So it wasn't Ocellus?
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,ocellus,Why would you ruin things for us?
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,gallus,"I didn't plan to! I just figured if I made a mess, our teachers would make us stay to clean up. We'd be together a little longer."
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,smolder,"Well, it worked, didn't it?"
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,gallus,"Better than I thought. And when Headmare Twilight threatened to cancel winter break, that meant I would get to be with all of you through the entire holiday. That's why I didn't confess."
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,sandbar,"So, why are you admitting this now?"
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,gallus,"I hated seeing all you fighting and-and blaming each other. That's the opposite of what all your holidays mean. Except maybe yours, Smolder. I can't keep all of you from the happiness of your homes and families just because I feel bad. I'm sorry. Don't worry. You won't have to tell our teachers. I will."
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,twilight sparkle,You don't have to. We already know.
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,rainbow dash,We kinda guessed it was you. But we wanted to give you the chance to tell the truth.
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,twilight sparkle,"I'm proud that you did, and I'm glad to see you've been paying attention in Professor Applejack's honesty classes. But you're still going to have to make amends and stay over break for extra friendship lessons by yourself."
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,silverstream,I'll stay with him.
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,ocellus,"Me, too!"
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,yona,Yona stay also!
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,sandbar,I'm staying!
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,smolder,What? All right. I guess pony holidays can't be that bad.
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,sandbar,Now you can finally know what it's like to spend Hearth's Warming with friends who care about you.
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,rainbow dash,"[whispering, to Twilight Sparkle] Looks like they don't really need any extra lessons."
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,twilight sparkle,"Since you obviously know that Hearth's Warming is about coming together, I'd be honored if all of you would join my friends as guests at our holiday table."
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,twilight sparkle,After we finish cleaning up.
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,sandbar,"Hey, this reminds me of another story! ""The Time I Almost Spilled Grape Juice on the White Couch""!"
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,smolder,Does it have a depressing ending?
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,ocellus,I'm not sure pony stories work that way.
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,yona,Gallus want Yona braid feathers?
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,gallus,Uhhh... pass.
The Hearth's Warming Club,Brian Hohlfeld,silverstream,Hearth's Warming Eve is here once again!
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",star swirl the bearded,"[voiceover] Dear Twilight, it is difficult to express how grateful I am to you for teaching me the power of friendship."
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",star swirl the bearded,"[voiceover] You would think after more than a thousand years, there would be nothing left to learn."
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",star swirl the bearded,"[voiceover] And yet, even a pony as old as I can continue to be surprised by how much there is to know."
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",twilight sparkle,"[reading] ""I hope you find these postcards enjoyable, and I look forward to seeing you again, though I can't say when my journey will be complete. Your friend, Star Swirl."
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",rarity,It must be gratifying to have your idol writing to you about the friendship lessons he's learning.
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",twilight sparkle,"I'm not sure I'll ever get used to it. Of course, if he really wants to learn about friendship, he could just come to our school."
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",cozy glow,"Professor Sparkle? The mailpony just came with, uh, a few things."
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",rarity,Ooh! The sewing machines I ordered for my class!
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",cozy glow,"These came, too. I wasn't sure what to make of them."
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",rarity,"These machines were costly, but I am quite certain the friendship lessons I can teach my students with them will be invaluable."
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",rarity,"Oh, don't worry, darling. I'll think of something. And I didn't use the school funds to buy these. I made the purchase entirely with my own bits."
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",twilight sparkle,It's not that. It's this!
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",rarity,"[reading] ""Why waste your time at a friendship school that's just a school? Learn everything they teach and more at Friendship University""?!"
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",twilight sparkle,Who would open another friendship school?
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",rarity,"Oh, pfft! I'm sure it's nothing to worry about. You're the Princess of Friendship. What could this other school possibly offer?"
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",smolder,It isn't just another friendship school. It's a university!
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",ocellus,It says they teach the same lessons of competing schools in half the time. That's twice the learning!
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",gallus,And it's in Las Pegasus? If Professor Rarity lets us skip her sewing class <U+0096> road trip!
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",rarity,I think we need to look into this school.
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",rarity,I don't like to judge solely on appearances. But... what kind of friendship school is this?
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",twilight sparkle,There's more ponies in here than at our whole school. Who is running this place?
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",flim,"[echoing] Welcome, friends! You are about to embark on a journey of amazing magnitude! One that will change your lives forever!"
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",flam,[echoing] Prepare yourselves to embrace a new path and become students of...
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",twilight sparkle,Flim and Flam. Of course.
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",flim,If you're alone and you can't make friends We understand your plight
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",flam,"Until now, there was just one way Your friendships could take flight"
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",flim,"There is a school real far away That'll teach you what to know But if you live here, you couldn't stay"
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",flam,You'd learn you have to go-o-o-o
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",flim,"Now, there is an alternative to all of that adversity"
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",flam,"Not just a school, I'll have you know"
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",flim,"That's it, everypony, you heard correct!"
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",flam,"Friendship U, the one and only university of friendship!"
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",flim,"As you can see, we're a success By any kind of stat"
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",twilight sparkle,"That may be so, for all I know But I still smell a rat"
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",flam,"Everypony, lookie here That other school's headmare"
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",flim,Her presence is a testament To the mutual respect...
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",twilight sparkle,"What?! No, it isn't!"
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",flam,It really is the final piece To make our work complete
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",flim,To have the Friendship Princess Bless our school is such a treat
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",flam,We're so honored!
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",twilight sparkle,How can anypony learn friendship in half the time?
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",flam,"Our coursework is so accelerated, to take longer would be a crime!"
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",flim,The lessons that we teach have been Reviewed and checked and edited
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",flam,Which might explain why our new school's
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",flim,"That's it, everypony! Let's hear it! Tell us again why it's the best!"
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",twilight sparkle,Accredited?
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",flam,It means officially recognized or authorized.
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",rarity,We know what it means. But who would accredit this place?
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",chancellor neighsay,"Why, the EEA, of course."
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",twilight sparkle,Chancellor Neighsay?!
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",chancellor neighsay,The Equestria Educational Association has taken an interest in institutions that teach friendship in a pony-first environment. Surely you didn't think your school has a monopoly on the concept?
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",rarity,"Well, she did write the book on it."
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",chancellor neighsay,"Ah, yes. How to teach friendship to creatures who will one day use it as a weapon against us."
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",twilight sparkle,How could they use friendship as a weapon?!
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",chancellor neighsay,"You tell me. It's your book. Meantime, this university appears to be a promising option for ponies who'd prefer to stick to the EEA book on the subject."
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",twilight sparkle,You can't be serious. They're obviously up to something. It's Flim and Flam!
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",flim,"[gasps] Well, that certainly wasn't friendly."
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",chancellor neighsay,One would think the headmare of a school of friendship <U+0096> albeit an unaccredited one <U+0096> would behave differently. Unless she was trying to undermine the competition? Hmm?
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",twilight sparkle,I<U+0097> No! What?! I-I am not!
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",flam,"Now, now, fillies and gentlecolts. Let's show the princess just how friendly we are by signing up for some classes!"
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",flim,Why don't I show you around?
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",twilight sparkle,"I'm sorry, but approval from the EEA won't convince me that this school is what you promise."
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",flim,And what would it take to convince you?
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",twilight sparkle,"Well, somepony whose opinion I respect, for one."
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",flim,Really? Somepony like... this?
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",star swirl the bearded,Twilight?
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",rarity,Uh-oh.
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",twilight sparkle,Star Swirl? What are you doing here?
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",star swirl the bearded,"Why, studying friendship at Flim and Flam's wonderful school!"
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",rarity,"Oh, please. I think I know a disguise when I see one. Take off that ridiculous beard... Flam!"
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",flam,How's it going in here?
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",star swirl the bearded,[groans] It-It's really me.
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",chancellor neighsay,"I'd heard rumors you've returned, but I didn't believe it until now. And if a pony of your stature is studying here, there really isn't anything else I need to see. I, Chancellor Neighsay, hereby confer upon Friendship University complete and unreserved EEA accreditation!"
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",twilight sparkle,I... I don't understand. Why would you come here and not my school?
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",star swirl the bearded,"My travels brought me to Las Pegasus. I didn't come for the school, but Flim and Flam convinced me to try it out."
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",twilight sparkle,You can't trust Flim and Flam! They tried to con the Apples out of their farm! They sold fake health tonic! They run a resort in Las Pegasus!
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",flam,"Technically, our resort is a legitimate business."
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",star swirl the bearded,"I spent a thousand years thinking the worst of a ""bad"" pony. You taught me to look for the best in him. Whatever Flim and Flam's past may be, starting this school shows they want to change for the better."
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",twilight sparkle,I wish I could believe that.
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",star swirl the bearded,"Besides, what's untrustworthy about opening a school of friendship? They don't even charge for classes."
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",twilight sparkle,"I don't know. But I know they're up to something. And until I find out, I'm begging you, come to my school instead."
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",chancellor neighsay,"I understand feeling threatened by competition, but my word, Princess. I wonder if the ill manners of the creatures at your school aren't contagious. I think I will take my leave before I become infected."
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",star swirl the bearded,"Twilight, I promise I'll visit your school soon. But for now, perhaps it's best if you return there."
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",twilight sparkle,"You don't think they're running an actual friendship school, do you?"
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",rarity,"Darling, of course not. Which is why we have to investigate!"
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",twilight sparkle,"But we can't go poking around the school. Everypony'll think I'm still just ""threatened by the competition""."
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",rarity,Only if we do it as ourselves.
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",rarity,"In these disguises, we could pass as students at out own school."
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",twilight sparkle,"[muffled] I don't know, Rarity."
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",rarity,Ah-ah. What did I say about using our real names?
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",twilight sparkle,"Sorry, ""Plainity"". But I'm pretty sure this isn't enough of a disguise."
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",rarity,[blows bubblegum] We sure are. Completely new.
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",rarity,"[squeals] Now, I've read enough Shadow Spade to know the key to going undercover is rehearsing your backstory. [clears threat, in affected voice] I'm ""Plainity"". and I love bland old normal stuff. No frills for me. [normal voice] Okay! Your turn."
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",twilight sparkle,[groans] My name's Eyepatch. I have an eye patch.
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",rarity,"Perfect! Now, how do we start our investigation?"
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",twilight sparkle,"I think we should split up. You enroll in some classes and find out what they're actually teaching. I'll look around and see what I can find, assuming I'm not recognized."
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",flam,"Welcome, newest students! Let's dive right in, shall we? One of the most important elements of friendship is being thoughtful. True or false?"
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",rarity,"If by ""thoughtful"" you mean ""generous"", I'd say true."
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",flam,"Correct! [laughs] It was a trick question. Very impressive, Miss...?"
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",rarity,Plainity.
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",flam,"Well, well, well, Miss Plainity, keep it up and you'll be ready for our next level in no time!"
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",flam,"Now, let's see if you can demonstrate for the class. What's something generous you could do for... me right now?"
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",flam,"Class, Plainity here is now my star pupil. If any of you want a chance at studying with Star Swirl, I'd take notes on her every action."
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",twilight sparkle,"Hello? The door is open, so I'll just assume it's okay to come in and look around. Unless somepony says it's not. All right, then."
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",twilight sparkle,"[reading] ""The Element of Laughter and its applications."" Okay, that seems pretty genuine. ""When to support your friends' decisions and when to talk sense."" Huh. That's actually kind of interesting. Aha! ""Friendship University's true goal... is to help friends become better friends""? [groans] Where is the proof that it's all a scam?"
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",flam,There isn't any!
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",flim,Twilight Sparkle! Did you really think an eye patch was enough of a disguise?
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",twilight sparkle,"No, I didn't!"
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",flam,"Well, then we agree that everypony will recognize the Princess of Friendship in this photo of you sneaking into our office."
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",flim,"I can see the headline now! ""Princess of Jealousy! Twilight Sparkle Bent on Ruining Her Competition!"""
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",flam,So sad. A news story like that would destroy your reputation. Nopony will want to go to your school after that.
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",flam,Just wait until the papers get a hold of this!
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",flim,"""Princess Unhinged!"" It'll be the talk of Equestria!"
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",star swirl the bearded,"Well, gentleponies, I've finished another stack. The lessons in these worksheets are quite fascinating. Twilight? What's going on here?"
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",flim,"Oh, just your prot<e9>g<e9> getting caught snooping in our office in disguise! Well, sort of."
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",flam,"Oh, honestly, Princess Twilight, envy does not look good on you."
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",twilight sparkle,I'm not envious! I know these two are up to something. I'm just trying to find out what.
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",star swirl the bearded,"The only pony I see who is up to something is the pony in this picture, and it is not the princess I know."
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",flim,"Well, it's about to be the princess all of Equestria knows."
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",flam,"Unless... you decided to drop the whole ""uncover the scam"" thing."
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",flim,Then we'll rip this silly picture up and not let it completely and utterly ruin you and your school.
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",rarity,"You can be generous with all sorts of things. Gifts, compliments, your time."
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",rarity,"Hey, Eyepatch! Where's your eye patch? [gasps] Was your cover blown?"
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",twilight sparkle,You could say that. Flim and Flam took a picture of me sneaking into their office.
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",rarity,Were we wearing our eye patch?
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",twilight sparkle,"If I don't stop investigating, they're going to tell everypony that I'm trying to sabotage their school because I'm jealous."
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",rarity,But-But-But that's ridiculous!
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",twilight sparkle,I don't know. Maybe I am just upset that Star Swirl came here instead of my school. Flim and Flam may have turned over a new leaf. We should probably just go home.
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",rarity,"Twilight, you are not the kind of pony to let your emotions cloud your judgment. If you think Flim and Flam are up to no good, you can't give up, even if their lessons really are impressive."
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",twilight sparkle,"Wait, what?!"
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",twilight sparkle,Flim and Flam are charging for these?
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",rarity,"Well, they have to cover expenses, and Flam insists that everything extra goes to improving the school and<U+0097>"
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",rarity,"This is the scam, isn't it?"
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",twilight sparkle,Let's find out.
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",star swirl the bearded,These lessons are so valuable. Are you sure I can't give you more?
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",flam,"Ah-ah-ah! Unnecessary! Being able to share them with a pony like you is our real reward. [to Destitute Pony] Oh, my. And you want to study alongside Star Swirl, hmm?"
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",flim,Come back for the rest when you can afford it.
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",flam,"And that's the kind of determination that'll get you to the next level, student whose... name I know!"
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",rarity,"[whispering] Twilight, maybe I should take over the investigation. Think of your reputation!"
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",twilight sparkle,"My reputation isn't worth much if I won't risk it for what I think is right. Besides, I have a plan."
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",flim,"Well, brother of mine, we've got almost all the bits we need to expand our resort. If we add another level of classes and worksheets, we'll be there."
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",flam,"Maybe we should add two levels, just to be safe."
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",flim,[sighs] It's a thing of beauty. But I was thinking. What if we added another extreme pool slide here?
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",flam,"Mmmm... Sure, as long as the pipes for the musical chocolate fountain go through... here."
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",twilight sparkle,But shouldn't it go closer to the pudding hot tub here?
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",flim,"Fair point, but<U+0097> What?!"
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",twilight sparkle,I knew your school was a scam!
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",flim,"Well, well, well, if it isn't the Princess of Jealousy. I guess we'll be going to the papers after all."
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",twilight sparkle,And I suppose I'll just lead your students into this secret room of bits and resort expansion plans!
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",flam,Uhhhh... l-let's not get hasty. You have something on us. We have something on you. Let's just call it even.
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",twilight sparkle,"I don't think so. You can destroy my reputation if you want, but using your students' bits to expand your resort is wrong, even if the lessons you teach are good ones."
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",flam,Of course they're good. We copied them from your book.
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",flim,"We just skipped every other page. All the lessons, half the time!"
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",twilight sparkle,"[groans] Fine. If you really want to call it even, give back the bits and stop charging for my lessons. Then you can teach them as much as you like."
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",flim,"Running a school is more work than we thought. Besides, we almost have everything we need."
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",rarity,I think not!
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",flam,Plainity? My star pupil?
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",rarity,"[affected voice] Not Plainity, but... [normal voice] Rarity!"
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",flim,Who?
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",rarity,We decided to bring somepony else here to listen to everything you just said!
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",flim,"[stutters] Hey, Star Swirl. We were just about to<U+0097>"
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",star swirl the bearded,Return the bits you've collected from your students and close your school?
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",flam,[gulps] Yeah. That.
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",star swirl the bearded,"[sighs] It seems I'll never stop learning from your example, Twilight. It is a valuable lesson to stand up for what you know is true. I wish I had known it, too."
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",star swirl the bearded,"Well, I can refer you to a fairly reputable establishment just outside of Ponyville. I'm quite certain the headmare would consider letting you in."
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",twilight sparkle,"[reading] ""Of course, if I ever go to a school again, I'll make sure it's yours. In friendship, Star Swirl."""
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",rarity,I still don't understand how Flim and Flam could have gotten a copy of your book.
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",cozy glow,"Uh, I finished straightening up in the library. Professor Rarity, I just wanted to make sure you're definitely keeping these."
Friendship University,"Chris ""Doc"" Wyatt & Kevin Burke",rarity,"But of course, darling. If there's one thing I learned at Friendship University, it is not to give up when you know what's right. And I know teaching friendship through sewing is right! I just need to figure out how."
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,starlight glimmer,Oh! Rarity! Just the pony I'm looking for! Can you come to Twilight's class with me? It won't take long.
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,rarity,"Oh, I'd love to help, but I have to meet Rainbow Dash for our day of fun together."
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,starlight glimmer,Twilight wants to use you as an example for the students.
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,rarity,Ooh!
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,rarity,Your example is here! [laughs] Oh!
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,I thought I was the example.
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,twilight sparkle,"You both are. Because together, you perfectly demonstrate my lesson on compromise in friendship. Rainbow Dash and Rarity have very different interests that keep them busy. But being friends is so important to them, they always manage to make time for each other."
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,rarity,"[laughs nervously] Our day of fun was hard to plan, what with Rainbow Dash's extremely time-consuming and erratically scheduled Wonderbolts practice."
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,"And Rarity's weird fashion seasons. She's working on her winter collection, and it's not even summer yet!"
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,twilight sparkle,"But you still found time to be together, and that's what counts. See, class? These ponies are models of true friendship in action."
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,twilight sparkle,Thanks for stopping by! Enjoy your day of fun!
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,silverstream,Ooh! Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh! What amazing stuff are you gonna do together?!
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,"Aw, come on! I even said ""shopping"" that time!"
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,rarity,Perfect! We'll go shopping first.
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,But I brought stuff for buckball to<U+0097>
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,smolder,Are we supposed to be learning something here? 'Cause this doesn't sound like compromising at all.
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,gallus,"Yeah, you guys have nothing in common. How can you be friends?"
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,twilight sparkle,"Even though Rainbow Dash and Rarity enjoy doing different things, there are plenty of reasons why they're friends."
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,yona,"Uh, like what?"
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,[scoffs] We've always been friends.
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,ocellus,Always?
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,"Well, no. Not always. But for like a super long time."
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,rarity,And we know all the same ponies.
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,smolder,"Um, is that it?"
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,"Uh, there was that time during the Cloudsdale Best Young Flyer Competition that I totally saved Rarity's life."
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,rarity,Yes! And I once proved Rainbow Dash's innocence to her beloved Wonderbolts when she was being framed for a mysterious incident.
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,sandbar,Cool! What else?
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,starlight glimmer,"Uh, look. It may seem like Rarity and Rainbow Dash don't have that much in common when you try to put it into words, but sometimes friendships can't be explained. You just have to see them in action to understand."
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,twilight sparkle,"Actually, that's a great idea!"
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,twilight sparkle,Just go about your day of fun as you normally would. You won't even know we're here!
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,[singsongy] Game on!
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,Rarity! You were supposed to be holding your bucket!
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,"Good! 'Cause this time, I'm gonna try something new and super-intense!"
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,Rarity! Are you even paying attention?!
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,rarity,"What? Oh! I mean, of course! Uh, I held my bucket and everything!"
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,But you have to catch the ball!
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,rarity,"Really? Well, that sounds dangerous."
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,"[quietly, to herself] Oh, forget it. She's never gonna understand the point of this game. [out loud] Buckball time is over!"
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,rarity,[sighs] Finally!
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,twilight sparkle,"Uhhh, see? They did something Rainbow Dash likes, so now it's time for something Rarity likes. Compromise!"
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,rarity,Hmmm... I'm genuinely not sure. Are they too in style?
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,"Uh, isn't that what you want them to be?"
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,rarity,"Oh, yes, yes. But they should be ahead of the curve. If they're in fashion right now, then they're practically already out."
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,That doesn't make any sense.
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,rarity,Hmmm... Perhaps I should get the stilettos instead. What do you think?
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,"[scoffs] Unless you like tripping with every step, heels on a horse are pretty useless."
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,rarity,"[nickers] Au contraire. They're perfect in a multitude of situations. Formal functions, afternoon teas, evening teas, high tea, tea by the sea, royal tea<U+0097>"
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,Can they clean up glitter? Ew! It's on my hooves! Are we done yet?! [groans] This is sooooo boring!
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,twilight sparkle,"Rainbow Dash and Rarity are just, uh, showcasing an aspect of friendship called ""banter"", the playful and friendly exchange of remarks. [laughs nervously] It's all in good fun."
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,rarity,"Ooh, I cannot wait! Collecting gemstones is my favorite!"
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,"Finally, something we can agree on! Treasure hunting!"
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,twilight sparkle,"See, everycreature? That didn't take long. Now they're having a great time together."
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,rarity,Ooh! Magnifique! This will be perfect for the emerald-encrusted romper I've been working on!
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,"Cool! Now, what would be even cooler is if we could find a treasure chamber or something! Now, if I were a secret door, where would I be?"
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,rarity,"Ugh, Rainbow Dash! Could you please refrain from all of that racket? It's muddying my concentration."
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,"[gasps] Look! A lever! [grunts] It's stuck! Come help me, Rarity!"
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,rarity,[sighs] Just a moment.
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,rarity,[gasps] You ruined my gems!
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,"Yeah, well, you ruined my treasure hunt!"
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,rarity,Ugh! This wasn't about treasure! It was about finding gemstones for my winter collection!
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,Who cares about clothes?! We're supposed to be on an adventure together!
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,twilight sparkle,Uh-oh.
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,rarity,"That... is... it! This ""day of fun"" is officially over!"
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,Fine by me! Maybe I can spend some time doing something I actually like now!
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,twilight sparkle,"[laughs nervously] Surely, you don't mean that. You're just having a little disagreement. [to students] Sometimes that happens between pals. But no matter what, they can always get past the problem and stay good friends."
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,I don't think we can. [to Rarity] You don't care about any of the things I like! It's always about you and your boring fashions!
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,rarity,"Oh, puh-lease! You don't even give my interests a chance! You have absolutely no respect for the finer things! No respect, I tell you!"
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,rarity,"...And then there was the time Rainbow Dash called my Cloudsdale Couture Boutique idea ""impractical""! Imagine that! Just because I needed Twilight to perform the butterfly wing spell on me whenever I wanted to deliver merchandise!"
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,...And I told her a thousand times Pegasi don't even want restrictive heavy dresses! We need to be able to fly! Duh!
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,rarity,"Not to mention the day I was wearing a really gorgeous hat, and Rainbow Dash didn't even notice!"
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,The Wonderbolts show was ruined! Rarity's hat was blocking everypony's view!
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,starlight glimmer,"Enough! Guidance counseling is for talking out your problems, not telling me everything that's ever happened in the history of Equestria! [groans] But I've learned sometimes talking isn't enough. You need to put yourselves in one another's shoes."
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,No way am I wearing those!
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,starlight glimmer,[groans] What I'm saying is we need a way to help you two reconnect. Follow me!
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,The library? And this helps us how?
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,starlight glimmer,"You both love books. Rainbow Dash never stops talking about Daring Do adventures, and you're a huge fan of Shadow Spade mysteries."
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,rarity,Your point?
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,starlight glimmer,"The perfect way for you two to reconnect as friends is to read each other's favorite book. I'll read them, too. Then we'll all discuss afterward. It'll be a ""Good Friends Book Club"". Okay? I'll bring snacks."
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,Ugh! Fine!
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,rarity,If you insist.
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,starlight glimmer,"Great! We're all here! To start, why don't you two share one thing you liked about each other's books?"
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,starlight glimmer,"Okay. I'll go first. Uh, I really enjoy the part in Daring Do and the Razor of Dreams when Daring used a vicious cragadile as a raft, and then<U+0097>"
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,rarity,[giggles] Please.
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,"Uh, what's so funny?"
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,rarity,"Oh, sorry. It's just that I find those action sequences so ridiculously over-the-top."
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,But they're real! You even met Daring Do!
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,rarity,"Yes, but the book's descriptions just drag on, and what about those silly unpronounceable names? Doctor whozit-whatsit... [Spanish pronunciation] Caballeron?"
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,starlight glimmer,"Uh, tea, anypony? Cucumber sandwich? [laughs nervously] Or we could go over some nice friendly talking points."
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,[scoffs] Seriously?! Don't even get me started on those clothing descriptions in Shadow Spade! What a yawn fest!
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,rarity,[stutters] But... the outfit descriptions are an integral part of the plot of The Colt in Crimson: A Shadow Spade Mystery!
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,rarity,"You see, if you didn't know that Sir Fluffingsworth von Radishfield wears only silk, double-breasted waistcoats, you'd never deduce that he, in fact, was the culprit!"
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,W-Wait. He was?
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,rarity,[gasps] You didn't even read it!
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,starlight glimmer,"[quietly, to herself] I can see I'm gonna need reinforcements."
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,Not my fault it's so boring and put me to sleep!
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,rarity,"If you can't be bothered to read the thing I like, that just further illustrates the point that we have nothing in common anymore!"
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,"At least we agree on that! From now on, I'm only hanging out with ponies who get me!"
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,starlight glimmer,Your drama can wait! Twilight needs help! Now!
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,starlight glimmer,[panting] Any luck?
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,twilight sparkle,No! It's goooone!
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,What's gone?
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,twilight sparkle,The Amulet of Aurora!
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,rarity,[gasps] One of the magical items you've been keeping for Princess Celestia?
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,twilight sparkle,"That amulet can reverse the tides and summon tsunamis! If it falls into the wrong hooves, Equestria will be in grave danger!"
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,"Don't worry, Twilight! I know tons about searching for lost treasure!"
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,rarity,"And if I follow the culprit's clues, I'm certain I can find who took your amulet!"
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,twilight sparkle,Thank you! I'll feel so much better knowing you two are looking for it together!
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,starlight glimmer,While we work on a locator spell. It's the perfect solution!
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,rarity,"There appear to be no signs of damage to the surrounding artifacts, suggesting the thief did not leave in a hurry."
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,"Rarity, your boots are leaving sparkles all over the floor!"
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,rarity,"Pfft! Those aren't from my boots. Mine are magenta, not blue. See?"
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,rarity,"I mean, really!"
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,rarity,"[panting] Turns out these boots were not ""made for trotting,"" as advertised. Where are you going?! We promised Twilight we'd work together!"
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,Don't you see? The Amulet of Aurora is made out of Azurantium!
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,"Azurantium? You know! The same metal that the Amulet of Atonement from Daring Do book four is made from? It always leaves sparkles wherever it goes. Just like this, remember? It's from the book you just read!"
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,rarity,[laughs nervously] That book! Yes! The one I-I just... just read! Ha-ha-ha!
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,"Seriously?! After giving me all that grief, you didn't read mine either?!"
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,rarity,Oopsie?
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,"[groans] As soon as we find this amulet, we are done with each other!"
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,rarity,Fine by me!
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,rarity,"[panting] Ooh! Rainbow Dash, slow down! You're flying past important clues! Look, it's a print. But definitely not a hoof. Are those claw marks?"
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,Who cares? I found a bigger clue!
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,rarity,I hope you don't expect me to... [shudders] ...wade through that.
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,Nah. It's too deep. We'll get stuck.
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,rarity,Ooh. Clever. What Daring Do book did you get that from?
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,"Actually, I learned it at Scootaloo's Filly Guides camp."
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,rarity,[sighs] At least you can fly across.
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,"[gasps, grunts] Nope. If one of those geysers burns off my wing feathers, I'll be out of the Wonderbolts for weeks. [groans] I could..."
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,"...try and slingshot my way through. But I'd need two perfectly placed trees, some stretchy rope, and a pith helmet. [groans] Too bad we can't do what Daring Do did in book four and find a cragadile for a raft."
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,rarity,"Ta-daaa! The S.S. Cragadile, at your service!"
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,"Uh, that... is... awesome! Uh, I mean, it's all right, I guess."
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,How did you know how to do that?
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,rarity,"Mmm. We may have been friends for a super-long time, but you don't know everything about me yet."
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,rarity,[gasps] The glitter trail! It's gone!
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,How are we supposed to find the Amulet of Aurora now?
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,rarity,[loudly] Sorry! What did you say?!
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,I think it's a Bufogren. They have really sensitive ears. [whispering loudly] Did you happen to see anycreature with a sparkly thingy go this way?
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,"His breath smells so bad, I can't think! But we can't hear him from back here. Now what?"
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,rarity,"Hmmm... [sniffs] Aha! I think I have the perfect solution. An old unicorn beauty trick. That is, if you can somehow procure us a tiny bit of cloud?"
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,Now that I can do!
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,rarity,"Ooh! It's adorable! [nose pinched] Um, excuse me, kind sir. I have a special treat for you in exchange for your information."
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,rarity,"Sorry, sorry. Enjoy."
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,rarity,"[sniffs, sighs]  Good. Uh, now, which way did the sparkly thing go?"
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,rarity,"Thank you! [to Rainbow Dash] Well, what are you waiting for? Go on! Fly up there and get that amulet!"
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,"Uh, we're doing this together, remember?"
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,"Sorry, but I wasn't leaving you behind in that swamp."
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,rarity,[exhales] Thank you.
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,Huh. Maybe the key to unlocking this thing is in these inscriptions.
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,rarity,Or perhaps the key is right here!
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,rarity,"I couldn't decide between the boots and the stilettos, so I got both!"
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,High heels could do that?
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,rarity,"And you called them ""useless""."
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,[sighs] I shouldn't have said that. Or made fun of the other stuff you like to do. Some of it's actually sorta neat.
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,rarity,"I... owe you an apology, too. Buckball may not be my thing, but it's something you enjoy. And you're very good at it. I never should've treated your interests like they were worth less than mine."
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,Soooo... does this mean we're still friends?
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,rarity,I would very much like that. Now let's go find that amulet!
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,Wait! That tunnel leads to the... school? A secret passage! Awesome!
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,rarity,[gasps] Spikey-wikey! You stole the Amulet of Aurora?!
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,twilight sparkle,Not exactly.
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,rarity,"You mean, this was a setup to make us get along?"
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,starlight glimmer,"Sorry to interfere, but you both..."
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,...reeeeeally needed it.
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,smolder,"So even though you don't like any of the same stuff, you two are friends again?"
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,rarity,Heh. Always. I think we just needed a teensy reminder.
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,"Yeah. We don't have to love the exact same things to have fun together. I mean, imagine if we did! How boring would that be?"
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,rarity,"When we give each other a chance to share the different things we enjoy, it can be surprisingly wonderful! [sighs] Too bad we wasted our day of fun."
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,We still have a little time left. You wanna... go hit the shops? I could actually use your help picking out some new buckball gear.
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,rarity,"Do I?! But only if you help me choose some buckball fan attire, so I can cheer for my favorite player at the drop of a fabulous hat!"
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,rainbow dash,"Uh, yeah! Let's go already!"
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,twilight sparkle,[to students] See? Good friends always work through their differences.
The End in Friend,Gillian M. Berrow,starlight glimmer,[laughs] Even if it takes a little help.
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,fluttershy,"Huh? [gasps] Some poor creature's in trouble! We have to help it! Oh, listen to that suffering! It must be in horrible agony!"
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,fluttershy,Ooh! It sounds like a herd of injured chimerae! [pants] Or it's Cerberus with snifflitis in two of its heads and kennel cough in its third. Or maybe it's<U+0097>
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,fluttershy,Pinkie Pie?
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,fluttershy,"Ugh. At least no animal is suffering. Right, Angel?"
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,fluttershy,"[laughs nervously] Well, until now."
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,applejack,What is that thing?
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,twilight sparkle,"It's called a yovidaphone. It's from Yakyakistan, where it's actually quite popular."
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,rainbow dash,Is it supposed to sound like that?
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,twilight sparkle,"Not exactly. It's known to produce a fairly complicated, melodically rich, and harmonious tone."
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,rainbow dash,Are you sure we're talking about the same thing?
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,pinkie pie,[panting] Phew! And that's with only a few days of practice! Can you believe it?!
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,rarity,"Yes. Yes, I can."
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,applejack,I can honestly say I've never heard anything like it in my life.
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,pinkie pie,"Well, if you enjoyed listening to my playing half as I enjoyed playing my playing, then I should totally play more! That way, we'll be even!"
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,twilight sparkle,"Oh, I don't think that's necessary, Pinkie."
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,rainbow dash,Please. Don't.
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,pinkie pie,"There's a chance I may have missed a note or two here or there, but I just love playing so much! [sighs] You complete me."
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,twilight sparkle,"Well, I, for one, am glad you're having so much fun with your new hobby."
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,pinkie pie,[not listening] Uh-huh. Sure.
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,twilight sparkle,"And it's great that you're learning a new skill, and... and you're just waiting for me to finish talking so you can start playing again, aren't ya?"
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,fluttershy,"[sighs, to Angel Bunny] It's okay. She's gone."
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,applejack,Anypony else think that sounded like an apple core cut up in a pulp grinder?
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,rarity,"Apple-solutely! Uh, absolutely."
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,twilight sparkle,"Okay, so maybe she isn't good yet. But she's our friend, and we should be supportive."
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,applejack,She just started playin'. She's bound to get better. Right?
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,rainbow dash,"Yeah, we just need to be supportive of her practicing... [groans] So the getting-better part happens as fast as possible."
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,twilight sparkle,"[sighs] You're absolutely right, Spike. Sometimes it is nice to get out of the library and be in the sun."
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,spike,Especially when you take the library with you.
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,applejack,"[burbles, sighs] We need to do somethin' about Pinkie Pie's playin'!"
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,rainbow dash,"Like, now!"
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,twilight sparkle,Is it really that bad?
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,rainbow dash,Does this answer your question?
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,twilight sparkle,"Uh, a trophy?"
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,rainbow dash,For second place. Second! Place! All because of Pinkie's playing!
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,applejack,"And thanks to her fruit-blastin' melodies, I got an orchard full of nothin' but applesauce! And it ain't even saucin' season!"
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,rarity,And just look what her playing did to poor Fluttershy!
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,applejack,"I mean, I know we said we should all be supportive, but Pinkie's been playin' for moons now, and she's not gettin' any better."
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,rainbow dash,"Yeah! If anything, she's gotten worse!"
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,twilight sparkle,"Okay, maybe we can just pretend she's really good, and then I'll find a spell that will<U+0097>"
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,applejack,"Oh, no, no, no! We're not goin' through that again! Remember how well it worked out when you weren't honest with Celestia about her actin' ability?"
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,twilight sparkle,[groans] You're right. We'll just have to tell Pinkie Pie she's not very good at the yovidaphone.
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,rarity,"Well, there's no time like the present."
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,pinkie pie,"Phew! Huh, that's weird. I coulda sworn this place was packed a second ago. Hey, guys! Can I favor you all with a tune? I take requests!"
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,applejack,"Actually, we do have a request, and yeah, it involves your yovidaphone."
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,pinkie pie,"You mean the thing I love more than anything else in Equestria? My sun, my moon, my stars, my everything? Ooh! Tell me, tell me, tell me!"
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,applejack,"All right. In all honesty... Uh, in all honesty... Rarity has somethin' to say!"
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,rarity,"Pinkie, please listen to Rainbow Dash."
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,rainbow dash,"Ugh, fine! So, Pinkie, remember when we all were shocked to discover Princess Celestia wasn't so good at acting?"
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,pinkie pie,"Yeah, she was awful! But that's kind of a random thing to bring up. I thought you wanted to talk about my yovidaphone playing."
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,rainbow dash,"Well, it's, uh... It's just... You need to know, uh... Twilight?"
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,twilight sparkle,"[sighs] Pinkie, we all support you, but we're afraid you're just not good at the yovidaphone, and none of us want you to waste your time on something you can't do well."
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,pinkie pie,Oh. [upbeat] Why didn't you just say so?
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,rainbow dash,[sighs] We were all really nervous to tell you.
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,pinkie pie,"Why? It's just a silly instrument. Well, lunch break's over. Gotta get back to the bakery. Those apple turnovers aren't gonna apple themselves! [whistles gleefully] No more yovidaphone playing for me-e-e!"
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,fluttershy,Wow. She took that so much better than I thought.
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,twilight sparkle,[sighs] Another beautiful day in Ponyville.
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,spike,"Uh, Twilight, when was the last time you saw Pinkie Pie?"
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,twilight sparkle,"Hmmm, not since we told her to stop playing the yovidaphone. I'm still surprised with how well she took it."
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,spike,I don't think she took it as well as you think she took it.
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,pinkie pie,Is it morning? I hadn't noticed.
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,twilight sparkle,That's not good.
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,rainbow dash,There you are! We've been looking all over for you!
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,rarity,It turns out Pinkie may not have taken our critique of her yovidaphone playing in the spirit with which it was intended.
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,twilight sparkle,I saw.
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,spike,There's gotta be something we can do.
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,twilight sparkle,"I'm sure there is, Spike. We just have to figure out what."
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,rainbow dash,[sighs] I don't get it. So she's no good at playing the yovidaphone. What's the big deal? There are so many other things she's really good at doing.
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,applejack,Yeah! Not bein' able to play the yovidaphone is nothin' compared to all the things she can do well.
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,twilight sparkle,"And that's exactly what we'll show her! I bet if we get her to do the stuff she likes and is good at doing, she'll cheer right back up and forget all about the yovidaphone."
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,applejack,Hoo-whee! That's a great idea!
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,rarity,"Let's get started. Apparently, there's not a moment to lose."
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,twilight sparkle,"So, I'm guessing nopony had any success?"
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,applejack,[sighs] My party cannon idea was a real dud.
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,rainbow dash,Don't blame yourself. None of us did any better.
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,twilight sparkle,"Well, not to worry. I came up with the perfect solution. Instead of trying to remind her what she's good at, we'll remind her what she's best at. And that's being our friend. We're gonna throw her a Pinkie Pie Appreciation Party!"
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,fluttershy,"That's a wonderful idea! If anypony needs to know how much she's appreciated, it's Pinkie Pie."
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,rainbow dash,"We can get the whole town involved, just so she can see what a good friend she is to everypony."
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,twilight sparkle,Then I hereby officially declare today Pinkie Pie Appreciation Day!
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,rarity,Now this is perfection!
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,rainbow dash,"Yeah! If anything could help Pinkie Pie cheer up and make her forget about her yovidaphone, this is definitely it!"
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,applejack,"Sure is! Okay, who's gonna get her?"
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,twilight sparkle,"No need. Gummy's on it. In fact, there he is now!"
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,applejack,"Uh, Gummy? You were supposed to bring Pinkie Pie. What happened?"
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,rarity,Is she still coming?
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,twilight sparkle,"Fluttershy, can you understand what he's saying?"
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,fluttershy,I could... if he was talking.
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,spike,"Let me try something. [slowly, loudly, and deliberately] Gummy! Where is Pinkie Pie?!"
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,twilight sparkle,Maybe we should just go and get her.
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,applejack,What in tarnation is goin' on here?!
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,rarity,This decor is dreadful.
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,rainbow dash,And all of Pinkie's stuff is... gone?!
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,rarity,It is a puzzle.
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,maud pie,[deadpan] Excuse me.
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,rarity,"Oh, yes, of course."
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,twilight sparkle,"Um, Maud? Can I ask you a question?"
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,maud pie,[deadpan] You just did.
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,applejack,"Well, can I ask you a question?"
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,maud pie,[deadpan] You just did.
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,rainbow dash,[groans] Fine! How about if I ask you a<U+0097> Wait.
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,rarity,"Oh, for goodness' sakes! Maud. All of your sister's things are gone. Explain."
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,maud pie,"[deadpan] No, they're not. They're right here."
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,fluttershy,Have you seen Pinkie Pie?
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,maud pie,Lots of times. I grew up with her.
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,twilight sparkle,"Okay, let's try this a different way. Why did you pack up all of Pinkie's things?"
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,maud pie,[deadpan] She asked me to.
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,maud pie,[deadpan] Pinkie told me to pack up her room and take everything to the rock farm.
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,maud pie,[deadpan] She said she wouldn't need them since she's moving to Yakyakistan.
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,rarity,"Terribly sorry, Maud. Must've misheard you. It almost sounded like you said Pinkie's [chuckling] moved to Yakyakistan!"
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,applejack,"Uh, Rarity? She did say that."
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,rarity,"Uh, terribly sorry, Applejack. Must've misheard you. It almost sounded like you said [chuckling] she did say that!"
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,twilight sparkle,"Maud, I don't understand. Why would Pinkie leave Ponyville?"
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,rainbow dash,Yeah! Why would she want to go live with the yaks?
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,maud pie,"[deadpan] She said without the yovidaphone, her life had no meaning, and at least in Yakyakistan, she could listen to the masters play. She hoped that would give her some semblance of happiness."
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,rarity,"Well, no! No-no-no-no-no-no-no! That will not do!"
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,applejack,I say we go to Yakyakistan right now and make her come back home!
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,twilight sparkle,We can't just march up there and tell Pinkie what to do.
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,fluttershy,[tearing up] But... we didn't even get a chance to say goodbye!
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,twilight sparkle,"Well, we may not be able to go to Yakyakistan and force her to come home, but we could go say goodbye... and if we happen to mention how much her friendship means to us, and how much we'd miss her if she were gone forever, and then she decided to come back home on her own..."
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,rainbow dash,Then what are we waiting around here for?! Let's get going to Yakyakistan!
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,twilight sparkle,We're almost there.
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,applejack,Pinkie's gotta be around here somewhere.
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,fluttershy,But where?
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,rarity,Is that...?
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,twilight sparkle,The music of the yovidaphone.
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,rainbow dash,Are you sure? Because that actually sounds kinda... good.
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,twilight sparkle,"Oh, I'm sure. Come on."
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,rainbow dash,Huh. Not what I expected.
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,rainbow dash,"Oh, sorry."
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,rainbow dash,[hushed] I said I was sorry!
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,fluttershy,"[hushed, gasps] There she is!"
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,pinkie pie,[gulps] [despondent] Gimme another.
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,pinkie pie,"I said, gimme another!"
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,twilight sparkle,[grunts] Pardon me!
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,applejack,Excuse us.
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,rainbow dash,"Oh, uh, sorry!"
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,pinkie pie,[despondent] I feel nothing.
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,twilight sparkle,Maybe we can help with that.
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,pinkie pie,[despondent] Oh. Hey. What are you guys doing here?
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,applejack,Just hear us out.
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,rainbow dash,We respect your decision to move to Yakyakistan.
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,twilight sparkle,"But we just wanted to remind you how much you mean to us, and how much we'd miss you if you decided to move here for<U+0097>"
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,pinkie pie,[despondent] Fine. I'll move back to Ponyville.
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,rainbow dash,Wow. That was a lot easier than I thought. We're awesome!
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,twilight sparkle,"Pinkie, what's wrong?"
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,pinkie pie,[despondent] That's what's wrong. I thought coming here and listening to real yovidaphone playing would make me happy.
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,pinkie pie,[despondent] It makes me feel worse. I'm never gonna sound like that.
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,pinkie pie,"[despondent] Eh. If I can't play it, I might as well do menial chores for those who can."
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,applejack,"Okay, so Pinkie Pie is obviously still miserable."
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,fluttershy,"Oh, I can't bear to see her like this."
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,rarity,Indeed. But what else can we do?
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,rainbow dash,"Yeah, we've tried everything!"
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,fluttershy,Maybe not. Look!
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,pinkie pie,[stifled giggling] Whoops! Sorry!
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,pinkie pie,I forgot what an awful yovidaphoner I am.
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,twilight sparkle,Playing it makes you so happy.
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,pinkie pie,[wistfully] [sighs] It sure does. I mean... it did.
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,twilight sparkle,Then you should never stop.
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,rarity,So say we all!
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,applejack,Absolutely.
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,pinkie pie,But... you were the ones who told me to stop because I wasn't good.
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,twilight sparkle,And we were wrong.
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,fluttershy,Playing makes you happy.
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,rarity,"And as long as it makes you happy, it doesn't matter how good you are!"
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,applejack,So get up there and show these yaks how it's done!
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,pinkie pie,"[stage whisper] I don't know if you've noticed, but the audience are all yaks, and they kind of have ""issues"" with things that aren't perfect! Like my playing!"
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,rainbow dash,"Pinkie Pie, you get up on that stage and play. If these yaks don't like it, they'll have to answer to us!"
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,pinkie pie,"Well, okay... If you all say so..."
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,rainbow dash,"[clears throat] Ladies and gentleyaks! Performing for her very first time here, let's give a big round of stomps for... Pinkie Pie!"
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,pinkie pie,"[clears throat] Um, hi! So, uh, any yaks here from out of town?"
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,pinkie pie,"Uhhh, I kinda wasn't expecting this."
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,rainbow dash,"Me, neither."
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,pinkie pie,You think so? Even though it wasn't perfect?
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,pinkie pie,"Well if that's the case, lemme play you the song I just wrote two seconds ago! It's called ""I've Got the Best Most Supportive Friends a Pony Could Ever Ask For""! [aside] It's a working title."
Yakity-Sax,Michael P. Fox & Wil Fox,twilight sparkle,And a-one...
Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,"[dramatically] I don't know, folks. She's been in there a long time!"
Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,Do you suppose the Terrifying Trunk Escape is too much for her?! What if the Great and Powerful Trixie can't<U+0097>?!
Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,trixie,Escape?!
Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,"But if you're there, who's in here?"
Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,trixie,"Why, our volunteer, of course!"
Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,granny smith,[coughs] Crabapple surprise! You shoulda oughta tell a pony before ya go a-poofin' 'em around the stage!
Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"Trixie, that was an amazing show!"
Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,princess cadance,Flurry Heart and I loved it! I'm so glad we decided to come. You two have a real chemistry.
Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,trixie,The Terrifying Trunk Escape does require a grrrreat and powerful assistant.
Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,princess cadance,"The way you two work together, it's like you've known each other as long as Twilight and I have."
Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,It was pretty fun.
Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,Of course it was! There's nothing better than a bond with another pony. You can share all kinds of things.
Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,I think we'll stick to the stage magic for now.
Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,trixie,The Great and Powerful Trixie doesn't chant.
Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,trixie,"[sighs] As much as I love my one-pony show, it's always nice to come to Ponyville and perform with my great and powerful assistant. Cadance is right. We do work well together!"
Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,Doing a show with you is almost as much fun as counseling students at Twilight's school! [gasps] Which I'm supposed to be doing right now!
Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,See ya later.
Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,trixie,"[giggles] Usually, ponies just call me Trixie. But ""Ms. Powerful"" has a nice ring."
Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,trixie,I was just about to set out on tour. [grunts] But Saddle Arabia is much farther than my usual route. [grunts] Ugh!
Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,trixie,"[laughs] And, uh, my caravan might not be suited for an extended tour."
Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,trixie,"Trade it?! Heavens, no! This is more than just some great and powerful wagon you see before you! It is shelter. It is transportation. It is my only friend on the long and lonely nights on the road."
Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,trixie,"""Many fans"", you say? [laughs] Well, I suppose I could consider the trip."
Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,trixie,Hmmm...
Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,trixie,"It's just so far away. Of course, I love visiting new and exciting places. I am a traveling magician after all."
Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,Hmmm. Sounds like your mind's made up.
Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,trixie,Not quite. The road is a lonely place. And this trip even more so. I was hoping I might convince my grrrrreat and powerful assistant to come along?
Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,Really?
Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,trixie,Of course! You're not just my assistant and my counselor. You're also my friend. And what's better than a road trip with friends?
Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,Nothing! This will be the best magical road trip ever!
Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,I should probably get somepony to cover my student counseling duties while we're gone.
Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,"Trixie, are you all right?"
Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,trixie,"One caravan for two all set! Oh. You brought luggage. [nervous laugh] I mean, of course you brought luggage!"
Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,"You bet I did! Everything two ponies need for the road trip of their lives! Three one-thousand-piece puzzles, one copy of Dragon Pit <U+0096> the best board game in the history of ponies <U+0096> my famous collection of campfire spices, and an inflatable raft. Did I forget something? I could pop back to the castle and grab it."
Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,trixie,"Oh, no. It isn't that."
Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,"Yeah, maybe we don't need the raft."
Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,trixie,"[sighs] We just needed a little great and powerful rrrrreorganization! [struggling] Now, everything... fits.. just... fine!"
Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,trixie,[sighs] Who am I kidding? My wagon is too small for us. I understand if you're having second thoughts.
Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,Second thoughts? [scoffs] Are you kidding? This wagon isn't small. It's... eh... cozy. And there's no such thing as too cozy.
Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,trixie,"Well, all right then! I guess it's time to hit the road! [struggling] I'll... start us off..."
Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,[coughs] Okay. Maybe there is such a thing as too cozy.
Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,trixie,You're sure you wouldn't rather ride?
Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,I'm sure.
Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,trixie,And you're not backing out? The two of us sleeping in that cozy caravan could get tricky.
Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,"Trixie, there's plenty of high-quality inns to stay at on the way. Don't worry about it. I'm not backing out of the greatest and most powerful road trip bonding experience two ponies could ever have."
Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,trixie,"Well, when you put it like that, I'm actually kind of excited!"
Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,"Me, too! [sighs] Thank goodness we're not like Twilight or the others. They'd probably sing a song about it."
Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,"Beats walking though, eh, Trix?"
Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,trixie,"But road trips are a great way, we've been told, to get along"
Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,"I'm glad we're sticking to it, we've already got a song"
Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,trixie,Our bond of friendship is stronger than this tour's demands
Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,"Wait, what did he say?"
Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,trixie,Nothing!
Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,trixie,"Sure is great traveling with you, buddy!"
Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,"You too, buddy!"
Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,trixie,"Yes, we are!"
Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,Any trip can be exhausting if you make a fuss
Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,trixie,But we get on so well that's there no way that could be us
Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,trixie,Was that off-key?
Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,"In summer, winter, spring, and fall, we're friends throughout the year"
Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,trixie,"For untold seasons yet to come,  our friendship will be here"
Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,"For nine, at least!"
Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,trixie,[quickly] Like a race where you tie your hooves together and you have to move in perfect synchronization to win!
Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,[quickly] Or like a buddy movie where the two protagonists can't get away from each other because they're wearing hoof-cuffs!
Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,trixie,"Ooh, the marketplace. Perfect! I've learned the hard way that life on the road requires very specific supplies. And we only have so many bits. So we'll have to spend them wise..."
Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,trixie,...ly.
Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,[sighs] Sorry about wasting bits on street food.
Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,trixie,"Oh, it's fine. Falafel bonding, right? [laughs] Besides, we still have enough for... haycakes and juice."
Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,"Um, why don't we go there?"
Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,trixie,"Oh, no-no-no. I always buy my haycakes here."
Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,"So we're just going to wait in line for hours? Uh, which is totally cool! Waiting-in-line bonding! Right?"
Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,trixie,"After our falafel purchase, we weren't able to get everything on my list. But we are definitely set for breakfast."
Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,And I'm sure we'll find out that waiting in that super-long line was worth it.
Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,trixie,A few hiccups always happen. We'll be back on the road to friendship after a good night's sleep.
Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,"Uh, I'm sure we'll find something."
Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,trixie,"[laughs, to Starlight] You said there'd be plenty of places to stay. ""Don't even worry about it,"" you said. Ya might've thought to make a reservation!"
Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,"Um, I've been with you singing and standing in line. When would I have done that?"
Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,trixie,I don't know. But I'm starting to think you aren't as great and powerful an assistant as I thought!
Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,So you just brought me along to do your legwork?
Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,trixie,[sighs] No. Of course not. I'm sorry. I'm just frustrated. I was really looking forward to a relaxing night in a nice room.
Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,"[sighs] Me, too. But since there's literally no room at the inns, I guess it's lucky we've got the wagon."
Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,[unenthusiastically] Sleeping-in-tight-quarters bonding.
Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,trixie,Is there something I can do to make things more comfortable for you?
Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,You could get rid of this junk.
Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,trixie,"Yes, well, before we throw away the magical items it's taken me years to collect, we could try switching hammocks."
Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,Fine.
Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,trixie,[gasps] Hmm? [whispering] Starlight! Starlight! I think there's a wild animal outside!
Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,trixie,Starlight?
Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,trixie,Starlight!
Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,[startled noises] What?
Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,trixie,"I'm sorry. Your snoring is a bit, um..."
Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,"Loud? [nervous laugh] Yeah, I do that. I had my village convinced we were being attacked by bears every night."
Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,"[laughs, clears throat] But we probably need a better solution here."
Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,trixie,[sleepily muttering] Ladies and gentleponies... Great and Powerful Trixie... amazing feats...
Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,Seriously?!
Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,trixie,[sleepily muttering] Prepare to be amazed...
Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,trixie,[grumpily] Sleep well?
Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,[grumpily] Sure did.
Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,trixie,"Is, uh, that the last of the haycakes?"
Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,[chomps] Oh. Yeah. Sorry.
Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,trixie,It's fine.
Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,I don't suppose there's any more juice.
Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,trixie,[glugs] Ahhh! Nah. I guess we'll have to resupply.
Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,Is he gonna be following us for the whole time?!
Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,trixie,I do not know.
Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,[flatly] She's been in there a long time. Do you suppose the Terrifying Trunk Escape is too much for a pony who drinks all the juice and talks non-stop in her sleep?! What if the Great and Powerful Trixie can't...
Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,trixie,Sleep?! Because her roommate snores like an ursa major?!
Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,"[flatly] But if you're there, who's in here?"
Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,trixie,At least you don't have to sleep in it with another pony!
Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,trixie,Oh. Would you like the last carrot? I know how fond you are of eating the last of things.
Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,"Oh, no. It might make me thirsty, and we don't have anything to drink. So..."
Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,trixie,"The good news is I'm so exhausted, I could sleep through a stampede of wild boars! Which, you'll be delighted to know, is only slightly louder than your snoring."
Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,"Well, I'm looking forward to rehearsing the act with you all night. So diligent of you to go over it and over it in your sleep."
Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,trixie,[through gritted teeth] Practice makes perfect.
Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,"Not today, it didn't."
Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,trixie,"Well, I'm sorry you're so miserable!"
Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,"Really?! Because if you wanted to make things more comfortable, you could always pare down a bit!"
Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,trixie,"Well, since you're so concerned about space, you can have it all! I'll sleep under the stars, where at least the wild animals will be QUIETER THAN YOU!"
Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,[derisive laugh] Ya think?!
Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,trixie,[gasps] Where's my wagon?!
Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,I traded it to that pony from Saddle Arabia for his. He even threw in a pair of robes.
Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,trixie,You what?!
Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,"I traded the old, worn-out wagon that was too small for us, for this nice spacious one that we can both enjoy."
Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,trixie,[stammering] Who said you could do that?!
Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,"Nopony. I just did it. [sighs] Now we both have plenty of room, and you didn't even have to give anything away."
Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,trixie,Au contraire. I did give something away! I gave away my wagon... and my best friend!
Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,Oh! I'm sorry! I didn't realize you were better friends with that beat-up old wagon than you are with me!
Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,trixie,"Well, it's easy when the wagon is a better friend! It would've never traded you away!"
Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,That's ridiculous.
Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,trixie,"Oh, it is ridiculous. In fact, this whole tour is ridiculous! I don't even know why I invited you in the first place!"
Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,"Well, maybe I should just head home!"
Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,trixie,I think that's a very good idea! And you can take this horrible giant caravan with you!
Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,Fine!
Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,trixie,Good!
Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,trixie,[grunting] Come on! Whoa!
Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,trixie,"Normally, that sort of flattery would suffice. But today, we must discuss your dishonest and unfair procurement of my wagon!"
Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,trixie,"Unfortunately, it is more nuanced than that!"
Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,trixie,Ha! We'll just see about that!
Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,trixie,[grumbles] Details!
Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,[struggling] You all seemed... a lot less threatening when there were two of us!
Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,"[gasps, yells] This place is awful! How did I not see it before?!"
Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,trixie,Thank you. No.
Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,What are you two doing?
Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,trixie,"Taking a stand! By lying down! Not that you care, Wagon-Trader-Away-er!"
Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,"Trixie, I came back to apologize. I should never have traded away the wagon. It wasn't mine to trade. It belongs to my friend."
Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,trixie,Okay! Fine! We're friends! Best friends who share a deep bond who weren't prepared for the emotional challenges of traveling. Happy?!
Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,trixie,How?
Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,"Uh, we could do our friendship chant!"
Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,trixie,"Oh, right... Our world-famous chant of friendship that we do all the time because we're such great friends."
Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,trixie,So you'll give back the wagon?
Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,That's fair.
Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,I'm sorry your Saddle Arabian tour was ruined.
Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,trixie,"Honestly, I don't think I could've stood one more second on the road. At a certain point, I don't even like traveling with myself."
Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,"It is a lot harder than I thought. Still, I'm glad we tried. Mostly so we know not to do it again."
Road to Friendship,Josh Haber,trixie,I think it's made our friendship greater and more powerful than ever!
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,scootaloo,"Order, order, everypony! I hereby call to order this meeting of the Rainbow Dash Fan Club!"
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,scootaloo,First order of business <U+0096> [quickly] Let's-celebrate-the-one-and-only-Rainbow-Dash-yay-she's-amazing-now-if-there's-nothing-else-that-concludes-this-meeting-of-the-Rainbow-Dash-Fan-Club-thank-you-all-for-coming-any-questions?!
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,rainbow dash,Huh?
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,scootaloo,Meeting adjourned!
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,scootaloo,"I'd like to call to order the first ever meeting of the newest and most exciting club <U+0096> of which I am the president, founding, and only member <U+0096> the Washouts Fan Club!"
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,rainbow dash,"Oh, hey, Scootaloo. I was just in the neighbor<U+0097> Oh! What's this? Did I interrupt your fan club meeting?"
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,scootaloo,Hey! What are you doin' here?
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,rainbow dash,I could ask you the same question!
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,scootaloo,"Oh, uh, y'know... mmm... s-s-stuff. Uh, definitely not starting a new fan club or anything."
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,rainbow dash,"Ha! It's no use pretending! I heard everything when I was outside eavesdropping, like I do for every meeting!"
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,scootaloo,You eavesdrop on every meeting? That's weird.
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,rainbow dash,"Well, sure it sounds weird when you say it out loud. And I probably shouldn't because eavesdropping is wrong, but still. Why are you starting a new fan club?"
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,scootaloo,I just think maybe it's time for me to explore other fan clubs.
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,rainbow dash,"[gasps] What is a ""The Washouts""?"
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,scootaloo,"Only the newest, and greatest, and only stunt troupe in Equestria!"
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,rainbow dash,Stunt troupe?
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,rainbow dash,"""Twenty bajillion""?!"
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,scootaloo,They do all sorts of extreme stunts that focus on daredevilry and sheer guts rather than boring old flight and formation junk.
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,rainbow dash,"""Boring old flight and formation junk""?!"
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,scootaloo,Are you just repeating everything I say?
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,rainbow dash,Only because my brain feels like it's strapped to one of those rockets about to explode.
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,scootaloo,So you do get it! Aren't they awesome?!
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,rainbow dash,Can you believe she actually said that?!
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,"Pfft, well, yeah! Eavesdropping on every meeting is kinda weird."
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,rainbow dash,"I mean, she basically said that the Wonderbolts aren't cool! And... And it kinda sounded like she didn't think I was cool either. But, peh, we all know that's crazy! I mean, I'm definitely not worried about her looking up to somepony else. Heh. Nope. Not! At! All!"
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,applejack,"Well, I'd understand if you were. It'd be like if Apple Bloom started lovin' bananas more than apples. [laughs, sotto voce] Y'all tell me if that ever happens, ya hear?"
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,rainbow dash,But what could the Washouts possibly have that I don't?!
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,Why don't you find out?
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,rainbow dash,They're doing a show in Ponyville this weekend?!
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,twilight sparkle,"Wow! They do look pretty amazing... uh, -ly unamazing. [nervous laugh] Trying so hard to look amazing is what I mean."
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,scootaloo,Awww. I knew we shoulda lined up last night.
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,rainbow dash,Look at this! It's a total Wonderbolts ripoff!
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,scootaloo,What do you mean? The show hasn't even started yet.
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,rainbow dash,"Yeah, but look at what we're sitting on."
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,rainbow dash,"Hello?! The Wonderbolts have bleachers, too! We practically invented sitting on bleachers!"
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,rarity,Ugh!
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,rainbow dash,And look at that! Popcorn and cotton candy?! Ripoff!
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,scootaloo,Huh? Yeeeeeeeaaaahhh!
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,pinkie pie,Mmmm! Quality confetti cannon work.
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,scootaloo,"Oh, yeah!"
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,scootaloo,Woo-hoo!
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,rainbow dash,Lame.
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,rainbow dash,"Whoa. Come on, come on! She's not gonna make it!"
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,rainbow dash,That... was... insane! Woo-hoo!
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,scootaloo,I told you!
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,rainbow dash,I mean... [clears throat] It was pretty cool. Who are these guys?
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,scootaloo,I can't just go up and talk to them.
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,rainbow dash,"You can if you're with me. After all, one of the reasons there's a Rainbow Dash fan club is because I'm fearless. Observe."
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,rainbow dash,Hey!
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,rainbow dash,"Uh, so as a fellow aerobatic professional, I really enjoyed your show. Heh. Actually, you might recognize me since I'm a... pause for dramatic effect... a Wonderbolt."
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,rainbow dash,O... kay...
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,rainbow dash,No way!
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,rainbow dash,Cool!
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,rainbow dash,What's your story?
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,rainbow dash,"Uhhh... Okay. So, who's the leader?"
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,rainbow dash,[gasps] Lightning Dust!
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,lightning dust,Rainbow Dash!
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,scootaloo,Scootaloo. I'm Scootaloo. Hi.
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,rainbow dash,"Lightning Dust! I should've known you were the brains behind a crazy idea like the Washouts! Or should I say, ""lack of brains""!"
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,scootaloo,"You two really know each other? Oh, my gosh! This is so cool!"
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,lightning dust,"Your ""friend"" got me kicked out of the Wonderbolts."
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,scootaloo,"Oh. That's, uh, less cool."
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,lightning dust,"And it was the best thing that ever happened to me! Great to see you, wingpony! I heard you're a full-fledged Bolt now."
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,rainbow dash,"Yeah, well, I'm still<U+0097>"
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,lightning dust,"Mad at me? Look, was it wrong of me to endanger the lives of your friends? Yeah. But, hey, now I only endanger these knuckleheads."
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,lightning dust,"C'mon, you know you miss me. Me and her, we blew everypony out of the sky."
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,scootaloo,Really?
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,lightning dust,"Actually, yeah, really! All that wind was totally dangerous, but we had fun, right? Two fastest times on the Dizzitron!"
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,rainbow dash,"If I remember correctly, I had you beat by half a second."
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,lightning dust,"Only because when I went, I cranked up the dizziness factor."
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,rainbow dash,"Well, I'm glad it all worked out. Your show was pretty dynamite."
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,lightning dust,[to Scootaloo] Wanna know the secret? We basically ignore everything the Wonderbolts ever taught us about safety.
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,rainbow dash,"Well, we do have safety rules for a reason."
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,lightning dust,"Don't listen to her, kid. All their ""rules"" were just ways of keeping their little club exclusive so they could feel good about themselves."
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,rainbow dash,It's not about making anypony feel bad. It's about finding the best flyers. The best of the best.
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,lightning dust,"I started the Washouts because I believe anypony can be the best of the best. You know, Rolling Thunder is gonna be out for a while."
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,lightning dust,There's a spot on the team if you wanna join up.
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,rainbow dash,"I appreciate the offer, but I'm already a Wonderbolt."
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,scootaloo,I'll do it! Can I do it?!
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,rainbow dash,"Uh, lemme think. No!"
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,scootaloo,[scoffs] I wasn't asking you!
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,lightning dust,"Awww, you're cute. But technically, you haven't washed out of the Bolts, which is kinda our thing."
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,rainbow dash,"And also, no!"
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,scootaloo,"Oh, what if I joined and dropped out super quick?!"
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,rainbow dash,That's it! You're comin' with me!
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,scootaloo,Where are we going?
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,rainbow dash,To hear what the actual Wonderbolts think about you joining just to drop out for the Washouts!
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,lightning dust,Say hi to Spitfire for me!
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,rainbow dash,Ever seen two simultaneous inverse displacement rolls before?
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,scootaloo,"[scoffs] Would've been a lot cooler if you had the Crushinator Jaws of Smashalot, patent pending."
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,rainbow dash,You... What?! [to Spitfire] See? This is what I was telling you about.
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,spitfire,I got this. [to Scootaloo] You know what happens when something goes wrong with the Crushinator Jaws of Smashalot?
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,rainbow dash,Patent pending?
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,spitfire,You end up in a full body wing-and-hoof cast drinkin' through a straw!
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,scootaloo,But with enough practice<U+0097>
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,spitfire,"Practice?! Well, la-dee-doodle-dah! Lemme give you a different scenario. You're probably saying to yourself, ""I'm young. I'm strong. I'm gonna go out there and stunt some tricks with my new friend Lightning Dust!"" Well, I'm here to tell ya that if ya play that game, you're gonna find out it's pretty hard to ""stunt tricks"" in a full body wing-and-hoof cast drinkin' through a straw!"
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,rainbow dash,I think she gets the poi<U+0097>
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,spitfire,"I'm not finished! Listen, I get it, kid. I used to be like you, tellin' myself, ""I'm gonna touch the sky!"""
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,scootaloo,I don't<U+0097>
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,spitfire,"Well, whoop-dee-doodle-doo! You think you got it made in the shade? Well, things are gonna be pretty shady indeed when you can't go out in the sun, 'cause you're in a full body wing-and-hoof cast drinkin' through a straw! Do I make myself clear?!"
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,scootaloo,[shakily] Uh-huh...
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,spitfire,Excellent. Have a hat.
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,rainbow dash,"Uh... Heh. Sorry that was a little... intense. I just wanna make sure you don't get hurt. That way, you can follow in my hoofsteps. Heh. Everypony's dream, right?"
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,scootaloo,"More like ""follow your wingflaps""."
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,rainbow dash,Same difference.
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,scootaloo,"[sarcastically] Thanks, super-talented flyer, for clearing up what I should do."
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,rainbow dash,"Clearing things up is one of my specialties. Now, come on. Let's go rip up all your Washout posters into tiny pieces and throw 'em off a cliff."
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,rainbow dash,"I just thought of a great way to raise awareness for your original fan club. You know, the one about me?"
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,rainbow dash,How about a silent auction where every item is just a picture of yours truly? [laughs] Nah! I'm just kidding.
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,rainbow dash,"That makes me seem too egotistical, doesn't it? Oh, oh! Maybe if they're framed, it's like, ""Wow, she's so humble!"" Ya think? Scootaloo?"
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,rainbow dash,"Uh, Scootaloo?"
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,rainbow dash,Anypony seen Scootalo<U+0097>
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,rainbow dash,"Ow! My fault, my fault! Sorry, I<U+0097> Twilight?"
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,twilight sparkle,[groans] Sorry. I was just... um...
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,rainbow dash,Please tell me you got that stuff so you could rip it up and throw it off a cliff.
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,twilight sparkle,They were doing an autograph session before practice.
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,rainbow dash,"Seriously?! [groans] You haven't seen Scoot, have you?"
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,twilight sparkle,Actually...
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,rainbow dash,I can't believe Scootaloo ditched me to watch them practice! Why can't she see how dangerous they are?!
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,twilight sparkle,That's kind of the whole draw. It's exciting.
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,rainbow dash,"But it's like the harder I try to convince Scoot they're dangerous, the more she likes them!"
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,twilight sparkle,"You can't control her actions. Only yours. Teach her what's safe and what isn't, like a good role model. Then hope she makes the right decisions."
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,rainbow dash,But what if she chooses them over me? She's gonna get hurt!
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,twilight sparkle,I think I know somepony else who might get hurt if that happens.
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,rainbow dash,"Um, maybe you're right. But this isn't about me. I'm just worried about Scoot."
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,lightning dust,"Sorry, Dash. Autograph session's over. Unless you wanna buy Short Fuse's limited edition half-eaten tomato sandwich."
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,rainbow dash,"You haven't seen Scootaloo, have you?"
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,lightning dust,"Ohhhh, isn't she that pony that used to respect you?"
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,rainbow dash,[growls] I'd appreciate you helping me find her so I could apologize for trying to make her quit liking you.
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,lightning dust,"[laughs] Oh, I'm pretty sure she still likes us."
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,rainbow dash,"Lightning Dust, I know we go way back, but I can't let her do this!"
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,scootaloo,I don't need you standing up for me!
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,rainbow dash,"Obviously, you do! Because you can't see how dangerous this is! Do you not remember what Spitfire said?"
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,lightning dust,Ugh. Lemme guess. [imitating Spitfire] You'll be in a full-body wing-and-hoof cast drinkin' through a straw!
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,rainbow dash,That doesn't even sound like Spitfire.
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,rainbow dash,That's it! We're leaving!
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,scootaloo,"Just because I look up to you doesn't mean I have to be you! But based on your definition of what makes somepony great, I have bad news. I'll never be the best of the best or a Wonderbolt! Because I! Can't! Fly! Is that what you wanted to hear? But not being able to fly doesn't mean I can't do something awesome! Like strapping my scooter to a multi-stage liquid-fueled rocket and jumping twenty-two wagons lined up in front of a roaring crowd!"
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,twilight sparkle,That was awfully specific.
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,lightning dust,That's 'cause it's what she'll be doing in the show tonight. Half off for princesses! [whispering] Bring your friends!
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,twilight sparkle,"Scootaloo, are you sure that's what you really wanna do?"
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,scootaloo,Absolutely. [to Rainbow] And there's nothing you can do to stop me!
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,rainbow dash,"You're right. You're your own foal, and you have to make your own decisions."
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,scootaloo,Good! Because I already have!
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,applejack,Hoo-wee! Looks like all of Ponyville is here. Except for Rainbow Dash.
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,lightning dust,"In just a moment, the newest member of the Washouts will be rocket-sledding down that hill, up that ramp, and over all twenty-two wagons to land on the other side in one piece! Heh. If she's lucky."
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,lightning dust,Put your hooves together for Half-Pint Dynamite!
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,scootaloo,"Lightning Dust, I have to tell you. I actually started Equestria's first Washouts fan club! As far as I know. So this is a real honor, ma'am! Uh, do I call you ""ma'am""?"
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,lightning dust,"You land this jump, you can call me whatever you want."
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,scootaloo,Wow. That sure is...
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,lightning dust,"Dangerous? Nah! Well, maybe a little."
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,scootaloo,Has anypony tested it before?
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,lightning dust,Where's the fun in that?
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,scootaloo,There's m-more?!
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,lightning dust,"You're not thinking of backing out, are you?"
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,scootaloo,No! I'm just thinking about drinking through straws.
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,lightning dust,Are you the president of my fan club or not?
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,scootaloo,Of course! It's just<U+0097>
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,lightning dust,"You wouldn't wanna get impeached for dishonoring my wishes, would you?"
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,scootaloo,I... Is that a thing?
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,lightning dust,Light it up!
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,scootaloo,Okay. Now I am thinking about backing out.
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,lightning dust,Too late!
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,rainbow dash,"I know I was supposed to let you make your own decisions, but that doesn't mean I can't swoop in and save you from time to time."
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,lightning dust,"If I'd known you were gonna bail, I would've done the trick myself!"
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,rainbow dash,Great! So you won't mind how that rope's about to coil around your hoof.
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,lightning dust,RIVALS FOR LIIIIIFE!
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,rainbow dash,Wouldn't have it any other way!
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,scootaloo,"I'm sorry for joining the Washouts. Lightning Dust wasn't who I thought she was. She didn't care about me being scared or putting me in danger. She only wanted a good show, even if it meant I got hurt. That's not the kind of pony I wanna look up to."
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,rainbow dash,I'm the one who should be apologizing for not acting like somepony who deserves a fan club. I've been lucky enough to have somepony who thinks I'm the coolest. But there's nothing cool about making you feel like you'll never be as awesome as me. I think we should cancel the Washouts Fan Club. Because I know a fan club that could use some new members.
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,scootaloo,The Rainbow Dash Fan Club!
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,rainbow dash,"[clears throat] Welcome to the first ever meeting of the newest fan club for the awesomest, previously under-appreciated pony in Ponyville! With founding member and president Rainbow Dash presiding, it's the... Scootaloo Fan Club!"
The Washouts,Nick Confalone,scootaloo,"You know, Rainbow Dash was right. Eavesdropping on your own fan club isn't weird at all."
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,rockhoof,"[grunting and laughing] You're going to have to work faster than that if you plan to dig up my whole village, lass. Let me help."
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,rockhoof,Aye. This place is full of memories. Did I tell you about the time our chieftain knocked down five boulders with the kick of a wee ball?
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,rockhoof,But... [stutters] That's what this is for.
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,rockhoof,Agh! Next you'll be sayin' I shouldn't have used the old sweat lodge.
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,twilight sparkle,"Of course, Professor Fossil! We'd be honored to have a Pillar of Equestria on our staff!"
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,rockhoof,"[slurps, crunch] Ugh! [spits, groans] That apple's made of wood! What a horrible trick to play!"
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,rarity,Hmm. Has anypony seen my decorative centerpieces? They were right here.
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,twilight sparkle,"So, join me in welcoming Professor Rockhoof to our faculty!"
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,rockhoof,"Thank you! Thank you, all! I know I'm new to your world, but there's one thing I learned when I saved my village from a rushing river of hot lava. There's nothing you can't do with hard work. And a shovel!"
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,smolder,Except maybe stand on stage.
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,twilight sparkle,"So, um... everycreature dismissed. We'll... see you in class!"
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,smolder,You think that new pony is gonna be the weirdest teacher at school or just one of the weirdest?
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,yona,Yona like new teacher. He big like yak!
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,gallus,"And he smashes things like a yak, smells like a yak..."
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,yona,Yes! He perfect!
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,sandbar,"Guys, he's one of the Pillars! He's like... pony history!"
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,rockhoof,"Hello, class!"
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,rockhoof,"Eh, um... [clears throat] I'm, uh, your new ""Theory and Defense of Friendship"" teacher."
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,rockhoof,"But, uh, I haven't had a chance to look at Headmare Twilight's notes yet. What have you all been learnin'?"
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,ocellus,We just studied all about how Princess Celestia and Luna used a spell to trap Discord in stone sleep for hundreds of moons.
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,rockhoof,"Ohhhh-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho! So it's a class about stories, is it?"
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,gallus,"Stories! Yeah! And we never, ever, ever get homework!"
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,rockhoof,Good! The best way to teach colts and fillies is by experience. Like the time I was in the woods and I ran across an ursa major!
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,silverstream,Really?!
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,sandbar,"We're not doing that, right?"
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,yona,You fight ursa major? All alone?
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,rockhoof,"Aye. And I defeated her, too."
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,smolder,Now this I'm interested in!
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,yona,How Professor Rockhoof win?
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,rockhoof,Well... that's quite a tale.
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,twilight sparkle,"From what Professor Fossil said, it sounds like Rockhoof just hasn't settled into modern times yet. Our school is the perfect place for that. Plus, we get a new teacher."
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,applejack,[chuckles] This may be the fastest friendship problem you ever solved.
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,rockhoof,Dodge! Thrust! Shovel leap! Shovel throw!
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,rockhoof,"Shovel whack! Now you lot be the ursa major. Lots o' growlin', mind?"
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,applejack,Maybe classrooms were less breakable in the old days?
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,yona,Ooh-ooh-ooh! What happened next?
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,rockhoof,"[laughing] The huge beastie jumped out of the moonlit mist, her fearsome fangs at my throat! But I rolled clear."
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,silverstream,Then what?
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,rockhoof,"She backed me up against a wall, ready to pounce!"
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,rockhoof,I looked at her. She looked at me. And I say<U+0097>!
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,twilight sparkle,"Uh, Professor Rockhoof?"
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,rockhoof,"Nope! Guess again! [clears throat] Uh, oops."
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,twilight sparkle,"Sorry to interrupt. Class, why don't we go ahead and take lunch early today? Rockhoof, can we take a walk outside?"
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,twilight sparkle,Our school is about finding your own special way to teach.
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,twilight sparkle,But maybe you could do a little less smashing in the classroom?
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,twilight sparkle,I know it's a big change. But I think you're gonna fit in just<U+0097>
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,rockhoof,Fire!
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,twilight sparkle,"Rockhoof, wait!"
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,rockhoof,No time! The building's ablaze! We have to get everypony out!
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,yona,Professor Rockhoof best teacher ever! [sighs] Day cannot get better.
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,rockhoof,"Let's get you outside, wee ones!"
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,yona,Day just got better!
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,rockhoof,Alley-oop!
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,applejack,Rockhoof?
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,twilight sparkle,What are you doing?!
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,rockhoof,Savin' the school!
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,rockhoof,Just like fightin' a volcano in the good old days!
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,rarity,Would somepony kindly explain what is the meaning of all this water?!
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,pinkie pie,I'm not sure. But I think it's surf's up! Woo-hoo! Cowabunga!
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,rockhoof,"Sorry, Rarity, but I had to put out the ragin' inferno."
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,spike,Inferno? Where?
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,rockhoof,Did you not see the smoke and flame?
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,smolder,"Yeah, that was us. You know, dragons? Having a fire-breathing competition?"
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,rockhoof,"You, uh... what?"
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,twilight sparkle,[panting] They do it all the time. That's what we were trying to tell you.
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,applejack,"We know you're used to bein' a hero, Rockhoof. Only what we need here is a teacher."
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,rarity,One who doesn't ruin an entire class's friendship quilts. Do you know how hard it is to stitch a pineapple pattern?!
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,rockhoof,[sighs] My deepest apologies. I'm not used to living with dragons or much else in this modern time. Professor Fossil made it clear I'm not welcome back in my old village. Seems I don't belong here either.
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,pinkie pie,Wheeeee!
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,twilight sparkle,"So apparently, finding Rockhoof a new job is a lot harder than we thought. Has anypony had any luck?"
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,applejack,I-I thought you were gonna try him out at the post office.
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,twilight sparkle,We did.
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,rockhoof,[yelling] Do you know where I can find Cranky Doodle Donkey?! I need to deliver his medicine! He has a rash in a very embarrassing place!
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,spike,[shudders] I did not need to hear that.
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,rarity,Yup. Rockhoof's time as a spa masseuse didn't work out either.
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,rockhoof,Now just let me know if this is too much pressure!
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,rainbow dash,"W-Well, at least Rockhoof's really strong. Maybe we could find him a job carrying heavy stuff?"
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,pinkie pie,"I tried that already. Zecora needed somepony to help her get supplies, but..."
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,rockhoof,"I know you said you only needed a few leaves, but I figured why not bring you the whole thing?"
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,rarity,"Oh, how horrid."
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,fluttershy,None of the other Pillars seem to be having trouble fitting into the modern world.
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,applejack,Then maybe they can show Rockhoof how they did it. Get him used to livin' in this time.
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,twilight sparkle,Great idea! Rockhoof's old friends would be happy to help. And I bet he'd love to visit them.
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,rockhoof,[sighs] Even Canterlot looks different from the old days.
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,applejack,"Aww. I'm sure once you see your old pal Flash Magnus, you'll feel right at home."
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,rockhoof,"Flash Magnus, as I live and breathe! Is this your squadron?"
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,twilight sparkle,Princess Celestia was happy to find a new drill sergeant for her guard!
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,rockhoof,Uh... that's great. She really put you in a job that big so soon?
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,rockhoof,They made you the royal landscape artist for the Crystal Empire?
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,applejack,Wow...
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,twilight sparkle,Your work is beautiful.
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,rockhoof,You always could find the beauty in things. But there's not much demand for shovel ponies like me nowadays.
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,twilight sparkle,[whispering] Somnambula's a motivational speaker. Bet they didn't even have those back in your time.
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,rockhoof,[whispering] Because we didn't need them. Ponies knew what to do with their lives.
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,applejack,Guess he wished he could take a nap?
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,rockhoof,"Mage Meadowbrook, your home looks just the same as the old days. Wish I could say the same for mine."
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,rockhoof,"Thing is, I can't do my old job like Flash. Or adapt like Mistmane. Or succeed at something new like Somnambula. Or go home, like you."
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,applejack,Yeah! And I bet Stygian took plenty o' time to fit in.
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,twilight sparkle,"Hey, look what I found! Me and My Shadow, the third hit novel by former villain Stygian! I'm impressed! He's really thriving!"
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,twilight sparkle,Rockhoof? Where are you going?
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,rockhoof,I'm not sure. Maybe I just don't belong in this modern world.
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,applejack,"Now this here's a right mash of apples. 'Stead of solvin' Rockhoof's problem, we made him feel even worse."
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,rainbow dash,I'll tell you the real problem here. We haven't given Rockhoof the chance to be who he really is.
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,pinkie pie,A pony with a metal shovel and a heart of gold?
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,rainbow dash,Ugh. A hero! What we need to do is find him a job that's as epic as he is!
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,twilight sparkle,Hmm. I might know just the thing.
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,rockhoof,"I'm honored to serve in the Hippogriff Navy, General Seaspray! I promise I'll prove my worth."
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,rockhoof,"Like you didn't fit in, no matter how hard you tried?"
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,applejack,"[whispering, to Twilight Sparkle] Uh, why do the Hippogriffs need ships if they can turn into seaponies?"
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,twilight sparkle,Maybe they just like cruises?
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,rockhoof,"Wait, General! We can navigate the same way my Coltic ancestors traveled through the Selkie Mists! We'll look to the stars! There in the northwest sky is the constellation O'Bridle's Pelt! Steer the ship toward that!"
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,applejack,Yee-haw! Rockhoof did it!
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,rockhoof,But... I don't understand! The stars have always steered me true!
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,twilight sparkle,"Oh, no. Stars can move slowly over time. They must look different now than over a thousand years ago."
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,twilight sparkle,"Hey, mistakes happen. We'll think of something else for you to do."
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,rockhoof,"Oh, there's no need, lass. I already know what I want to do next."
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,applejack,Really? What?
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,rockhoof,I heard there's a statue spell that sends creatures into stone sleep. I want you to cast it. On me.
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,twilight sparkle,No!
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,rockhoof,Yes!
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,twilight sparkle,No!
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,rockhoof,Aye!
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,twilight sparkle,No!
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,rockhoof,Aye!
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,spike,"Hey, guys. Need me to help you decide something?"
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,twilight sparkle,Rockhoof wants me to cast a spell to turn him into a statue! The answer is no!
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,spike,Whoa. I thought you were arguing over ice cream flavors.
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,twilight sparkle,The answer is still no! Why would you want to be turned into stone?
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,rockhoof,Because I'm a relic of a bygone age. I belong in a museum. Safe. Preserved. Untouched. I don't belong in this time. It's up to you to make that right.
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,twilight sparkle,But there has to be a better way!
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,rockhoof,"Twilight, please understand. I want to be remembered as the hero I was, not the disappointment I've become."
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,twilight sparkle,"But you're not! Rockhoof, wait! Spike, can you teach my class today?"
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,spike,"Uh, you're not really going to turn him to stone, are you?"
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,twilight sparkle,"Only because it's temporary. As soon as I think of a new solution, we'll wake Rockhoof up. I know he has more to offer the world as a pony than a statue."
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,sandbar,Did you hear Rockhoof caught all the bees in the Everfree Forest and gave 'em to Zecora as a gift?
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,silverstream,Wow! Terramar said Rockhoof called down the stars and sunk the whole Hippogriff Navy!
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,smolder,"He's definitely weird, but in a fun way. You never know what's gonna happen next with him."
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,yona,Professor Rockhoof best pony!
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,spike,"Hey, class. Welcome to the Theory and Defense of Friendship."
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,gallus,Another sub? Let me start by telling you we don't get homework and we only do field trips.
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,spike,Yeeeeah. Nice try. Twilight sent me to tell you she won't be in today 'cause she has to cast a stone sleep spell on Rockhoof.
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,ocellus,Like Discord?! But why?! Rockhoof isn't a bad guy!
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,spike,"[""I don't know"" sound] Your instructions are to write an essay on heroism and what it means to you."
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,yona,No!
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,spike,"Oh, don't worry. It doesn't have to be a long essay."
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,rockhoof,"Maybe like this? Or on three legs? Hmm. What will give the wee birds fewer places to, uh... decorate?"
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,yona,Professor Rockhoof! Dragon said you want to turn into stone! Yona not believe it!
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,rockhoof,"Aye, I'm afraid it's true, lass."
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,yona,But... pony need finish ursa major story for class!
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,rockhoof,"Oh, it's sweet of you to try to get me to stay, Yona. But I'm afraid old stories like mine aren't worth anything in this day and age."
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,yona,"Fine! If pony no want tell Yona story, then Yona tell pony story! From class report! [reading] ""When Yona come to pony school, Yona not fit in. Pony ways strange. But Yona find friends! Yona meet Professor Rockhoof! Pony brave and strong as yak! Not afraid! Hero! When Yona grow up, Yona want to be just like Professor Rockhoof!"""
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,rockhoof,"Well, uh, since you went to the trouble of writing something that nice, I suppose the least I could do is tell you the rest of the story."
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,yona,Yona tell whole school Rockhoof is best! Now all want to hear story!
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,twilight sparkle,"Okay, I have the spell. But will you please reconsider? Rockhoof?"
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,rockhoof,The ursa major tried to grab me by the gullet! But I ducked her claws!
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,rockhoof,She had me cornered. So I look at her. She looks at me.
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,rockhoof,"And I say, ""Sorry you won't be having any dinner tonight, lass! Guess you'll just have to... grin and bear it!"""
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,rockhoof,And then I tossed her away with my shovel high into the sky! And she's been a constellation up there ever since! Or so I'm told. And that's the end of my story.
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,rockhoof,"No, no. Thank you for listening. But it's time to say goodbye."
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,twilight sparkle,Wait. You said there wasn't anything in this time you were good at. What about telling stories?
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,rockhoof,It was just a tall tale.
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,twilight sparkle,One that captured the hearts and imagination of everycreature here.
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,yona,"Plus, pony story super fun!"
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,twilight sparkle,"As the Princess of Friendship, I'd like to appoint you as Equestria's official keeper of tales!"
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,spike,Can you do that?
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,twilight sparkle,Eh.
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,rockhoof,"I, uh... That's very kind of you. But I still think these old bones are more suited to a museum display."
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,twilight sparkle,"You are a living record of our history. Your stories can inspire and teach generations to come. If you're a statue, that's all lost."
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,rockhoof,But will I ever really belong in your world?
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,yona,Rockhoof Yona's friend. So Rockhoof belongs!
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,rockhoof,"You know... That reminds me of another story. Once, there was a small yak that knew more than a great hero."
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,smolder,"Hey, don't forget the dragons in this one!"
A Rockhoof and a Hard Place,Kaita Mpambara,rockhoof,"Aye, there were dragons. And ponies. And plenty of Hippogriffs. Plus a changeling and a griffon..."
What Lies Beneath,Michael Vogel,twilight sparkle,"The Tree of Harmony remains one of the most powerful sources of magic known to ponydom. And though it has been at the ""root"" of magic and friendship from the moment it was planted, its ways are mysterious. Almost as if it has a mind of its own."
What Lies Beneath,Michael Vogel,smolder,Mind? [scoffs] It's a tree.
What Lies Beneath,Michael Vogel,twilight sparkle,A tree that grew a castle.
What Lies Beneath,Michael Vogel,silverstream,Was that before or after Discord made chocolate rain?
What Lies Beneath,Michael Vogel,cozy glow,[whispers] After.
What Lies Beneath,Michael Vogel,gallus,I'm never gonna learn pony history!
What Lies Beneath,Michael Vogel,twilight sparkle,"You can all show me what you've learned on tomorrow's test <U+0096> ""Friendship's Effect on the Course of Equestrian History""."
What Lies Beneath,Michael Vogel,twilight sparkle,Remember! Study groups are both fun and effective!
What Lies Beneath,Michael Vogel,sandbar,"So, who wants to study together?"
What Lies Beneath,Michael Vogel,gallus,"With other students? This is Equestria! If you want the real scoop, there's only one place to go. Hello, oh maaaaagical Equestrian tree! Can you tell me everything I need to know about friendship?"
What Lies Beneath,Michael Vogel,smolder,The Elements of Harmony grew the Tree?
What Lies Beneath,Michael Vogel,ocellus,No! The Pillars grew the Tree.
What Lies Beneath,Michael Vogel,sandbar,"The Tree grew the Elements, and then the box with six locks."
What Lies Beneath,Michael Vogel,ocellus,But our professors found six keys and unlocked the box.
What Lies Beneath,Michael Vogel,gallus,I'm so gonna fail.
What Lies Beneath,Michael Vogel,silverstream,You guys! Check this out!
What Lies Beneath,Michael Vogel,gallus,That's a plumbing diagram on how to fix a sink.
What Lies Beneath,Michael Vogel,sandbar,What does that have to do with Equestrian history?
What Lies Beneath,Michael Vogel,silverstream,Nothing. I just can't believe that's how sinks work! Where's Yona?
What Lies Beneath,Michael Vogel,smolder,"[laughs] Apparently, [imitating Yona] yaks no love study groups!"
What Lies Beneath,Michael Vogel,yona,[snoring] Spider! No!
What Lies Beneath,Michael Vogel,sandbar,"Hey, Cozy. What are you doing here?"
What Lies Beneath,Michael Vogel,cozy glow,"I volunteered to help Professor Sparkle organize these books. So, experts on Equestrian history yet?"
What Lies Beneath,Michael Vogel,gallus,I think I'd be better off studying the plumbing book. This stuff is impossible.
What Lies Beneath,Michael Vogel,ocellus,"Oh, come on, Gallus! With good friends and solid study habits, anything is possible!"
What Lies Beneath,Michael Vogel,smolder,"How about you just tell us what's on tomorrow's test, professor?"
What Lies Beneath,Michael Vogel,ocellus,"Now, hold on a sec. I can't give y'all a sneak peek. That there wouldn't be honest."
What Lies Beneath,Michael Vogel,cozy glow,"[clears throat] Golly, it's so inspiring how relaxed you all are about studying friendship, considering your disadvantage."
What Lies Beneath,Michael Vogel,yona,What cute pony mean?
What Lies Beneath,Michael Vogel,cozy glow,"Just consider where you all came from. If Sandbar hadn't sacrificed so much of his time to get you up to speed, who knows how behind you'd be?"
What Lies Beneath,Michael Vogel,sandbar,That's... not what<U+0097>
What Lies Beneath,Michael Vogel,cozy glow,"[to Ocellus] I mean, growing up as a love-starved changeling? [to Silverstream] Or hiding underwater from an evil king all those years? Trusting anycreature must be so hard for you. [to Gallus] And griffons never want to be around anycreature, even other griffons. [to Smolder] And dragons are so fierce compared to us. There must be days you can't wait to get away from all us cute ponies. [to Yona, imitating Yona] ""Everypony know yaks think yaks are best!"" Making friends with any other creature must seem like a step down. It's just so impressive how you keep trying to understand friendship, even though it isn't in your nature. Oh! I'll let you borrow my notes! It's what friends do. I'll be right back!"
What Lies Beneath,Michael Vogel,silverstream,We... should... get back to studying.
What Lies Beneath,Michael Vogel,gallus,Could you stop that clicking?! I'm trying to focus!
What Lies Beneath,Michael Vogel,sandbar,Dude!
What Lies Beneath,Michael Vogel,gallus,What? We have a test. I don't know every detail about every adventure the professors went on like you do.
What Lies Beneath,Michael Vogel,ocellus,That's why we're studying together.
What Lies Beneath,Michael Vogel,smolder,"Right. To help us ""disadvantaged"" creatures."
What Lies Beneath,Michael Vogel,yona,Yona confused. Why we all upset?
What Lies Beneath,Michael Vogel,silverstream,"I only glanced at that plumbing book, but I'm pretty sure this isn't supposed to be here."
What Lies Beneath,Michael Vogel,ocellus,What are you doing?
What Lies Beneath,Michael Vogel,smolder,Dragon. Strange magical cave. What do you think I'm doing?
What Lies Beneath,Michael Vogel,silverstream,Did we know this was down here?
What Lies Beneath,Michael Vogel,sandbar,I don't think anypony knows this is down here.
What Lies Beneath,Michael Vogel,sandbar,Headmare Twilight? Where are we?
What Lies Beneath,Michael Vogel,yona,"Uh, Yona confused."
What Lies Beneath,Michael Vogel,ocellus,"We were studying friendship's effect on history, but then..."
What Lies Beneath,Michael Vogel,gallus,"Since friendship just isn't in our nature, what's the point?"
What Lies Beneath,Michael Vogel,silverstream,"Our headmare is glowing, you guys. What is going on?!"
What Lies Beneath,Michael Vogel,ocellus,We should probably get back to studying for the test.
What Lies Beneath,Michael Vogel,sandbar,Huh?
What Lies Beneath,Michael Vogel,gallus,Huh?
What Lies Beneath,Michael Vogel,smolder,Huh?
What Lies Beneath,Michael Vogel,silverstream,Ooh!
What Lies Beneath,Michael Vogel,silverstream,Mount Aris? Headmare Twilight sent me home? Wait. Am I suspended? Hello? Anygriff here? Hmm. They must be topside.
What Lies Beneath,Michael Vogel,silverstream,The Storm King?! He's back?!
What Lies Beneath,Michael Vogel,gallus,Big room. No exits. Big deal.
What Lies Beneath,Michael Vogel,yona,Nothing for yaks to be afraid of. Just empty cave. Nothing in here can hurt<U+0097>
What Lies Beneath,Michael Vogel,yona,...Yona.
What Lies Beneath,Michael Vogel,smolder,Ugh. Things like this just don't happen in the Dragon Lands. Huh?
What Lies Beneath,Michael Vogel,smolder,No. On so many levels. No.
What Lies Beneath,Michael Vogel,smolder,Huh?
What Lies Beneath,Michael Vogel,ocellus,[gasps] Why do you look like that?
What Lies Beneath,Michael Vogel,ocellus,Not me.
What Lies Beneath,Michael Vogel,ocellus,"[whimpers, gasps] Nooooo!"
What Lies Beneath,Michael Vogel,sandbar,"[gasps] My first friendship adventure! Yes! Count me in! Oh, I've been waiting for this<U+0097> Wait! The others!"
What Lies Beneath,Michael Vogel,gallus,"Aah! Come on, Gallus. Get it together. Deep breaths. [inhaling and exhaling] Ah... Ahh... Achoo!"
What Lies Beneath,Michael Vogel,gallus,"[panicked whimpering] Okay. If this is a test, there's got to be a way out. It's just a puzzle... that will squash you if you don't figure it out."
What Lies Beneath,Michael Vogel,gallus,Oops.
What Lies Beneath,Michael Vogel,smolder,[groans] Look. I have to get out of here and find my friends. So just tell me what I have to do to pass this test. I'm not afraid of anything.
What Lies Beneath,Michael Vogel,smolder,"Just this once. [clears throat, cute voice] May I have some tea, please?"
What Lies Beneath,Michael Vogel,smolder,Okay. But let's keep this between us.
What Lies Beneath,Michael Vogel,yona,Huh?
What Lies Beneath,Michael Vogel,yona,Yona... no mean to scream. Yona love making friends. Spiders friends?
What Lies Beneath,Michael Vogel,yona,Wait. What little spider say?
What Lies Beneath,Michael Vogel,smolder,What happened to you?
What Lies Beneath,Michael Vogel,gallus,What happened to you?
What Lies Beneath,Michael Vogel,smolder,You never saw any of that. Got it?
What Lies Beneath,Michael Vogel,gallus,Maybe the others got out already and we're the last ones?
What Lies Beneath,Michael Vogel,smolder,"[sarcastic] Yeah, that totally seems like something they would do."
What Lies Beneath,Michael Vogel,gallus,[groans] Any other dragon or griffon would save themselves and get out of this crazy cave.
What Lies Beneath,Michael Vogel,smolder,Guess we aren't just any dragon or griffon anymore.
What Lies Beneath,Michael Vogel,gallus,Guess not. You go that way. I'll check over there.
What Lies Beneath,Michael Vogel,sandbar,Wait. I really should find my friends.
What Lies Beneath,Michael Vogel,smolder,Huh? Ocellus?
What Lies Beneath,Michael Vogel,ocellus,Go away.
What Lies Beneath,Michael Vogel,smolder,We're still in those weird caves beneath the school. We've gotta get out of here. [gasps] Chrysalis! Where's Ocellus?!
What Lies Beneath,Michael Vogel,gallus,Hello?!
What Lies Beneath,Michael Vogel,gallus,Where are<U+0097>? Whoa!
What Lies Beneath,Michael Vogel,silverstream,Shhhh! The Storm King will hear you!
What Lies Beneath,Michael Vogel,gallus,The Storm King? He was defeated. We're still under the school. This is all just some crazy test.
What Lies Beneath,Michael Vogel,gallus,"Okay, that's horrifying."
What Lies Beneath,Michael Vogel,silverstream,I can't find any Hippogriffs or seaponies. They must all be captured! Gallus! Get back down here!
What Lies Beneath,Michael Vogel,gallus,It's not real.
What Lies Beneath,Michael Vogel,silverstream,"Yes, it is! He's back, and I'm never gonna see another sunset or fly through a cloud bank or study plumbing! He's gonna take away everything I love! I'm gonna be trapped down here forever!"
What Lies Beneath,Michael Vogel,gallus,"I'm afraid of being trapped, too! I'm scared of small spaces."
What Lies Beneath,Michael Vogel,silverstream,Really?
What Lies Beneath,Michael Vogel,gallus,"Yeah. And I was stuck in a room that kept shrinking. But I realized I had to face my fear, and I found the way out. This is your test. He isn't really here."
What Lies Beneath,Michael Vogel,silverstream,But what if he is?
What Lies Beneath,Michael Vogel,gallus,Then tell him exactly what you think of him.
What Lies Beneath,Michael Vogel,silverstream,Ha-ha! I did it! I told him!
What Lies Beneath,Michael Vogel,gallus,Okay. Heh. Hug time later. W-We still have to get back to the library.
What Lies Beneath,Michael Vogel,smolder,You're a changeling. Just change back.
What Lies Beneath,Michael Vogel,ocellus,I can't.
What Lies Beneath,Michael Vogel,ocellus,"Maybe my past was so horrible, it's still inside me just waiting to come out again."
What Lies Beneath,Michael Vogel,smolder,That's ridiculous. That's not who you are anymore. You've changed.
What Lies Beneath,Michael Vogel,ocellus,Maybe we can't really change that much.
What Lies Beneath,Michael Vogel,smolder,"[muffled] I like cute, silly stuff."
What Lies Beneath,Michael Vogel,ocellus,"I'm sorry, what?"
What Lies Beneath,Michael Vogel,smolder,"I like cute, silly stuff! But ever since school started, I've realized that sometimes I kinda don't mind cute stuff."
What Lies Beneath,Michael Vogel,smolder,"If a dragon like me can admit she likes tea parties, that's proof we can change. I was gonna invite you to a top-secret tea party with me, but if you want to stay down here..."
What Lies Beneath,Michael Vogel,ocellus,Oh! No! I want to come!
What Lies Beneath,Michael Vogel,smolder,"I thought that might work. Come on, let's go!"
What Lies Beneath,Michael Vogel,silverstream,Where's Yona and Sandbar?
What Lies Beneath,Michael Vogel,gallus,The way out is closing!
What Lies Beneath,Michael Vogel,smolder,We aren't leaving without them!
What Lies Beneath,Michael Vogel,yona,Yona find you guys!
What Lies Beneath,Michael Vogel,silverstream,"Hey, Yona. Who's your... spider army?"
What Lies Beneath,Michael Vogel,yona,Yona always scared of spiders. But then Yona meet Spindle.
What Lies Beneath,Michael Vogel,yona,Yona realize no reason to be afraid. Spiders and yak friends! So Yona ask new friends to help finding old friends!
What Lies Beneath,Michael Vogel,gallus,Do you think your new friends can help us find Sandbar?
What Lies Beneath,Michael Vogel,smolder,"Of all the strange things that have happened tonight, that's the strangest, right?"
What Lies Beneath,Michael Vogel,sandbar,"Okay, enough! I'm not going anywhere without my friends!"
What Lies Beneath,Michael Vogel,sandbar,"I've always looked up to you. You would never turn your back on each other, and that's what makes you strong. Now I have a group of friends that I think is every bit as amazing as yours. If I have to give up on them to make you proud, then you aren't the ponies I thought you were. I don't care if I disappoint you. You disappoint me."
What Lies Beneath,Michael Vogel,silverstream,Did you just tell our professors you were disappointed in them?
What Lies Beneath,Michael Vogel,sandbar,"Something tells me those weren't actually our professors. Besides, they tried to get between me and my friends."
What Lies Beneath,Michael Vogel,smolder,"That's all very sweet. Now, can we please get out of here?!"
What Lies Beneath,Michael Vogel,sandbar,"[grunting] You! You're not Headmare Twilight, are you?"
What Lies Beneath,Michael Vogel,ocellus,[gasps] You're the Tree of Harmony!
What Lies Beneath,Michael Vogel,silverstream,The Tree of Harmony turned into a sparkly version of our headmare to talk to us? Did I miss a chapter in class?
What Lies Beneath,Michael Vogel,gallus,I'm a bit rusty on pony history. But since when does the Tree of Harmony trap creatures in a cave with their biggest fears?!
What Lies Beneath,Michael Vogel,sandbar,[gasps] Our friendship got us past our fears!
What Lies Beneath,Michael Vogel,gallus,"W-We just learned a friendship lesson from a tree, didn't we?"
What Lies Beneath,Michael Vogel,cozy glow,You're all right! I came back with my notes and saw this and didn't know what to think!
What Lies Beneath,Michael Vogel,silverstream,We're better than all right! We just got tested by the Tree of Harmony! And we totally passed!
What Lies Beneath,Michael Vogel,cozy glow,The Tree of Harmony? Here?
What Lies Beneath,Michael Vogel,silverstream,"Yeah! Well, below here. Under the school! We found this and went down and met the Tree, and Gallus was all, [imitating Gallus] ""Friendship is not in our nature."" And the Tree was like, ""Whaaaaat?!"" And it tested us!"
What Lies Beneath,Michael Vogel,smolder,"Long story short, friendship is in our nature. The Tree said so."
What Lies Beneath,Michael Vogel,ocellus,I guess we should tell somepony there's a giant magical hole in the library.
What Lies Beneath,Michael Vogel,ocellus,Or not.
What Lies Beneath,Michael Vogel,sandbar,We have to tell our professors about this! They won't believe that<U+0097>!
What Lies Beneath,Michael Vogel,cozy glow,You can't!
What Lies Beneath,Michael Vogel,yona,Why no?
What Lies Beneath,Michael Vogel,cozy glow,"Because... it's my fault. You were all getting along so well, and I felt left out. I was jealous. And it upset you so much, the Tree of Harmony had to test you. [gasps] Oh! I'm gonna get expelled for sure! [crying] Please don't tell anypony about this! Especially the professors! Please, please, please<U+0097>!"
What Lies Beneath,Michael Vogel,smolder,Okay! [yawns] I'm actually too tired to do anything right now.
What Lies Beneath,Michael Vogel,sandbar,"Yeah, but we can't go to sleep. We'll miss the test."
What Lies Beneath,Michael Vogel,gallus,[yawns] The test! I almost forgot!
What Lies Beneath,Michael Vogel,ocellus,[yawns] We're all gonna fail.
What Lies Beneath,Michael Vogel,cozy glow,"What if I tell Professor Sparkle I needed help organizing these books, and you were all kind enough to pitch in? I'll get you an extension!"
What Lies Beneath,Michael Vogel,sandbar,"[yawns] Thanks, Cozy. That's nice of you."
What Lies Beneath,Michael Vogel,cozy glow,I'm just so sorry I caused all of this. You're such good friends. I'm sorry I ever doubted you.
What Lies Beneath,Michael Vogel,cozy glow,You get some rest. Don't give any of this another thought. Just let Cozy take care of everything.
Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,twilight sparkle,I can't believe you two are going on a friendship quest! This is amazing!
Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,applejack,"What do you mean, Twilight? We've been on one together before."
Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,twilight sparkle,Exactly! This is the first time the map has teamed up the same ponies for a second quest!
Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,fluttershy,That is special.
Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,applejack,Heh. Must be 'cause we're extra good at solvin' friendship problems.
Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,twilight sparkle,"I hope so, 'cause it looks like this one might be a little tricky. You're going to the Peaks of Peril."
Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,fluttershy,The Peaks of... P-P-Peril?!
Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,applejack,"Aw, it's just a name. It doesn't mean anythin'."
Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,fluttershy,Like how Cloudsdale is in the clouds and the Crystal Empire's made of crystal?
Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,applejack,"Fair point. So, what can ya tell us about the place, Twilight?"
Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,twilight sparkle,"Only what Rockhoof told me. Back in his day, nopony knew much about the Peaks of Peril except for the legend on this ancient shield. It says a group called the Kirin used to live there, known for their kindness and truth-speaking."
Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,applejack,Now we know why the Map called us.
Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,twilight sparkle,"Unfortunately, other creatures also lived there. The Nirik, fearsome beasts of pure fire."
Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,twilight sparkle,"Sorry, Fluttershy. Flanks don't lie."
Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,applejack,"Aw, I'm sure the two of us'll get that friendship problem solved, no matter what kind o' creature has it."
Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,applejack,Guess nopony else is goin' out as far as we are.
Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,fluttershy,Maybe they know something we don't?
Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,applejack,"Now, Fluttershy, I've told you a dozen times. There's nothin' to be sca<U+0097>"
Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,fluttershy,[screams] You really startled us.
Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,applejack,We get the picture. Why?
Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,applejack,"Well, maybe there's a little somethin' to be scared of."
Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,applejack,Yah!
Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,fluttershy,There. That should be enough flowers to keep your tree cozy.
Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,applejack,"Fluttershy! What are you doin'?! This is no time for visitin' varmints! We're on a friendship quest, remember?!"
Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,fluttershy,"Yes, but actua<U+0097>"
Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,applejack,Come on! We're burnin' daylight!
Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,fluttershy,"I know, but what I found out is that<U+0097>"
Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,applejack,"Now, we gotta get up that peak! I figure if we use some rope and elbow grease, we can make it up half<U+0097>"
Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,fluttershy,Applejack! Can you please listen to me?! [clears throat] What I'm trying to say is the squirrels told me a shortcut they take to the Kirin village.
Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,applejack,"Oh. [chuckles] Sorry, Fluttershy. I suppose I got a little too caught up in the adventure."
Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,fluttershy,"That's all right. If you hadn't come back to get me, I probably would've talked to the squirrels all day. Heh."
Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,applejack,Show yourself!
Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,applejack,"Well, hi. I'm Applejack, and this here's Fluttershy."
Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,fluttershy,"If you have any friendship problems, we're here to help."
Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,applejack,"Huh. [to Fluttershy] Quiet bunch, ain't they? [clears throat] We're from Equestria, and we're plumb tickled to meet y'all."
Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,applejack,"S-So, uh... what are your names?"
Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,applejack,[stressing] Ap-ple-jack! Flut-ter-shy! Remember?
Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,fluttershy,"[whispering, to Applejack] Maybe they don't understand us."
Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,applejack,[stressing] Do. You. Un-der-stand. Ponish?
Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,fluttershy,Oh! But you don't speak?
Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,applejack,Don't or won't?
Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,fluttershy,"Will you excuse us for a moment? [to Applejack] You have to ask yes-or-no questions, or they won't answer."
Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,applejack,Like talkin' to Angel Bunny?
Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,fluttershy,Not exactly. I can always tell what Angel is feeling. But these Kirin don't show anything.
Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,applejack,"Well, how are we gonna solve a friendship problem if none of 'em will tell us what it is?"
Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,applejack,"These Kirin are quieter than an apple blossom on snowfall. Still, there's gotta be some way to make 'em speak. [chuckles] Beautiful day, ain't it?"
Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,applejack,"[whinny] Knock, knock! Now you say, ""Who's there?"""
Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,applejack,"Police. ""Police who?"" Police [please] say somethin'!"
Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,applejack,Uh-oh! I feel a sneeze comin' on! Aaaa-CHOOOOO!
Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,fluttershy,Gesundheit.
Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,applejack,[groans] Don't any o' y'all talk?!
Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,applejack,Now we're gettin' somewhere.
Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,fluttershy,A dark spooky path that leads into unknown territory?
Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,applejack,"Tell you what, sugarcube. You stay and see if you can get anythin' outta these here Kirin. I'll go and try to find one that talks."
Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,fluttershy,Phew! Be careful. And watch out for Niriks!
Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,applejack,[yelps] Phew! [yelps] Oh. Have you seen a Kirin that talks?
Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,applejack,Any idea where I should look?
Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,applejack,"Oh, for the love of Celestia! Can't ya just say somethin'?!"
Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,applejack,"That... was somethin', all right."
Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,applejack,"Oh, wow. [gasps] This... is amazin'."
Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,applejack,I was gonna say it's pretty. But yeah.
Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,applejack,Whoa there. Vow of silence?
Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,applejack,"I hope it's not a sore subject, but... you mind explainin' why y'all went quiet in the first place?"
Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,applejack,[sighs] You'd rather not talk about it?
Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,applejack,I-I under<U+0097>
Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,applejack,[gasps] I can't believe it! Nopony should give up feelin'... their feelin's just to keep from gettin' angry!
Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,applejack,[gasps] I bet this here's the problem that Fluttershy and I came to help y'all with!
Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,applejack,"Right... Well, I'm thinkin' if we just go talk to the other Kirin, we can get 'em to welcome you back proper-like. Maybe even convince 'em to take your cure."
Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,applejack,There's no cure left?!
Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,applejack,"[sighs] Well, this wouldn't be a friendship quest if it was easy. I'm gonna start by gettin' your friends to welcome you back!"
Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,applejack,[panting] Fluttershy! Guess what!
Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,applejack,Bet that's a problem the Kirin never have.
Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,fluttershy,[giggles] No.
Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,applejack,"Anyhow, we gotta get 'em all talkin' again."
Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,fluttershy,"Oh, no-no-no-no-no! We can't ever let that happen!"
Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,applejack,I thought you said you figured out the friendship problem. Was somethin' lost in translation?
Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,fluttershy,"The Kirin are usually peaceful and kind. But when they get mad, they turn into Niriks, creatures made of fire and vengeance!"
Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,applejack,Heh. That seemed less scary when it was in a song.
Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,fluttershy,"The last time they all argued, they got so angry, they accidentally destroyed their whole village. So the Kirin decided to make sure it would never happen again."
Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,applejack,But that's no reason to stop talkin'.
Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,fluttershy,"Yes, it is! Fire is dangerous, especially in a forest like this. Why, think of all the animals it could hurt."
Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,applejack,Not if they don't turn into fire-breathin' Nirik in the first place.
Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,fluttershy,And how can you be sure that won't happen?
Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,applejack,There's gotta be a better way than givin' up all your feelin's!
Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,fluttershy,Applejack! You're not listening!
Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,applejack,'Cause you're not talkin' any sense!
Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,fluttershy,"Um, what are they doing?"
Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,fluttershy,[grunts] Maybe they got worried because we were arguing with each other.
Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,applejack,"Aw, shucks! We were just havin' a normal, civil disagreement! Honest!"
Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,applejack,"To the Stream of Silence! If we hit that water, we'll never be able to talk or feel anythin' ever again!"
Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,applejack,It's all right. I think I know this one. And she's tryin' to help.
Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,fluttershy,She talks?
Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,applejack,"You have no idea. Fluttershy, meet Autumn Blaze."
Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,fluttershy,"Well, thank you for that... um, wall of fire. But I thought Niriks were dangerous when they're angry. How did you know you could control your temper?"
Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,applejack,And givin' up happiness to keep away anger is no kind o' life.
Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,fluttershy,I never thought of it that way. I can't imagine not being able to talk to my animal friends.
Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,applejack,I know you're worried about fightin'. But friends can disagree without causin' a ruckus.
Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,fluttershy,Everypony gets mad sometimes. Even Applejack and I argue.
Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,applejack,What?! When do we ever argue?
Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,fluttershy,[clears throat] On the way here? And about the Kirin being silent? And right now!
Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,applejack,We don't always see eye-to-eye. But we never let that get in the way of our friendship.
Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,fluttershy,"And if you're really angry, then take some time away to be a Nirik where it won't hurt anypony."
Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,applejack,I-I think they're tryin' to say somethin'.
Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,fluttershy,"That's wonderful! Uh, isn't it?"
Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,applejack,"Well, it would be. Except there aren't any flowers left to make the cure."
Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,fluttershy,Are you sure?
Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,fluttershy,Hmm. I wish she'd told us what kind of flowers she's looking for.
Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,applejack,They're called foal's-breath.
Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,fluttershy,I've never heard of that.
Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,applejack,"Uh, Fluttershy? A little help?"
Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,fluttershy,[gasps] He says he knows where to find more foal's-breath!
Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,applejack,"Well, what are we waitin' for? Lead the way!"
Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,fluttershy,[gasps] That's what foal's-breath looks like?!
Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,applejack,Autumn Blaze never would've made it past the Peaks to search here. I owe you an apology.
Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,fluttershy,Why?
Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,applejack,"'Cause if your kindness hadn't made you stop to help the squirrels, we never would've found this here flower."
Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,fluttershy,"And if your honesty hadn't convinced the Kirin to talk, we wouldn't need to find it."
Sounds of Silence,Gregory Bonsignore,applejack,"[chuckles] Guess it's a good thing the map sent both of us, huh?"
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,Woo-hoo-hoo!
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,spike,Whoa! Ta-da!
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"Okay, Spike. Now let's try a flip. Remember <U+0096> two flaps, then straight up!"
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,spike,Got it!
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"You're doing great, Spike. Now let's see the big finish!"
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,spike,Whoa-oa-oa-oa!
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,spike,"[grunts] I don't know about ""big"", but I am definitely finished."
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,Maybe I should get Rainbow Dash. She's the one who taught me advanced flying techniques.
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,spike,"No, thanks. If I'm gonna mess up, I'd rather do it in front of you. I just don't understand why none of your advice is helping."
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,smolder,Because she's teaching you to fly like a pony instead of a dragon.
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,spike,What's the difference?
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,smolder,"Well, we don't have feathers, for starters."
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,spike,Ye-he-he-hes!
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,spike,Wow! Thank you so much! How did you know I just needed to bend my wings?
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,smolder,"Honestly, this is Dragon 101. Usually dragon parents teach this stuff."
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"Spike, I've been thinking about our flying lesson."
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,spike,Uh-huh...
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"I can't believe I overlooked something as simple as feathers. It's no wonder you were having trouble. I wish I had more ""dragonish"" knowledge to give you. Do you think being raised by ponies has affected you in other ways? Spike?"
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,spike,"Did you say something, Twilight? Sorry. I'm just finishing up this ""thank-you"" throw pillow for Smolder. And you know how I get when I'm in the embroidery zone."
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,spike,It's a pillow! But not for your head. Although it could be. It's a throw pillow. They're more casual. You can use 'em anywhere. You don't like it.
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,smolder,"Uh, it's not that. It's just dragons don't really use pillows. At all."
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,spike,What?
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,smolder,"Hey, what's that?"
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,spike,I don't know. But it's... heading right for us!
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,spike,Okay. Now I really owe you for the lesson.
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,spike,You all right?
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,smolder,Yeah. What happened?
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,sludge,To what?
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,sludge,Ow...
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,spike,Maybe not. But you're hurt and need help. So I'm taking you to Twilight's castle whether you like it or not?
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"I'm glad Spike brought you here, Sludge. I understand you made quite the impression in town."
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,pinkie pie,Literally! There's a hole and everything!
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,applejack,It doesn't look like you're in much shape to do anything.
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,rarity,"Darling, do be careful."
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,sludge,I'm... [groans] ...fine.
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,fluttershy,I can't watch!
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,rainbow dash,"You're not the first stubborn dragon we've met, you know?"
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,spike,"And sometimes, even dragons need help."
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,I promise. My friends and I will only do enough to get you back on your claws.
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"I know you had your reservations, but it's good to see you feeling better."
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,sludge,"T-Thanks, I guess."
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,rarity,"That's what friends are for, darling."
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,sludge,"You're pretty lucky to have friends like these, kid."
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,spike,"Actually, I was orphaned as an egg, and Twilight raised me. So these ponies are more than my friends. They're my family."
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"We try our best, but sometimes I worry that maybe Spike is..."
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,spike,Missing something deep down and dragonish.
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,sludge,Really? Wow. I-I can't tell you how glad I am to hear that.
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,applejack,Why in Equestria would you be glad to hear that?
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,sludge,"I wasn't gonna say anything since your life seemed so perfect, but I have a confession to make. Coming to Ponyville wasn't an accident. I was looking for you. Spike... [sighs] I'm your father."
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,pinkie pie,[continues gasping] Sorry.
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,So you crashed in Ponyville on purpose?
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,sludge,"Well, the crash part wasn't on purpose, but heading here was. I've been searching everywhere for you, kid."
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,spike,Did you ask in the Crystal Empire? I'm kind of well-known there.
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,pinkie pie,"Actually, Spike's well-known everywhere. Not a lot of dragons were hatched by the Princess of Friendship."
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,applejack,Mm-hmm.
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,sludge,[choked up] You make it sound so simple. I wish you'd been there to help me search.
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,spike,I can't believe it. I have so many questions.
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,sludge,"Well, ask away. Answering questions is what dads are for."
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,spike,I guess my biggest question is simple. Why was I an orphaned egg?
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,sludge,[stammers] You sure you don't want to ask something else? [choked up] It's a lot of painful memories. [sighs] Your mother was the best dragon I'd ever met.
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,sludge,"[voiceover] The Dragon Lord even picked her to scout for the Great Migration, and-and even though she just laid your egg, we knew she'd have to go. But finding the Migration route could take a lifetime, and you deserved a chance to know your mother. So I went looking for you, carrying your egg to places no dragon or pony has ever been. Past Mount Aris, the abandoned home of the Hippogriffs..."
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,pinkie pie,Ooh! Did you visit Klugetown?
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,sludge,You've been to Klugetown?
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"Also, the Hippogriffs returned to Mount Aris after we helped them defeat the Storm King."
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,sludge,"Oh, well, have you heard of the Land of the... Scale Collectors?"
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,Uh-uh.
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,sludge,[to Spike] Because that's where your mother's trail finally led.
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,sludge,"[voiceover] To a prison world of dragon hunters, where I was forced to choose between surrendering myself or surrendering your egg."
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,sludge,"[voiceover, choked up] Of course, there was no way I was gonna sacrifice my boy. So they took me instead, and that's where I'd been ever since."
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,sludge,Locked up somewhere not even the Princess of Friendship has heard of.
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,spike,Whoa... How did you know I was a boy?
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,fluttershy,Whatever happened to Spike's mom?
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,rainbow dash,And how did the egg make it all the way back to Equestria by itself?
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,pinkie pie,Hmm?
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,spike,"Well, that's all in the past. The only thing that matters now is that we're together. And I'm gonna make up for lost time."
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,spike,"I hope you don't mind, but I have a list of all the things I always wanted to do with my dad?"
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,sludge,"Mind? Spike, my boy, with you by my side, I feel like we could do anything. What do you want to do first?"
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,spike,"Well, I've kind of been working on a list for a long time."
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,sludge,"Dude, you want to do all of this?"
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,spike,"Oh. I mean, w-we don't have to."
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,sludge,"If you think doing everything on this incredibly long list is gonna fill the hole where your dragonishness should be, then that is exactly what we're gonna do!"
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,pinkie pie,Woo-hoo!
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,spike,"Oh, yeah!"
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,spike,I can't believe we got so many things done. But this is all my stuff. Is there anything you always wanted to do with me?
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,sludge,Not really.
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,sludge,"Uhhh, I mean, uh, I'm happy to do whatever you want. But if I had a castle like this with all this stuff, I'd probably just lay around all day doing nothing like a real dragon."
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,spike,Like a real dragon?
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,sludge,Sure! I'm not surprised you don't know any better. Twilight basically raised you as a pony. You're barely a dragon at all.
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,spike,Huh?
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"Hey, Spike! How are things going with Sludge?"
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,spike,"Honestly, I thought having him around would make me feel more dragonish. But I kind of feel less."
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"Oh, I'm sorry. I wish I could help."
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,sludge,"Awww, shucks. [chewing noisily] I guess I shouldn't have said anything about you being more pony than dragon. I just wish we had more in common."
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"Maybe you two can come up with ways to turn up Spike's, uh, dragonishness."
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,spike,You think that's something we can do?
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,sludge,"You know what, son? I think it is!"
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,sludge,"Spike, I'm gonna teach you a thing or two about being a dragon. So, listen up, my boy, because I'm only gonna say this once."
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,spike,"It's pretty sweet, right?"
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,sludge,You can't be a dragon here
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,spike,"Uh, I can't?"
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,sludge,Look at these books up on the wall
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,spike,"Hey, I just finished organizing those!"
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,sludge,"This treasure pile's not right, I fear"
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,spike,What do I do?
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,sludge,"Just grab it all and give to me After that, then you'll be free You just can't be a dragon heeeeere!"
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,spike,Ha! You're right! I feel better already!
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,sludge,"See? What did I tell you? You're very lucky that I found you. Now, go get me some more."
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,spike,You got it! I'm gonna go get you all the cushy pony stuff I've got... Dad.
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,sludge,Great! Go get 'em... son!
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,Spike? I just thought I'd check to see if you and Sludge had any luck turning up your dragonishness. It's hard not to feel like somehow I let you down all these years.
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,Oh! I'm so sorry! I didn't mean to barge in on ya!
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,sludge,"[grunts, sighs] Ah, don't worry about it. Mi castle es su castle."
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"Right. Well, I'll just get out of your way."
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,Oh! Spike! I'm so sorry. My morning is not going well. What is all this? Why'd you leave the castle so early?
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,spike,I didn't leave. I spent the night outdoors to get in touch with my dragon side.
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,Outdoors?
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,spike,Yeah! And Sludge asked me to bring him the best breakfast Ponyville has to offer so he can show me how a real dragon would eat it. See you later!
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,...And that's why I thought we could use the map to<U+0097>
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,spike,"Hey, gang! Dad was just showing me how a real dragon would act in a throne room."
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,sludge,"Dragons like to sprawl when they get their claws done. [blows] Now, if you'll all excuse me, it's time for my bath."
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,spike,[sighs] Isn't he the best?
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,rarity,I'm not sure that's exactly the word I would use.
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,sludge,"Uh, Spike? The bath isn't gonna fill itself, son."
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,spike,Be right there... Dad.
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,I'm glad you're not spending the night outside again.
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,spike,"Oh, I am. I'm just looking for a good bedtime story to read to my dad first."
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,It's nice that you have somepony to show you dragon culture. But are you sure that's what Sludge is doing?
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,spike,What do you mean?
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"Well, taking over your room, making a mess of things..."
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,spike,[scoffs] That is dragon culture.
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,You never acted like that.
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,spike,That's because you raised me. Now I finally have a chance to see how I'm supposed to be.
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,I don't think you're supposed to be any different than who you are.
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,spike,Maybe you just don't like that I have a real parent now.
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,That's not true! I'm glad Sludge is here. I-I just wish he wasn't such a<U+0097>
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,spike,"Dragon? Of all ponies, I can't believe you would have a problem with that."
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,smolder,What happened to you?
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,spike,Just sleeping outside like we're meant to. It's not like dragons are supposed to live in castles.
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,smolder,I... guess not. But I live in the school. Nothing says we have to live outside.
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,spike,"[sighs] I'm so confused. It's been great having Sludge show me how to be a real dragon, but Twilight just doesn't get it."
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,smolder,What do you mean?
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,spike,"She can't handle how good at being a dragon Sludge is. Maybe someday, I'll be able to lay around doing nothing as well as he does."
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,smolder,What?
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,spike,"Well, not now, of course. I'm too busy bringing him pony stuff so he can show me what a dragon would do with it."
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,smolder,"So, Sludge just lays around while you wait on him claw and tail? Uh, dragons are rude and rebellious, but they aren't lazy lumps who take advantage of their kids."
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,spike,Huh. Now I'm really confused.
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,smolder,"Me, too. Why don't you tell me everything Sludge said about being a dragon?"
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,sludge,"[chewing noisily] Hey! What's going on, son?"
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,spike,"Twilight doesn't like having real dragons in the castle, so I told her we're moving out."
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,sludge,[coughs] You what?!
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,smolder,Spike! I found the perfect cave where you two can live! There aren't even any comfortable rocks inside!
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,spike,That does sound perfect!
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,sludge,"No, it doesn't! I-I-I mean, uh, I'm not sure I fully demonstrated all the ways a dragon would live here."
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,spike,"But we're not gonna live here anymore, so it doesn't matter."
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,sludge,It matters to me! [stammers] I want to make sure you have all the knowledge you need.
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,spike,"But I do. Dad, you've already shared so much. [singing] This bed is much too soft Just take that silk robe off We can't be dragons living here"
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,sludge,Stop! I'm not your father!
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,spike,What?
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,sludge,I just said that to get in on this sweet castle life.
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,spike,So... you... pretended to be my dad?
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,sludge,"Now-now-now-now-now, don't look at me like that, kid. I did what any dragon would do."
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,smolder,No. You didn't.
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,sludge,"Hey. I saw an opportunity, and I took it. That's what dragons do."
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,smolder,No. It isn't.
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,sludge,You know what? I don't need this. I'm out of here! Enjoy lovin' pony town!
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,sludge,I'm taking this pillow.
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,spike,I can't believe I thought somepony like that could show me how to be anything.
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,smolder,Uh... it must be hard growing up not really knowing who you are.
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,spike,That's the thing. I know exactly who I am. And how I got that way.
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,spike,"Um, Twilight?"
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,Oh. Hi. Where's your father?
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,spike,He's gone. Turns out he wasn't what a real dragon should be after all. He also wasn't my real dad.
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"Oh, Spike. I'm so sorry."
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,spike,"I'm the one who's sorry. You were just worried about me, and I lost my temper. Sludge was just a great big phony."
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"I have to say, I'm not surprised. There's no way a dragon like that was related to you. But if you still want to search for your real family, I'd understand if you spent more time in the Dragon Lands."
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,spike,I don't think so. I already know who my real family is.
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"Aww! It's me, right?"
Father Knows Beast,Josh Haber,spike,"Mm-hmm! Besides, there's no way I'm living without pillows."
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,cozy glow,Thank you for the mail delivery. Have a wonderful day!
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,cozy glow,"You're new here, right? I'm Cozy Glow, Professor Sparkle's friendship assistant. Welcome to our school! Your first class is just down that hall."
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,cozy glow,"A seven-letter word for ""teamwork"". Have you tried ""synergy""?"
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,silverstream,"That's it! Thanks, Cozy!"
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,cozy glow,What are friends for?
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,cozy glow,"Good morning, Professor Sparkle!"
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,cozy glow,Don't worry. I asked Professor Rainbow Dash to cover for you.
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,twilight sparkle,And she said yes?
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,cozy glow,Uh-huh. I told her how busy you are and how much her loyalty meant to you. I also color-coded your teaching schedule by friendship element and catalogued all the magical artifacts in the school. I hope that's okay.
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,twilight sparkle,"Okay? Cozy, that's amazing! You're like my right-hoof pony! I don't know what I'd do without you."
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,cozy glow,[giggles] It's like you taught me. Helping is what friendship's all about.
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,twilight sparkle,Exactly. And hopefully my class is learning that on their field trip right now.
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,cozy glow,I heard they might do some sightseeing first.
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,rainbow dash,Ta-da! The Pegasus Weather Factory! Every drop of rain or flake of snow from Cloudsdale comes from there.
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,rainbow dash,"I know, right? Hey! The cool stuff's over here!"
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,ocellus,Wow! I've never stood on a cloud before!
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,starlight glimmer,"You can't normally. But for our trip, I cast a spell that lets us walk like Pegasi."
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,gallus,"Hey, Yona! Come check out this view! Unless you're too scared."
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,yona,[teeth chattering] Yona not scared! [screams] Now Yona scared!
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,rainbow dash,Come on! We gotta catch 'em!
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,gallus,Gotcha!
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,ocellus,"It's okay, Yona! You like flying, remember?"
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,yona,"Flying, not falling!"
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,starlight glimmer,I don't understand. It-It's like my spell stopped working. That's... never happened before.
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,starlight glimmer,We have an emergency!
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,rainbow dash,The students dropped out of the sky!
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,twilight sparkle,Slow down. What happened?
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,starlight glimmer,"I cast a spell for our field trip to Cloudsdale, but my magic just failed."
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,rainbow dash,We barely caught everypony in time!
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,twilight sparkle,"I'm glad you're all okay, but I'm sure it's nothing to worry about, Starlight. Maybe you did your spell wrong. Let's take a look."
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,twilight sparkle,I didn't drop that book.
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,starlight glimmer,[sarcastically] Maybe you did your spell wrong?
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,rarity,Ow!
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,fluttershy,Rarity ran into the door.
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,rarity,[sobbing] My magic is go-o-o-one! I even had to use my hooves to coif my tail!
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,rainbow dash,Still think there's nothing to worry about?
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,twilight sparkle,This doesn't make any sense. Magic can't just disappear. Something has to be causing this.
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,cozy glow,"Um, didn't we learn in class about a creature that eats magic? Ter, Tee... Tir-something?"
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,fluttershy,[gasps] Tirek!
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,rainbow dash,Isn't he trapped in Tartarus?
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,twilight sparkle,"Spike, what's wrong?"
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,spike,"[gagging, belches, sighs] Thanks. I've never had a letter get stuck before. It's from Princess Celestia! We've all been called to an emergency meeting in Canterlot! Look!"
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,twilight sparkle,Pretty sure I know what it's about.
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,princess celestia,"Throughout our city, ponies have been reporting tales of their magic failing. Spells going wrong. Potions not working."
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,princess luna,Even raising the moon has become difficult. Are there similar troubles in Ponyville?
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,twilight sparkle,We experienced it first-hoof.
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,princess cadance,"It's the same in my kingdom. The Crystal Heart seems safe for now, but I worry if this continues."
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,princess celestia,Ah! It is even more terrible than we feared! Magic is disappearing all across Equestria!
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,princess celestia,"Star Swirl believes the power will drain from our land in three days. First, unicorn magic and spells will fail."
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,starlight glimmer,That's what's happening now.
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,princess celestia,"On the second day, creatures will lose their magic abilities."
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,fluttershy,"[gasps] Oh, no!"
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,princess celestia,"And finally, magical artifacts will stop working. When the sun sets on the third day, the magic in our world will be gone forever!"
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,princess cadance,But why is this happening now?
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,princess luna,That's the worst part. We have no idea.
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,twilight sparkle,Has anypony checked on Tirek?
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,pinkie pie,"You mean the big, red, scary centaur who eats magic? Why would we wa<U+0097> Ohhhh. Riiiiight."
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,princess celestia,"If he has found some way to escape his prison or work from within it, he could be responsible for this."
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,princess luna,That is the best explanation so far. Somepony should investigate.
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,twilight sparkle,We'll go.
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,rarity,"Oh, no-no-no-no-no-no. Not without us, you wo<U+0097> Wait. Did you say ""we""?"
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,twilight sparkle,"I've finally learned that it's okay to count on your friends for help. Um, you do want to come, right?"
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,rainbow dash,"Uh, duh!"
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,princess celestia,"Thank you, all. We will search for ways to protect Equestria in your absence."
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,princess luna,"Be careful. Tartarus has changed since you were there. It now holds many dangerous creatures, and you won't be able to rely on your magic."
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,applejack,"With her friends by her side, she won't have to."
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,twilight sparkle,"Okay. I left you my lesson plan, all my student files, and my annotated syllabus notes. If anything goes wrong, get Celestia."
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,starlight glimmer,Got it!
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,twilight sparkle,Maybe I should just close the school and send my students home.
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,starlight glimmer,[sighs] Would you go save Equestria already?
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,spike,Okay. Cozy packed us all up for a trip to bad guy central.
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,cozy glow,"Don't forget the sandwiches. I marked whose is whose, just in case. [whispering, to Spike] Starlight can't stand mustard."
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,starlight glimmer,"That's so sweet of you, Cozy. But Twilight has asked me to stay here to run the school."
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,cozy glow,Oh. I thought that after what happened last time<U+0097>
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,spike,"Once she's survived Discord, anything else is a piece of cake."
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,twilight sparkle,"Plus, she'll have you to help her."
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,cozy glow,"Oh, golly, yes! I promise I'll be the best assistant ever! Come on. We can start working on your substitute headmare plans right now, if you like."
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,starlight glimmer,"Wow. Uh, okay."
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,twilight sparkle,See? Nothing to worry about. Tell me there's nothing to worry about.
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,cozy glow,"Good morning, friendship students! I know we're all sad Professor Sparkle is away. But don't worry, because she left me in charge to do things just the way she would."
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,gallus,"Uh, I thought Starlight Glimmer was gonna be temporary headmare."
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,cozy glow,"She was, but she left me this note. [reading] ""I have to go. Twilight needs my help. I know the school is in good hooves with you, Cozy."" [giggles] Isn't that sweet? We won't let Starlight down, will we?"
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,smolder,"It's just kind of weird, isn't it?"
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,cozy glow,I don't know what you mean.
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,smolder,"Like, why'd she change her mind? Why did Starlight write a note instead of saying goodbye to us herself? Doesn't make any sense."
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,cozy glow,"[giggles] Oh, Smolder, you forget. We're not scheming dragons. We're ponies. Sounds like somecreature needs to do a little extra friendship homework."
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,yona,"Yak not pony either! If Smolder get homework, Yona get homework."
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,ocellus,"Me, too!"
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,sandbar,I'm in!
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,silverstream,Yeah! [laughs] Homework party!
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,gallus,[groans] Fine.
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,cozy glow,What loyalty. Professor Rainbow Dash would be so proud. You are such good friends. You all are. And I'm grateful because it will be awfully hard running a whole school alone. Can I count on each of you to help me?
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,cozy glow,"Thank you so much! It's just like our professors taught us. Together, we can get through anything!"
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,rarity,Ow! Ugh! I have had it with these horrible flies! [whines] I miss my magic!
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,twilight sparkle,Have you tried using your tail to shoo them away?
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,rarity,[gasps] Bite your tongue! It's for decorative purposes only!
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,pinkie pie,Hey! I didn't know we packed green cupcakes.
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,fluttershy,"Um, we didn't. They must've gone bad without magic to keep them cold."
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,rainbow dash,"""Magic"" this, ""magic"" that. We don't need magic to go on a little hike."
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,rarity,You were saying?
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,applejack,"You just need to think more like Earth ponies, y'all. Granny's ""Apple Core No-Bite-No-More""! That'll keep the flies off."
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,pinkie pie,[sniffs] Ugh! It smells just like it looks!
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,fluttershy,"Even if our food's spoiled, these blueberries are still good to eat."
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,spike,Too bad we can't do anything about the rainstorm.
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,rainbow dash,"I can't stop that storm by myself, but I can still help!"
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,twilight sparkle,I think we have all the magic we need right here. Not that I don't want to get it back. Heh. Let's go!
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,sandbar,"Uh, temporary headmare? Right, guys?"
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,silverstream,Finally! We thought you forgot about study club.
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,sandbar,Sorry I'm late. Cozy Glow gave our class tickets to a Sapphire Shores concert in Ponyville tonight.
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,gallus,You get the feeling Cozy's trying too hard to make us like her?
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,ocellus,Or maybe she just wants to help us keep our minds off of how scary it is that magic's disappearing.
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,smolder,I don't trust her. What's she up to behind those big eyes and bouncy curls?
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,yona,And why Cozy pony coming out of catacombs so late at night?
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,gallus,Let's go ask her.
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,twilight sparkle,"This is the only door to Tartarus. The good news is the seal isn't broken, so we know Tirek didn't escape."
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,applejack,"Let me guess. You got bad news, too?"
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,twilight sparkle,"Last time I was here, I had to use magic to get in. And according to Star Swirl, all unicorn magic was gone by yesterday's sunset."
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,rainbow dash,Maybe he was wrong.
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,pinkie pie,"Don't worry, Twilight. I got this."
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,pinkie pie,Free pizza delivery!
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,pinkie pie,"Huh. Always worked before. Oh, well."
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,applejack,Did any of y'all pack somethin' that could actually help?
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,rarity,"These all do magic, but not the kind we're looking for, I'm afraid."
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,spike,How about this?
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,twilight sparkle,"The Key of Unfettered Entrance! Where did you find this, Spike?"
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,spike,In your bag. Cozy Glow must've packed it for you.
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,twilight sparkle,She really did think of everything.
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,fluttershy,"Um, what does it do?"
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,twilight sparkle,It can magically open any door. And since artifacts like this haven't lost their power yet...
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,twilight sparkle,I guess it only works once.
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,applejack,Cockatrice!
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,rarity,"Do something, Fluttershy!"
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,rainbow dash,Don't look at it! It'll turn you to stone!
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,pinkie pie,I don't feel like stone.
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,pinkie pie,Unless it's really bouncy stone.
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,fluttershy,"I think he lost his magic, too. All the creatures here must have."
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,twilight sparkle,Star Swirl said that would happen on the second day.
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,spike,"I know it should make me feel safer, but it just makes me sad. We gotta fix this!"
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,chancellor neighsay,Where is Princess Twilight?!
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,cozy glow,"Oh, golly. She's away on a quest. I'm watching the school for her."
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,chancellor neighsay,"Magic is failing across our land, and she left a foal in charge of this facility?"
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,cozy glow,"Yes, sir! Is there anything I can do for you?"
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,chancellor neighsay,"That won't be necessary. Twilight's folly stops here. As of now, I am headstallion. And I have quite a few changes to make."
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,pinkie pie,"If all these monsters lost their magic, then getting past Cerberus should be easy-peasy!"
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,rainbow dash,Look out!
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,fluttershy,I'll talk to him.
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,fluttershy,"Um, excuse me, puppy?"
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,fluttershy,"You're a very good guard dog. Yes, you are. But, um, we were wondering if we could get by to check on Tirek."
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,applejack,That looks like a yes.
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,rarity,"I'll get you a towel, darling."
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,lord tirek,The Princess of Friendship here for a visit. What have I done to earn the honor of your company?
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,twilight sparkle,"We want answers, Tirek. Magic is disappearing from Equestria."
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,lord tirek,"I know. What a waste of such... [slurping] ...mmmm, delicious power."
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,rainbow dash,So you are behind this!
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,lord tirek,"Silly filly, if I had all of that magic, you think I'd still be locked up in here? But I might know something about it..."
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,cozy glow,What are you doing?! Those are Twilight's student files!
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,chancellor neighsay,"These aren't. Not anymore. With Equestria under attack, ponies must stand together. Twilight has endangered us all by skipping off on friendship trips while these dangerous creatures run loose."
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,cozy glow,"You don't think they're the reason magic is disappearing, do you?"
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,chancellor neighsay,"Yes, and I came to warn Twilight. But since she is gone, it falls to me to protect you foals from these monsters."
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,chancellor neighsay,Did you hear something?
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,cozy glow,It sounded like it came from over there!
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,chancellor neighsay,You again. As I suspected.
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,chancellor neighsay,"From now on, this school is pony-only! As nature intended."
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,chancellor neighsay,"Since you refuse to explain your plot against Equestria and return the magic you stole, you will stay here while I summon your guardians to take you home."
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,sandbar,"Wait! You were right about them from the beginning, Chancellor. I see that now."
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,smolder,What are you saying?!
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,silverstream,Sandbar?!
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,sandbar,I don't want anything to do with creatures that could threaten Equestria!
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,chancellor neighsay,"Wisely put, colt."
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,chancellor neighsay,Everypony will come to their senses eventually.
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,apple bloom,What in tarnation?!
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,sandbar,Sorry. I ran out of apples. I need the Cutie Mark Crusaders. My friends are in trouble. Chancellor Neighsay locked them up.
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,apple bloom,Huh? I thought Cozy Glow was in charge.
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,sandbar,"Not anymore. But you guys are good buddies. If you can convince her to distract Neighsay, I can break out my friends. Will you help me?"
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,apple bloom,Do mulberries have seeds?
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,apple bloom,That's a yes.
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,twilight sparkle,"Where is Equestria's magic going, Tirek? What's making it disappear?"
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,lord tirek,"If you let me out, I'm sure it will jog my memory. What do you say? I scratch your back, you scratch mine?"
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,rainbow dash,"How about you tell us what you know or you'll be stuck here forever, because we're out of magic keys and nopony can open the door?"
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,rarity,"Oh, dear. I hadn't thought of that."
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,spike,We're just as trapped as Tirek?
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,lord tirek,"[chuckles] What a pity. Well, for you. Sweet revenge for me. It seems my little prot<e9>g<e9>'s plan worked after all."
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,applejack,Which little prot<e9>g<e9>?
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,lord tirek,"Oh, we've never met. We're pen pals. Each letter had so many questions about draining magic."
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,pinkie pie,And you answered them?!
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,lord tirek,I was bored. So I simply pointed my pen pal in the right direction.
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,fluttershy,"Can't you just tell us your pen pal's name? I mean, since we're stuck here anyway?"
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,lord tirek,"Oh, why not? The irony is too perfect. Her name is..."
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,sandbar,Cozy Glow! I-I could've sworn I saw her come down this way when she left her office.
School Raze - Part 1,Nicole Dubuc,cozy glow,"Enjoying yourself in there, Starlight? I'm sorry I had to push you in. But what else could I do? You were going to ruin all my plans."
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,princess celestia,Magic is disappearing all across Equestria!
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,cozy glow,Didn't we learn about a creature that eats magic?
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,princess luna,Somepony should investigate.
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,We'll go.
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,gallus,I thought Starlight Glimmer was gonna be temporary headmare.
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,chancellor neighsay,"With Equestria under attack, ponies must stand together."
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,sandbar,I need the Cutie Mark Crusaders. My friends are in trouble.
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,lord tirek,It seems my little prot<e9>g<e9>'s plan worked after all.
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,Cozy Glow is behind all of this?!
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,spike,"Um, there's seven of us."
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,I knew we shouldn't have left!
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,applejack,"But Starlight's in charge at the school. If anypony can stop Cozy Glow, it's her."
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,We have to get out of here. Her students can't handle Cozy on their own.
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,rarity,Not everything can be solved with brute force. We need magic to escape.
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,pinkie pie,"Maybe there's a way to get out without magic. Like a secret lever or a secret button or a secret admirer who knows a secret about you but is all, ""Your secret's safe with me because I put it in Tartarus and I have a key!"""
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"I'm afraid not. The most powerful villains and monsters of all time are trapped here. And without our magic, so are we."
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"Unless... These creatures might be losing their magical powers, but there's still a magic that makes up what they are. Maybe we can borrow some of that."
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,cozy glow,"Uh, excuse me? Um, Chancellor Neighsay?"
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,chancellor neighsay,You might as well get used to calling me Headstallion Neighsay. I plan to be here for quite some time.
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,cozy glow,"Gee, it sure is a relief to have somepony in charge, what with the magical crisis going on. And we're all so grateful to you for taking care of those... non-ponies. But doesn't the EEA need you?"
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,chancellor neighsay,What the EEA needs is somepony to protect this school from the threats at Equestria's borders instead of gallivanting off on adventures beyond them.
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,cozy glow,Twilight didn't just run off willy-nilly. She left me in charge. I'm her right-hoof mare!
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,chancellor neighsay,"Another in a long list of mistakes the Princess of Friendship has made. Rest assured, from now on, this school shall be run according to strict EEA guidelines."
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,chancellor neighsay,The way it always should've been.
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,cozy glow,"Well, that sounds just peachy<U+0097>"
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,cozy glow,...Headstallion Neighsay.
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,sweetie belle,Cozy Glow did all of this? How? Why?
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,apple bloom,"I don't know. But come on, y'all. We gotta get Starlight out of there before she comes back."
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,sandbar,Wait!
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,scootaloo,Sweetie Belle!
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,sweetie belle,Help!
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,apple bloom,That's gotta be what's suckin' up all the magic in Equestria.
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,sandbar,"But if that's true, then Twilight and the others went to Tartarus for nothing. And if all of Equestria's magic's getting sucked up in there, there's no way for them to get back!"
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,scootaloo,We need to get help!
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,sweetie belle,"But Starlight's trapped here, and there's no way to get word to Celestia or anypony else!"
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,apple bloom,I guess we're on our own.
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,smolder,"Still locked, huh?"
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,gallus,We gotta at least try to get out.
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,ocellus,"Why? If Sandbar's turned his back on us, every other pony probably has, too."
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,yona,Sandbar not turn his back! Sandbar is our friend!
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,smolder,"Uh, did you miss the part where he said he didn't want anything to do with us?"
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,silverstream,Maybe he just said that so one of us could be free to snoop around and figure out what's going on.
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,sandbar,I dunno. That sounds too clever for a pony to come up with.
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,yona,"[gasps, laughs] Yona knew Sandbar was still our friend!"
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,sweetie belle,We all are.
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,scootaloo,Except for Cozy Glow. That pony is not who we thought she was.
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,apple bloom,She's the one draining magic out of Equestria!
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,sandbar,"We'll explain on the way. But right now, we gotta get to get to Chancellor Neighsay."
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,gallus,Huh?
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,sandbar,"I know he doesn't like non-ponies. But if we tell him what's going on, he'll help."
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,chancellor neighsay,"I am sure you are all concerned about the magic situation. But I want to assure you that this institution is safe, despite the absence of your headmare. As your new headstallion, let me be the first to say that the reign of Princess Twilight is over! From now on, this school will adhere to EEA doctrine, as it should have from the start!"
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,cozy glow,"[claps] Thank you, Chancellor Neighsay, for that rousing speech. I know you're a stallion who truly believes what you say. And when you say this school will be run according to EEA doctrine, I know you mean it. And when you say there won't be any more lessons from the Princess of Friendship at the School of Friendship, I guess you mean that, too."
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,chancellor neighsay,That's not exactly what<U+0097>
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,cozy glow,"But Twilight decided to run her school outside of the EEA guidelines. And even though you tried to stop her, Princesses Celestia and Luna trusted her enough to support her."
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,chancellor neighsay,"Well, I-I wouldn't say that<U+0097>"
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,cozy glow,"So, since I know you mean what you say, my question is really for the students. Are we going to give the pony who already tried to wreck Twilight's school once another chance to do it?"
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,cozy glow,I guess things will have to stay the way Twilight wants them. Which includes leaving me in charge.
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,chancellor neighsay,This<U+0097>! I can<U+0097>! Just<U+0097>!
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,sandbar,Okay. So maybe we need a new plan.
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,cozy glow,"Oh, oh, not too tight. We don't want to hurt the Chancellor."
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,cozy glow,"I'm sure Twilight will know what to do with him when she gets back. Now, back to class, everyone. We let the EEA disrupt our friendship studies long enough."
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,chancellor neighsay,[grunting] Why are you doing this? I thought you wanted to have somepony in charge of the school.
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,cozy glow,"Oh, I do. You just aren't the pony I had in mind."
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,scootaloo,"Hey, Cozy Glow! What's so funny?"
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,sweetie belle,Are you just happy to be running the school?
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,cozy glow,"Oh, I'm just keeping Twilight's seat warm."
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,apple bloom,"Still, it's pretty impressive."
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,sweetie belle,Is there anything we can do to help?
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,scootaloo,We can hang out with you all day if you want.
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,cozy glow,"You know, there is something I need help with."
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,chancellor neighsay,"Oh, wonderful. I suppose you've all come to gloat?"
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,silverstream,"Actually, we've come to undo all these chains and free you!"
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,chancellor neighsay,But... But why?
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,yona,"Now that nasty pony met even nastier pony, maybe nasty pony not be so nasty."
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,sandbar,"Also, we'd kind of like to stop Cozy before she drains all the magic from Equestria."
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,chancellor neighsay,She's behind that as well? I must get word to Celestia and Luna.
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,sandbar,"How? Without magic, it'll take forever to get to them."
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,chancellor neighsay,"While it's true that unicorns have lost their ability to cast spells, the most potent magic in Equestria is housed in our... artifacts. The EEA medallion allows me to travel throughout Equestria. Its magic worked when I chained you up. Perhaps it still has enough to send me to the princesses."
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,ocellus,I hope he makes it.
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,smolder,I hope he doesn't come back and lock us up again.
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,gallus,If he comes back.
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,silverstream,Everything's gonna be fine! Twilight and the others are probably already on their way!
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,fluttershy,"Um, are you sure there's magic in Cerberus? Clarissa the pig has two tails, and while her singing voice is lovely, I don't think it's magical."
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,We need to try everything if we want to get out of here.
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,pinkie pie,I don't know. Tartarus isn't so bad. I could hang out here for a while!
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,pinkie pie,Eh. Maybe not forever though.
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,lord tirek,"But that is just what it will be! If my prot<e9>g<e9> has followed my instructions, by sunset tonight, every last vestige of Equestrian magic will disappear into the ether forever!"
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,Have you even thought about what losing magic would mean?
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,lord tirek,It means the six of you will be trapped here! Like me!
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,spike,Seven!
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,Exactly. It means you're trapped here. Forever. With us.
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,lord tirek,Uhhhh... I hadn't thought of it like that.
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,spike,"So, what do we do, Twilight?"
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"Dash and Applejack nearly have Cerberus tired out. If Rarity pitches in, I think they can get him to sit still long enough to try what I have in mind."
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,fluttershy,"I'm sure I can get the other monsters to help. [whispering, to Spike] Besides, I would never call them monsters."
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,spike,"What about Tirek? He's probably got some magic, too, right?"
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,pinkie pie,Leave him to me.
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,rarity,[to Cerberus] Down!
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,fluttershy,"Okay, everyone! Time to show Equestria that you aren't monsters! You're wonderful, mystical creatures!"
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,pinkie pie,"I know it's not your birthday, so You get a party, even though We'll sing and dance from one to ten And then we'll do it all again!"
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,lord tirek,Fine! I'll help you leave! Just please stop!
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,pinkie pie,Tirek's in!
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,apple bloom,It's just so excitin' to have a foal our age runnin' things. We should have an ice cream social every day!
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,cozy glow,"That's a splendid idea, Apple Bloom. But to tell you the truth, the thing I need help with most is cleaning."
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,sweetie belle,Say no more. Just take us around the school and show us everything you want cleaned.
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,cozy glow,"Well, actually, you could start right in here."
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,scootaloo,It looks pretty clean already.
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,cozy glow,Do you three think you can fool me?! I know a diversion when I see it!
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,yona,"Uh, why pony lead us back down here?"
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,sandbar,"We obviously can't handle Cozy on our own. But we can't just sit around and wait for help. So, there's one more prisoner I think we should free."
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,silverstream,Ooh! I guess Starlight! Is it Starlight?
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,yona,"Counselor pony, come out! We need help with nasty pony!"
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,sandbar,She can't talk to us from in there. We'll have to figure a way to get her out.
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,gallus,"Hey! This is just like chapter twelve in ""Kanthaka's Facts and Artifacts"" from Twilight's class!"
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,gallus,"What? I've been studying. Finals are coming up, you know?"
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,ocellus,"Actually, I remember that, too! Cozy must've linked these artifacts to act like a mystical magnet, attracting all the magic in Equestria into that orb."
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,smolder,"So, we can shut it down by yanking one of these things out, right?"
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,ocellus,"Sure, though that would probably cause a magical feedback loop and destroy the whole school!"
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,cozy glow,"Destroy the School of Friendship?! Oh, dear! Chancellor Neighsay was wrong about a lot of things, but I guess he was right about all of you!"
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,All right. Is everypony ready?
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,rarity,[to Cerberus] Sit! Good! [to Twilight Sparkle] I can't say for how much longer.
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,pinkie pie,All eternity!
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,lord tirek,"Yes, by all means, please! Just get on with it!"
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,pinkie pie,"There's your cue, you evil centaur, you."
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,That's it! I think it's working!
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,Come on! I don't know how long I can hold it!
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,rainbow dash,[to Cerberus] Good boy!
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,fluttershy,"[to creatures] Bye, friends. Hopefully, we'll be able to turn you all back into your normal, wonderful selves soon."
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,pinkie pie,"[to Lord Tirek] Thanks for the assist, your redness!"
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,pinkie pie,Yay! Twilight did it!
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,I couldn't have done it without all your help.
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,rarity,I'm not sure we did!
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,No!
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,applejack,Tirek said all of Equestria's magic would be gone at sunset.
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"Without magic, there's no way we'll get back to the school in time!"
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,fluttershy,What does that mean?
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,It means... we've failed!
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,cozy glow,"After everything Twilight's done for you, why would you want to destroy her school?"
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,gallus,We don't! You're the one using these artifacts to drain magic from Equestria!
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,cozy glow,Me?! We all just saw you with your claws all over them! [gasps] It all makes sense. These creatures want magic gone from Equestria because it's the only thing ponies have that they don't!
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,ocellus,"Technically, there's a magical component when Silverstream and I transform."
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,yona,And Yona's friends' friendship is magic! Twilight said!
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,cozy glow,And you repay her by sending her to Tartarus on a wild goose chase so you could destroy everything she built! [gasps] They've even trapped Starlight in that-that thing! We have to defend this school!
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,sandbar,"No! No, don't listen to her!"
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,smolder,Gallus!
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,cozy glow,They brought this on themselves. There's nothing we can do.
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,cozy glow,"Yeah, yeah. The Elements of Harmony are very important. They're just not applicable in every circumstance. And with magic gone from Equestria, I'm not even sure the Tree of Harmony will be as helpful as it once was."
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,cozy glow,What's happening?!
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,gallus,Guess our friendship is pretty magical after all.
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,ocellus,Hurry! Grab the artifacts!
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,silverstream,"Um, didn't you say that could destroy the school?"
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,ocellus,"But if we don't try, we could lose magic forever!"
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,sandbar,You all better get clear!
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,cozy glow,Wait! Where are you going?! Stoooooop!
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,yona,[laughs] Counselor pony<U+0097>!
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,starlight glimmer,"Uh, it's nice to see you, too."
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,ocellus,I guess magic is back.
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,cozy glow,You've ruined everything! Now Twilight and her ridiculous friends can escape from Tartarus!
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,cozy glow,I mean... Yay! All my friends are safe!
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,applejack,"You can drop the act, Cozy Glow! Your pen pal Tirek told us all about how he helped you suck up all that magic!"
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,But I still don't understand why.
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,cozy glow,"[growls] Why?! Because friendship is power! You might be the Princess of Friendship, but as headmare of this school, I can collect even more friends than you!"
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"You're the one who doesn't get it, Cozy. Friendship is powerful, but power isn't why you make friends. I'm sorry I couldn't teach you that."
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,gallus,"Well, you taught us."
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,silverstream,You can't let one bad apple make you think you failed.
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,sandbar,And we never could've stopped her if we hadn't learned what you taught us about friendship.
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,cozy glow,"Honesty? Loyalty? Generosity? Blah-blah-blah! I can make more friends without using any of them! And if I can't do it here, I'll do it somewhere else!"
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,chancellor neighsay,"[sighs] I'm glad you're back in charge of the School of Friendship, Princess."
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,chancellor neighsay,It's clear to me now that there is nopony better suited for the job.
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,What's going on?
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,silverstream,"Hi, Headmare Twilight! We're just practicing for graduation!"
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,Graduation?
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,gallus,"Now that we've saved Equestria, we figure we're done with school."
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"Saving Equestria is nice, but I'm afraid it'll take more than one semester to learn all there is to know about friendship."
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,spike,[belches] Told ya.
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,chancellor neighsay,Your headmare is right. I thought friendship was something only ponies should share with each other. But you all taught me how wrong I was. I suppose true friendship can take a lifetime to understand.
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,"If it were easy to learn, we wouldn't need a school."
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,apple bloom,[yelps] We held her off as long as we could!
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,scootaloo,But she locked us in this closet!
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,sweetie belle,What happened?! Is everything all right?! Where's Cozy Glow?!
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,twilight sparkle,Everything worked out just fine.
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,princess celestia,"As for Cozy Glow, I can assure you <U+0097> where she's going, she won't be causing any more trouble."
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,lord tirek,Of course it's boring here now! But at least you're not in a cage!
School Raze - Part 2,Josh Haber,cozy glow,"Hey, neighbor. Wanna be friends?"

My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,twilight sparkle,"I got way behind grading midterms, and Cadance and Shining Armor are coming here with Flurry Heart for Hearth's Warming Eve, and I haven't started decorating, and I don't know what to get any of you, and<U+0097>!"
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,applejack,Stop! Take a breath.
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,applejack,Now let it out sloooooooooowwww...
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,applejack,"Now, I think I have an idea that might help. What if we change up how we give gifts this year and do a Hearthswarmin' Helper?"
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,fluttershy,What's a Hearthswarming Helper?
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,applejack,"Whenever the whole Apple family got together, there were just so many of us, it didn't make sense to buy everypony gifts. So we'd put our names in a hat..."
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,pinkie pie,"Ooh, a game of chance! Tell me more."
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,applejack,"...then we'd pull a name, but keep it a secret."
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,pinkie pie,A dash of mystery. Good. Good.
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,applejack,"Instead of buyin' everypony a present, you just get one for the pony you picked from the hat."
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,pinkie pie,"Wait. So instead of lots of presents, I only buy one of you a present? What kind of game is this?!"
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,rarity,"Well, it would save time."
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,rainbow dash,"[clears throat] The less shopping, the better. In!"
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,fluttershy,"Will that help, Twilight?"
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,twilight sparkle,I was stressed about shopping.
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,pinkie pie,[sighs] Fine. I will only buy one present for my secret Hearthswarming Helper buddy.
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,applejack,We just need to put everypony's name in this here hat.
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,applejack,Y'all ready? No peekin'.
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,pinkie pie,So excited! Aah! Too excited! I don't wanna give anything away!
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,pinkie pie,Wheeee!
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,rarity,When will the gift exchange occur?
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,rainbow dash,"How about Twilight's castle tomorrow night, Hearth's Warming Eve?"
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,applejack,That's perfect! Pinkie and I can spend the evenin' with y'all and the next mornin' with our families!
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,twilight sparkle,"And thanks to all of you, I should be ready to celebrate by then!"
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,fluttershy,"Oh, this is so exciting!"
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,spike,"Uh... Um, Applejack, is it against the rules to trade names? Like if I had a better idea for somepony special? I mean specific?"
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,applejack,"If you can figure out who has the pony you want and they're okay with tradin', I guess it's fine."
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,spike,"Great! So, uh, who do you<U+0097>?"
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,applejack,I don't have Rarity.
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,spike,What?! That's not who I<U+0097>!
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,applejack,Uh-huh.
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,spike,"Heeeey, Twilight! Whatcha planning to get your secret pony?"
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,twilight sparkle,Not sure. I'm getting the castle ready for my family first. Then I'll shop.
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,spike,Maybe something sparkly? Fashionable?
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,twilight sparkle,No! Those aren't really the kind of things my pony likes.
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,spike,"Oh. Welp, gotta go! Wish me luck!"
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,twilight sparkle,With shopping?
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,spike,"Well, yeah! If everypony's only getting one gift, we have a ton of responsibility to make sure it's extra-special good."
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,twilight sparkle,"I didn't think of it that way. The present I get for Pinkie Pie should make or break her holiday. I can't just go shopping and hope to find something nice. This needs forethought, planning, research! I'll decoarate later. Knowing Pinkie, she probably already has a perfect idea what to get her pony."
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,pinkie pie,I have no idea what to get my pony!
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,pinkie pie,Those were for when I was getting all of my friends matching harmony Hearth's Warming hats! Now it's just Twilight! [sobs] I can't give one pony a matching present with nothing to match it! I need something special for only her!
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,maud pie,[deadpan] I've got it.
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,pinkie pie,"I don't think Twilight likes rocks as much as you do, Maud."
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,maud pie,[deadpan] Don't rock it 'til you try it.
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,pinkie pie,"Thanks for the vote of confidence, Gummy. But this is the biggest holiday challenge I've ever faced!"
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,pinkie pie,"[to Limestone] Uh, this one's for you. Hey! This is the biggest holiday challenge I've ever faced! How exciting is that?! Am I up for the challenge? I know I'm good at gift-giving, but am I the best at gift-giving?"
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,spike,Pinkie!
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,pinkie pie,I don't have Rarity!
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,spike,Whoa!
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,rarity,"Oh! [chuckles] How's your shopping going, Spike?"
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,spike,"Uh, fine!"
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,rarity,[whispering] Which pony did you get?
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,spike,I can't... remember?
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,rarity,"I've got Applejack, darling. She's going to adore her present. There's a brilliant designer in Manehattan <U+0096> Fedora Felt <U+0096> who makes the most marvelous hats. I asked for a new take on western chic that would be the envy of every farm pony in Equestria."
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,spike,"That's a great gift, Rarity. I hope I can find something for my pony as special as you are. Uh, she is! U-Uh, bye!"
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,rainbow dash,"Okay, what about your favorite food?"
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,fluttershy,Ooh. I couldn't pick just one. What if it hurt the other foods' feelings?
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,rainbow dash,"Riiiiight... But there's gotta be something you really, really like."
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,fluttershy,"I really, really like... everything! Why do you ask?"
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,rainbow dash,"Juuuust getting gift ideas. Uh, for my pony. Who isn't you. So, uh, is there anything you don't like?"
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,fluttershy,Hmmm... Not liking things!
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,fluttershy,I hope that helped!
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,spike,"Hey, Fluttershy! Thinking of getting that for your Hearthswarming Helper?"
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,fluttershy,Mm-hmm. She loves shiny things.
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,spike,[overacted] I wish I knew what my secret pony wanted. She's so hard to shop for.
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,fluttershy,"Oh, no. Maybe I could help. Unless you don't want to<U+0097>"
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,spike,Rainbow Dash.
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,fluttershy,Oh! I was just talking to Rainbow Dash about these<U+0097>
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,spike,Great idea! We should trade ponies!
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,fluttershy,Wait. Trade?
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,spike,"Well, Applejack said it's not against the rules. And you know what Rainbow Dash likes, so it's perfect. [gasps] Rarity?! What a surprise! [chuckles] Thanks!"
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,applejack,There you are! I need your help.
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,fluttershy,"Do you want to trade names, too?"
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,applejack,What? No. I just need help figurin' out what to get Spike.
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,fluttershy,Phew!
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,rainbow dash,Candle. Great. Whatever. Fluttershy-shopping done.
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,discord,Ugh. You can't honestly be serious.
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,rainbow dash,Ghost candle!
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,discord,A candle is what you buy when you have no idea what to get somepony.
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,rainbow dash,"[groans] What do you want, Discord?"
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,discord,"Fluttershy told me about this Hearth's whatever-it's-called. I may not be invited, but I wanted to make sure she gets a quality gift."
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,rainbow dash,"I tried asking her what she likes, but she likes everything."
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,discord,"Well, she says that, but her real friends know what she actually likes."
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,rainbow dash,I've known her a lot longer than you have.
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,discord,"Then you must surely know that lit candles around adorably flammable animals make her nervous, don't you?"
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,rainbow dash,[groans] Fine. I'll get her something else.
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,discord,Perhaps I'll tag along to steer you in the right direction.
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,rainbow dash,Whoa!
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,fluttershy,I come to the Rainbow Falls Hearth's Warming Craft Fair every year. They have perfect presents for anypony.
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,applejack,"Hopefully, anydragon, too. Wanna split up? Meet back here in an hour?"
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,fluttershy,Sure.
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,flam,"Oh, no! There's only a few left!"
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,flim,"Fillies and gentlecolts, we want you all to have the best holiday your bits can buy! But there are only a limited number left!"
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,fluttershy,[to Flam] Limited number of what?
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,flam,"Why, you don't know about Holly the Hearth Warmer?"
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,flim,You seem like somepony looking for a gift for a very special friend.
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,fluttershy,I am!
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,flim,A friend who wouldn't want to miss out on the must-have gift everypony is talking about?
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,fluttershy,She certainly wouldn't wanna miss out on that.
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,flim,A truly awesome friend who deserves something twenty percent cooler than any other gift out there?
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,fluttershy,That sounds just like her!
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,flim,"Well, look no further! This is it!"
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,fluttershy,Ooh! Ooh! How much does it cost?!
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,flim,How much do you have?
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,prince rutherford,Yojan! Is that good angle for optimal smashing?!
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,pinkie pie,Guess who!
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,prince rutherford,Yojan?
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,pinkie pie,"No, silly!"
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,prince rutherford,"Ingville? Tormand? No, no, wait! Grimhorn!"
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,pinkie pie,"Nope-ity, nope, nein, and nyet! It's me!"
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,prince rutherford,"Aww, Prince Rutherford knew it Pink Pony all along! Yaks best at guessing."
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,prince rutherford,[exclaims] Not here! Follow this way!
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,prince rutherford,[whispering] Prince Rutherford about to tell honorary yak friend something very top secret.
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,pinkie pie,Honorary yak friend listening.
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,prince rutherford,[whispering] Yaks best at all things except one. Yaks not best at giving gifts.
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,pinkie pie,[gasps] What?!
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,prince rutherford,[whispering] I know! It hard to believe!
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,pinkie pie,How am I gonna figure out how to give Twilight the best Hearth's Warming gift ever?!
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,prince rutherford,"[whispering] Oh, no worry, honorary yak. Prince Rutherford keep secret map in perfectly organized files."
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,prince rutherford,"Best gift givers up northern pass, where sky shimmers and glows. There, secret gift giver grove. Only yak princes and pink honorary yak know."
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,pinkie pie,[muffled] My lips are sealed.
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,pinkie pie,[shouting] Time for my top-secret quest to the Gift Givers!
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,derpy,"Oh, hi, Rarity. How can I help you?"
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,rarity,"I expected a package today, and I was wondering where that might be."
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,derpy,"Oh, okay. Uh, let's check. Name?"
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,rarity,"Uh, Rarity?"
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,derpy,"[clears throat, mumbles] Oh! Here we go! Your package was delivered to Sweet Apple Acres."
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,rarity,What?! It was supposed to be delivered to Rarity's Boutique!
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,derpy,"Um... okay... but... now, the package was for Applejack, and she is at Sweet Apple Acres."
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,rarity,"[low growl] Yes, it's for Applejack, but I will be delivering it."
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,derpy,Uh... that's my job.
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,rarity,It's a gift for Applejack from me.
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,derpy,"[gasps] What if she opens it?! It shouldn't go to Sweet Apple Acres! Oh! Wait! It went to Sweet Acorn Orchard instead! [laughs] Oh, well, that's a relief."
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,rarity,Why is that a relief?!
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,derpy,Because Applejack's not in Sweet Acorn Orchard. Do you want me to get the package and deliver it to her?
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,rarity,"No! [clears throat] Uh, may I have the address for Sweet Acorn Orchard? I think I'll just collect the package myself."
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,derpy,Are you sure? 'Cause I would be happy to<U+0097>
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,rarity,You have helped so much already.
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,derpy,Break time!
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,spike,Shopping for Rarity. No problem. She likes lots of stuff. I just need something special.
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,spike,[gasps] Oooh... Wow! Awesome! Shopping for Rarity. Slight problem. She likes lots of stuff. But nothing is special enough!
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,discord,"Oh, goodness, no."
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,rainbow dash,Ugh!
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,discord,Even worse!
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,rainbow dash,"Oh, come on!  Fluttershy would love a spa day!"
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,discord,"Really? Love the stress of deciding which treatment to get? Love worrying that she's not relaxing enough? Or relaxing too much? And what about all those sweet animals she's left alone?! So much to worry about, and all because of you."
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,rainbow dash,She's Fluttershy! Everything makes her worry!
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,discord,Now you sound like somepony who knows her!
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,rainbow dash,"Well, if you're such an expert on Fluttershy, what did you get her?"
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,discord,"Oh, and you honestly expect me to tell you what I got Fluttershy so that you can one-up me? Well, I have half a mind to stop you entirely."
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,rainbow dash,Good! Please stop helping me! I'm begging you!
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,discord,"Well, I suppose I could tell you what my backup present was."
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,rainbow dash,[sarcastically] Great. Still helping.
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,discord,It would've made a lovely addition to her animal sanctuary. But you have to be the fastest pony in Equestria to even have a chance of<U+0097>
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,rainbow dash,"Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa. You're talking to the fastest pony in Equestria! If there's some fast animal out there Fluttershy would love, I'm the one who can get it."
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,discord,"Oh, I just don't know."
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,rainbow dash,I'm calling it! Dibs!
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,twilight sparkle,"The ideal gift for Pinkie Pie needs to be A <U+0096> unique, B <U+0096> specific to her personality, and C <U+0096> food-based. What is a unique food? Cupcakes? Nah. Cookies? Nope. Pies? Pastries? Pudding? [gasps] Wait! [echoing] Puuuuuuuuuuuudding!

My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,twilight sparkle,Where's the recipe?!
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,applejack,"I've narrowed down my choices for Spike to fire-dancing sticks, or a Power Ponies comic. Unenchanted, I think. Aah! What is that?!"
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,fluttershy,Holly the Hearth's Warmer doll. Isn't she sweet?
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,applejack,Egh. Why'd you think that was a good gift for Rainbow Dash?
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,fluttershy,It's the must-have gift of the season. And in short supply.
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,applejack,"""Short supply"", huh? How much did that set you back?"
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,fluttershy,All my bits. All my bits? Can I borrow some for the train ride home?
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,applejack,Somethin' about this here doll seems fishy. And I ain't just talkin' about the smell of that plastic. Where'd you get it?
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,applejack,Flim and Flam! What are those two Hearth's Warmin' hooligans up to now?!
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,rarity,"Uh, is this Sweet Acorn Orchard?"
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,rarity,"Rarity. Uh, pleasure. I'm actually here about a package that was recently deliv<U+0097>"
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,rarity,"[sighs] So it did arrive! [chuckles] Uh, if I could just<U+0097>"
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,rarity,Thank me?
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,rarity,As an... acorn farmer?
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,rarity,Mm-hmm.
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,rarity,"Oh, well, I, uh... I would be delighted."
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,twilight sparkle,"The recipe for Chancellor Puddinghead's magical pudding was filed under ""Magical Spells"", not ""Recipes"".

My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,princess cadance,"Uh, the scroll we sent yesterday?"
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,twilight sparkle,"Yesterday. Right. Welcome! Uh, what are you doing?"
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,shining armor,"Decorations not up. Frazzled mane. Determined look. I've seen this before. What are you obsessing about this time, Twily?"
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,twilight sparkle,Nothing!
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,shining armor,"So, decorations aren't up because...?"
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,twilight sparkle,"Uh, I thought it would be more fun if we all decorated it together!"
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,princess cadance,"Oh, that sounds wonderful. We could start decorating right aw<U+0097>"
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,twilight sparkle,After I finish one quick errand. Just a few ingredients. Nothing to obsess about here! [laughs] Make yourselves at home. Be right back! Promise!

My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,pinkie pie,Ooh! I like that box!
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,pinkie pie,[gasps] The perfect gift! Wow! I don't get it.
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,flim,We said no refunds!
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,flim,Oh. You.
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,applejack,What are y'all doin' with these dolls and that ridiculous getup? Don't you have a resort to run?
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,flim,"It's off-season. Besides, we're planning an expansion."
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,flam,And expansions cost bits.
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,fluttershy,"Well, that sounds fu<U+0097>"
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,applejack,It ain't no excuse for sellin' cheap dolls to ponies.
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,flim,We're just giving ponies what they want.
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,flam,Shopping for the perfect gift is stressful.
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,fluttershy,"Oh, that's true."
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,flim,You want to get something that really stands out.
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,fluttershy,I do.
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,flam,"And when you tell your friend you got them the hottest gift in Rainbow Falls, what'll they say?"
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,fluttershy,"""Woo-hoo""?"
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,fluttershy,"Oh, right. They really are good at selling things."
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,flim,You may not like it.
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,flam,"But technically, we're not doing anything wrong."
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,flim,Ponies are desperate for the right gift.
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,flam,And who are you to tell them this isn't it?
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,flim,If ponies get tired of Holly after a few days...
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,flam,"...or she falls apart, who really got hurt?"
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,flim,Don't let the curtain hit ya on the way out.
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,fluttershy,"Of course Rainbow Dash wouldn't want this! I'm so mad, I could just... kick!"
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,applejack,Convincin' ponies to buy that doll ain't in the holiday spirit!
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,fluttershy,But Flim and Flam have a point. We can't tell ponies what to buy.
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,applejack,Huh. But maybe we can show 'em!
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,rainbow dash,Guh. Could you try to make less noise?
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,discord,We'll move silently.
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,discord,Blend into the shadows. The winterchilla will never hear us coming.
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,rainbow dash,Winterchilla?

My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,flim,"Have a wonderful holiday. And remember, no refunds. Next!"
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,flam,What are you doing here?
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,applejack,Same as everypony else.
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,applejack,"I want a Hearth's Warmer. In fact, I want three!"
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,flim,Seriously?
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,applejack,"[overacted] After I saw my friend here with hers, I knew I had to buy some for my granny, my brother, and my little sister!"
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,flim,"Yeah, yeah, great story. Next!"
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,fluttershy,"[overacted] But, Applejack, your granny, your brother, and your sister, they are all so different. How can the same doll be the right gift for all of them?"
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,applejack,"[overacted] But, Fluttershy, this is the must-have gift of the season."
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,fluttershy,"[overacted] Just because it's must-have for one pony doesn't mean it's must-have for everypony, does it?"
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,applejack,[overacted] That's true! I guess I need to put more thought into getting the right gift for each pony. Can I return these?
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,applejack,"Oh, uh, you want 'em? I'm gonna go pick out gifts that are just as special as the ponies they're for."
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,flim,"Now, hang on a moment! Wait! Come back!"
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,flam,We'll give you a great deal!
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,applejack,[sighs] The sweet sounds of the season.
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,rarity,"Oh, you've been so generous. But I must get home for a previous engagement. I'll be keeping an eye on you, Pistachio. I have the feeling you've got quite the future in fashion."
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,rarity,The hat is indeed for somepony very special. And I couldn't bear to see him part with it.
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,rarity,"But if I hear you call yourself a nopony again, you shan't be my guest for Fashion Week in Manehattan."
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,rarity,"[softly] Sorry, Applejack."
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,applejack,Puttin' those two in their places makes me all warm and fuzzy inside.
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,fluttershy,"Ooh. But we never got gifts for Spike or Rainbow Dash, and it's already Hearth's Warming Eve."
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,applejack,"It probably ain't what they're expectin', but we still got these. Yay."
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,fluttershy,Don't do that.
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,princess cadance,Flurry loved sledding.
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,shining armor,Too bad her aunt wasn't there.
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,twilight sparkle,Shh!
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,twilight sparkle,"There. Ingredients measured exactly. Now, what were you saying?"
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,shining armor,"Hi, remember us? We came all the way from the Crystal Empire for some quality family time?"
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,twilight sparkle,"Okay, I did get a little stressed about Hearth's Warming this year."
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,shining armor,[laughs] What? You? Never!
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,twilight sparkle,So my friends decided we should do a Hearthswarming Helper and give one pony a present to save time.
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,twilight sparkle,What?
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,shining armor,"Let me guess. You got super worried about making sure the present was perfect and went all Twily-nanas, didn't you?"
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,twilight sparkle,"I wasn't Twily-nanas! Okay, fine. A little Twily-nanas."
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,princess cadance,"Twilight, we know you get overwhelmed. You should have just told us. We could've helped."
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,twilight sparkle,"The good news is Pinkie's present is almost done, and it's just friends and family and a calm, quiet Hearth's Warming Eve."
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,discord,"[tearfully] Goodbye. Enjoy your exclusive pony-only holiday gathering. I'll just be home, spending quality time with... myself."
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,rainbow dash,"Uh... I wouldn't have this little fella without you, so... if you wanna join, Fluttershy would love having you. And I wouldn't totally hate it."
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,discord,"Great! Awesome! In that case<U+0097> Oh, look! Sunset! It's officially Hearth's Warming Eve!"
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,rainbow dash,What is it doing?
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,discord,"Oh. Uh, did I forget to mention that the winterchilla transforms into a winterzilla when the sun sets?"
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,fluttershy,How did everypony's shopping go?
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,rarity,Well...
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,pinkie pie,Uh...
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,applejack,Yeeeeeah...

My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,twilight sparkle,Magic pudding! What is that?!
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,rainbow dash,A winterchilla!
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,twilight sparkle,They turn into winterzillas after dark!
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,rainbow dash,Does everypony know this except me?!
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,spike,Aah!
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,twilight sparkle,[gasps] You like the sparkly?
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,twilight sparkle,Just follow it this way!
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,spike,Is this honestly the best plan we can come up with?!
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,rainbow dash,Can't you do something?!
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,discord,I did! This is Fluttershy's gift.
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,rainbow dash,What?!
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,rarity,"[grunting] A little help, please!"
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,shining armor,I've got this!
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,princess cadance,"Which one of us can fly, darling?"
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,rarity,Whoa!
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,shining armor,Your mom sure is something.
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,princess cadance,[giggles] You're not so bad yourself.
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,twilight sparkle,No-no-no! Not that sparkly! This one!
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,spike,[grunts] I'm okay if he doesn't want to chase me anymore!
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,applejack,How are we gonna get rid of this thing?!
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,discord,"Oh, for Scorpan's sake!"
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,discord,Hello?! If only one of you had a way with animals?!
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,fluttershy,"Oh, my."
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,fluttershy,Uh... [clears throat] Excuse me.
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,fluttershy,"Whoa! This is supposed to be the happiest time of year! So if this is how you plan on behaving, you can march yourself right back to where you came from!"
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,fluttershy,"Awww. Your family is gone for the holidays, and you're all alone?"
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,fluttershy,"I'm so sorry. If you calm down, I'm sure you could join us."
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,pinkie pie,"Uh, maybe leave the baking to me next time. [giggles, chewing] Actually, it's pretty good."
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,twilight sparkle,Chancellor Puddinghead's recipe.
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,pinkie pie,"Now, that's an impressive dessert!"
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,twilight sparkle,It's your Hearth's Warming present!
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,pinkie pie,Really? That's so thoughtful.
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,twilight sparkle,"It took a lot of research, but I<U+0097>"
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,shining armor,"Maybe focus on the task at hoof, Twily?"
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,twilight sparkle,"Right. The recipe needed to be exact. I think Flurry Heart added something while I wasn't looking, but I have no idea what to add to adjust it. A teaspoon of nutmeg, three sugarplums, extra<U+0097>"
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,pinkie pie,Gingerbread? Four more candy canes?
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,twilight sparkle,How do you know the recipe?
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,pinkie pie,I don't get it.
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,pinkie pie,"Happy Hearth's Warming, Twilight! I'm your Hearthswarming Helper!"
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,discord,"Uh, a bit reindeer ex machina, but... two thumbs way up! Whoo!"
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,twilight sparkle,"Sorry for failing as a Hearthswarming Helper, Pinkie."
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,rarity,"[sighs] At least Twilight has something to show for her effort. I ordered you a fabulous farm hat, Applejack. Alas, it decided it belonged to somepony else."
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,applejack,Pops said sometimes the hat chooses the pony when he gave me this. Hopefully my gift inspired whoever's wearin' it to be the best farmer ever.
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,rarity,"Uhhh, ooh... Something like that."
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,fluttershy,We're really sorry about your gifts.
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,applejack,We got a bit distracted with Flim and Flam's shenanigans.
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,rainbow dash,They're better than my gift. [sighs] Sorry about the winterzilla.
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,fluttershy,"[giggling] Oh, he's a big sweetheart. And he ended up being really helpful."
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,fluttershy,It was actually kind of nice to be the pony who saved the day for once.
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,discord,"Oh, really? You mean a giant beast that only Fluttershy could tame, making her the hero of Hearth's Warming Eve, was a great gift?"
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,discord,Imagine that.
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,rainbow dash,"[stutters, blows] You mean you tricked me into putting my friend in danger on purpose so you<U+0097>?!"
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,rainbow dash,Let's just say it was from both of us.
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,applejack,I guess Hearthswarming Helper was kind of a disaster.
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,princess cadance,I don't know. Ponyville always seems to have way more exciting holidays than the Crystal Empire.
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,spike,"There's one gift left, but I messed up, too. Your present's only kind of finished, Rarity, but I guess it's better than nothing."
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,spike,"I wanted to get you Something oh, so rare A gift to show I care But nothing can compare"
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,rarity,"Oh, Spike. A song is a lovely present."
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,spike,I wanted to get you the best gift ever. I just couldn't figure out what it was.
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,pinkie pie,"Ooh, ooh! The Gift Givers told me that! Oh, what was it? The best gift is more precious than gold, but it cannot be sold. When it breaks, it's not ended, for quickly it's mended. It can never be bought yet is easily sought."
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,pinkie pie,What's so funny?
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,twilight sparkle,"It's a riddle, and the answer is ""friendship""!"
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,twilight sparkle,The most magical gift That I can recall It could've been big or small Or even nothing at all
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,pinkie pie,The greatest gift you give to me Is more precious than gold
My Little Pony Best Gift Ever,Michael Vogel,pinkie pie,"Never ended, always mended And it can't be bought or sold"
